    Title: Increasing Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into neurons
    Abstract: Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development, yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms. In the C. elegans germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

   ., 2011; Patel et al., 2012 ). Here, we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model. This was unanticipated, since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden, 2007 ). To understand this novel, reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch, we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling

In the C. elegans germline, GLP-1Notch signaling is essential for maintaining a pool of undifferentiated stem cells/progenitors. Here, we report an unexpected role of GLP-1Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming. To understand this phenomenon, we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling

. elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al., 2002 ). Thus, the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2. The C. elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6 ( Bender et al., 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1. 3747; mes-3: fc 1. 003; mes-6: fc 1. 037 )

. When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values, the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2, 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—source data 1 ). In the C. elegans germline, X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C. elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al., 2002 )

. We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch, including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al., 2014 ). Additionally, and unexpectedly, we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2. We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target, utx-1

. However, whether these genes are activated by GLP-1Notch and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined. Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2, suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway, Notch, and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2

. While depleting most candidates in the rrf-1 background had similar effects on the germline as in the wild type ( suggesting germline-autonomous function ), in some cases the effects were abolished, suggesting that these genes function in the soma ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—source data 1 ). Strikingly, we noticed that Notch-activated genes were enriched on the X-chromosome, the C. elegans sex chromosome

. Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ). This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes

., 2012 ). Potentially, the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2, since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al., 2012 ). Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation, we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling

. Here, we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation. Interestingly, an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also been observed in T-cell leukemia ( Ntziachristos et al., 2012 )

. In C. elegans, signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and, during larval development, signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al., 2008; Djabrayan et al., 2012 )

. Some Notch-activated genes, such as sel-8/Mastermind, lst-1, and epn-1/Epsin, have been implicated in Notch signaling in other cell types ( Doyle et al., 2000; Yoo, 2004; Tian et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2011; Kershner et al., 2014 ). However, it remains possible that, rather than being direct GLP-1Notch targets, some of the Notch-activated genes were upregulated as an indirect consequence of increased GLP-1Notch signaling. 10. 7554/eLife. 15477. 008Figure 2

Cell-fate decisions are controlled, on the one hand, by intercellular signaling and, on the other hand, by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications. The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999; Greenwald and Kovall, 2013 ), which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al., 2010 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 15477. 013 To demonstrate that Notch-activated genes are functionally relevant for germ cell proliferation, we performed RNAi knockdown of Notch-activated genes ( n = 64 ) on animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele, and screened for enhancement or suppression of the tumorous gonad phenotype ( Supplementary file 1; for detailed experimental procedure see Materials and Methods )

. Importantly, UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2011; Vandamme et al., 2012 ). Thus, we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates.

. When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes ( 33 genes ), we noticed that half of these ( 18, all X-linked ) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal, but not the distal-most, gonads ( Supplementary file 2 ), arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1Notch in the wild type

. elegans sex chromosome. 45% of the Notch-activated genes were X-linked, which is four-fold more than expected by chance ( p=2. 99e-14; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—source data 1 )

. Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome, and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch, we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes. To determine whether Notch-activated and P2-repressed genes are co-regulated, we examined the expression of ut-1, a gene repressed by P2 ( Fong et al,2002 ) and activated by GL-1ch ( Kner et al,2014 ) We show that ut-1 is co-regulated by both GL-1ch and P2 ( Figure 2C ), indicating that GL-1ch and P2 have an antagonistic effect on ut-1 expression

In the C. elegans germl, GL-1ch signaling is known to maintain undifferentiated germl stem/proitor cells ( Kim and Critenden,2007 ). Here, we report an unexpected role of GL-1ch in promoting cell reprogram. To understand this phenomenon, we identified genes activated by increased GL-1ch signaling. eleg PRC (ong et al,200 ) Thus, the X bias among Not-activated suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GL-1ch and P2. The. eleg PRC consists of MES-, -, - ( Bender et al,200 ) levels of corresponding transcripts were not altered by GL-1ch ( mes- fc 1.374; mes- fc 1.003; mes- fc 1.037 ) When only genes with higher baseline germl expression, the proportion of Not-activated was even more striking ( fifteen more than expected by chance p2.19-38; Figure 2 and 2figure supplement 2, 2source 1 ) In the. germl, X genes are largely silenced by the P ( Fong et,200 )

We identified genes regulated by GL-1, including recently shown to maintain germl stem/proitor ( K et al,201 ) Additionally, and unexpectedly found that many activated by GL-1 were repressed the cell-stabilizing chromatin P2 We show GL- and P have antagonistic on cell-f decisions and co-regulate their target ut-1 However, whether these are by GL- and promote differentiation under physiological remains to be determined Many Not- are repressed by P suggesting that expression of these is by cros between the intercellular pathway, and intrinsic chrom modifier P2 While depleting candidates in r- had similar effects the as type suggesting germl-autonomous in some cases effects abolished suggesting function the ( Figure 2figure 3, 2source 1 ) Strikely we that Not- were enriched the X the chromosome the sex chromosome Nearly all X- were derepressed upon loss P ( Figure 2 ) This consistent with interaction suggests GL- can induce specific P-repressed genes.,201 ) Potentially depletion LIN- could reprogram by inhibiting P since loss results global H3me in the germl ( et al201 ) Considering between GL and P on proliferation gene we wondered whether triggered depletion P would sensitive Not signaling Here we that one activity U- may stimulated promote reprogram through signaling transcriptional activation antagonistic between Not and P also observed T-cell leukemia ( et al201 In, C signaling the GL- and LIN impedes reprogram during embryogenesis lar development signaling LIN required conversion rect epithelial motor ( et al,200 et ) Some-activated such as sel/Master, lst, ep/Ein implicated Notch other types ( et, et ; et ; et ; et ) however possible rather GL targets indirect consequence increased signaling 10.755/e 77 008 Figure 2-cell decisions controlled intercellular intrinsic epetic chrom modifications Notch pathway conserved widespread mechanism implicated celldecisions proliferation differentiation ( et Liu ) doi 10 4Life 77 013 demonstrate Not- functionally relevant germ proliferation performed RNA knockdown Not- on carrying gain-function gl- allele and screened enhancement suppression tumorous gon phenotype Supplementary detailed Materials Methods Importantly U- histoneerase erase geneil methylation histone dependent P ( et ; et ; Vandme

    Title: SKAP2 is required for defense against K. pneumoniae infection and neutrophil respiratory burst
    Abstract: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern. We show that the adaptor protein, SKAP2, is required for protection against K. pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections. Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells. Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumoniae infection in mice; however, K. pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished. K. pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs, Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. In conclusion, SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection.

    Supporting Text:
   . Sensitivity of K. pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection, and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al., 2017; Paczosa et al., 2020 ). In murine neutrophils, SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, demonstrating a critical role in K. pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production. Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al

Our experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K. pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a murine lung model of infection. SKAP2 was indispensable for K. pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophil ROS production, but not degranulation or phagocytosis, suggesting that the increased bacterial burden in the Skap2-/- mice is affected by the loss of ROS. Sensitivity of K

. Combined, these results indicate that the K. pneumoniae 43816 strain is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression, but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection. ROS is an important mechanism for protection against K. pneumoniae as mice that lack the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase, Cybb-/-, were significantly more susceptible to K

., 2007; Boras et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2016; Raab et al., 2017; Ophir et al., 2013 ). Using a murine model of K. pneumoniae 43816 infection, we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K. pneumoniae in this study. We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K. pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes. Using murine neutrophils, we show that K

. In summary, Skap2-/- neutrophils are defective in triggering the signaling cascade ( s ) required for ROS after K. pneumoniae binding to surface receptors. To investigate how SKAP2 mediates K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production, we first evaluated the requirement for several well-established proteins that are critical for receptor-mediated ROS production after K. pneumoniae infection

. Combined, these data indicate Skap2 expression in BM-derived immune cells is required to contain K. pneumoniae growth during lung infection, and that Skap2 expression in cells that are not derived from the marrow do not contribute to this phenotype. The contribution of neutrophils and iMOs to host defense against K. pneumoniae infection is dependent on the bacterial strain used with K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 being more susceptible to neutrophils ( Xiong et al., 2015; Silver et al

. Using murine neutrophils, we show that K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2, SFKs, Syk, PLCγ, Btk, and PKC, and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K. pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2.

., 2001; Xiong et al., 2015 ). The neutrophil-depleted WT mice had similarly high bacterial burdens as Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 2E ), and the depletion of Skap2-/- mice of neutrophils or iMOs did not increase their bacterial burden suggesting that protection against K. pneumoniae infection is SKAP2-dependent ( Figure 2E ). To assess the contribution of Skap2 expression in BM-derived iMOs and neutrophils in limiting K

. While SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 have been shown to be important for degranulation in murine and human neutrophils ( Van Ziffle and Lowell, 2009; Kamen et al., 2011; Mócsai et al., 1999; Han et al., 2003 ), we observed degranulation in murine lungs and low levels of phosphorylation after K. pneumoniae infection in murine neutrophils in vitro. These low levels may be sufficient to induced degranulation through a SKAP2-independent signaling pathway

., 2005; Zhao et al., 2015 ). However, we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2, degranulation in Skap2-/- mice was not sufficient to control K. pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS, indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K. pneumoniae infection. Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/- lungs, the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K

., 1997; Greenberger et al., 1996 ), future studies can use these K. pneumoniae strains to probe the role of SKAP2 in neutrophils as well as other hematopoietic cells during K. pneumoniae infections. In summary, neutrophils and their production of ROS play a dual role in host health in many disease states from acute infections to autoimmune diseases to cancer ( Hoffmann and Griffiths, 2018; Nguyen et al

. pneumoniae. To determine if SKAP2 is required for phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases, the levels of pSFKs, pSyk, and pPyk2 were assessed in Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils following K. pneumoniae exposure. While SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 phosphorylation were all slightly induced in Skap2-/- neutrophils, the level of induction was often significantly reduced as compared to WT neutrophils ( Figure 5F–L; Supplementary file 1 )

Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens such as Y. pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, among others ( Green et al., 2016; Mócsai, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2017 ). The immunological mechanisms of SKAP2-mediated neutrophil responses to other pathogens are under investigation. We propose the following model for SKAP2-dependent neutrophilic response to K

. pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production, and that the loss of SKAP2 prevents full phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 after K. pneumoniae stimulation such that neutrophils are unable to generate ROS production.

. pneumoniae-induced neutrophil responses. Furthermore, these data suggest that a functional NADPH complex can assemble in Skap2-/- neutrophils and that SKAP2 is required for receptor-activated signaling pathways downstream of integrin receptors, but not Fcγ receptors. Multiple neutrophil antimicrobial mechanisms, including degranulation, phagocytosis, and NETs, have been implicated in host defense against K. pneumoniae infection ( Chen et al., 2016; Ivin et al

. Skap2-/- mice that received WT BM and were then depleted of neutrophils with α-Ly6G showed an increase in bacterial load and that burden was similar to those in Skap2-/- mice that received Skap2-/- neutrophils ( Figure 2F ). By contrast, α-CCR2-treated mice had a similar bacterial burden as PBS-treated mice ( Figure 2F ). Together, these data indicate that neutrophils cannot control K. pneumoniae 43816 infection in the absence of SKAP2 in the hematopoietic compartment

. pneumoniae- and PMA-induced ROS ( Figure 5E; Rolán et al., 2013 ). This suggests SFKs, Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PK are required for K. pneumonia-stim ROS production in neutils and that SK2 is proximal to their activation in K. pneumonia-induced signaling pathways. The loss of SK2 significantly hindered K. pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of SFs, Sy, and Py2 implicating SK2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways.

    Title: Modelling the contribution of the hypnozoite reservoir to Plasmodium vivax transmission
    Abstract: Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection. We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites, and validate it against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The within-host model is embedded in a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

    Relapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P. vivax. Hypnozoites in the liver constitute a third malaria parasite reservoir, in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito also present for P. falciparum. Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir ( Roy et al

. In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites ( malERA Consultative Group on Diagnoses and Diagnostics, 2011 ), models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir, either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment.

., 2014 ). Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al., 2003; Chamchod and Beier, 2013; Roy et al., 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al., 1991 )

. Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, the blood and the liver

. In this manuscript, a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria

Following infection with a tropical strain of P. vivax, the population dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver can be described by a within-host model where each hypnozoite is subject to two processes: ( i ) activation leading to relapse infection; and ( ii ) death, either of the hypnozoite itself or the host hepatocyte ( Malato et al., 2011 ). Constant activation ( α ) and death ( µ ) rates are assumed implying hypnozoite residence time in the liver is exponentially distributed

. vivax. In the model implemented here, it is assumed that all hypnozoites in an infection must undergo some waiting period before any of them can activate, and that during the long-latency phase hypnozoites are at risk of death due to natural hepatocyte death. We next embedded the within-host model for tropical relapses in a model for the transmission of P. vivax between humans and mosquitoes ( Figure 8 )

. This is in spite of P. vivax being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world, causing in the region of 80–300 million clinical episodes every year ( Mueller et al., 2009a; Gething et al., 2012 ). P. falciparum models are not applicable to P. vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages ( hypnozoites ) which give rise to relapsing infections—one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of P

The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in P. vivax blood-stage prevalence, as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated.

This allows the intensity of hypnozoite infection to be estimated which is crucial for understanding patterns of relapse infections ( White, 2011 ) and evaluating the effect of interventions such as primaquine treatment that directly target the hypnozoite reservoir.

. See details of how treatment was implemented in the model are provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, 2. Increasing treatment coverage leads to reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Notably the reduction in the P. vivax hypnozoite rate is slow as the hypnozoite reservoir is not directly targeted. The hypnozoite reservoir can be directly targeted using a drug such as primaquine that can eliminate hypnozoites from the liver ( Wells et al., 2010 )

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04692. 006 Figure 3 shows the predicted number of relapsing hypnozoites in a population exposed to P. vivax in the absence of new infections. For tropical strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver is expected to decrease exponentially, but the proportion of individuals carrying hypnozoites is expected to decrease at a slower rate as an individual can relapse even if they have just one hypnozoite ( Figure 3A )

. By considering infection with batches of hypnozoites, these simple processes can explain many of the complex patterns observed in P. vivax relapses ( see Box 1 ). A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites. This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary P. vivax infection, in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2–3 weeks later

. However, as has been previously argued, periodicity in relapses could also be attributable to a cycle of fevers initiating hypnozoite activation which in turn cause new blood-stage infections and malaria-associated fevers ( White, 2011 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 04692. 005Figure 2.

The likelihood of the tropical relapse model can be evaluated by applying the model to the data on time to first relapse infection. The first detected relapse will occur after clearance of parasites from the blood and the hypzoites in the liver have time to activate ( Malato et al,201 ). The time to first relapse can be modelled as an exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1/α, where α is the rate of activation of hypnoites in the liver. The time to first relapse can be modelled as an exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1/α, where α is the rate of activation of hypnoites in the liver.

    Title: Carbon recovery dynamics following disturbance by selective logging in Amazonian forests
    Abstract: When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year, more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere. Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. With an original modelling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia, we link regional differences in climate, soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall, high seasonality ). We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.

Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ). Based on long-term ( 8–30 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al

Our study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8–30 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ).

. In this study, we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging. Because of its economic value and implications for forest management, selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests, and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent. We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e. g

With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al., 2016 ), climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al., 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al., 2008 ), we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss, which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2015; West et al., 2014 )

With on-going climate change, attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer, 2002 ), and in particular to the 2. 1 ± 1. 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al., 2014 ). Among those disturbances, selective logging, i. e

Contrasting post-disturbance ACS dynamics were detected among the western Amazon, Guiana Shield, and southern Amazon ( Figure 4 ). ( i ) In the western Amazon, environmental stress is reduced due to fertile soils and abundant, mostly non-seasonal precipitation, but forests are prone to frequent and sometimes large-scale wind-induced disturbances ( Espírito-Santo et al., 2014 )

., 2016 ) and competition ( Valladares and Niinemets, 2008 ), and because their height is lower than in mature forests ( Rutishauser et al., 2016 ), they might have reduced carbon sequestration potential. With ongoing climate change and increased frequencies and intensities of droughts in Amazonia ( Malhi et al., 2008 ), betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble

. e. the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species, is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone, about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 ( Asner et al., 2005 ). The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period, and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner, 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al., 2005 )

., 2012 ). Across Amazonia, survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery. In regions where survivors’ ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ), net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ), lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3–5 Mg C ha-1 yr−1 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al., 2016] )

. We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site’s average pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a⁢c⁢s⁢0 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) ], disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) ], and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ), seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ), and soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS

., 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework

. Yet post-disturbance ACS loss from survivors’ mortality decreases slowly in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 6 ). This is consistent with the low mortality rates and the high tree longevity reported in old-growth forests of this region ( Phillips et al., 2004 ). ( iii ) In the southern Amazon, high seasonal water stress is the main constraint on ACS recovery ( Wagner et al., 2016 ). Stress-tolerant trees are generally poor competitors ( He et al

., 2005 ). In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing, most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al., 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al., 2014 ). Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al., 2011 ), but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate, because while detecting selective logging from space is increasingly feasible ( Frolking et al

., 2013 ) and this may explain the slow ACS changes of survivors in this region ( Figures 4a, d and 6 ). Finally, Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al., 2012 )

., 2016] ). Recruits, for their part, have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia. Nevertheless, small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes. The 10–20 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al

. g. Gourlet-Fleury et al., 2005; Valle et al., 2007 ) or airborne light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) measurements ( e. g. Andersen et al., 2014 ) have assessed post-logging dynamics at particular sites. Nonetheless, to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available. C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i. e

., 2005 ) for annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation, and the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al., 2008 ) for topsoil bulk density; ( ii ) disturbance intensity is set to 40% of pre-logging ACS loss, which is common in Amazon ( Blanc et al,2009; Martin et al,2015; West et,2014 ) and (iii ) a 10- year recovery period, which is typical for forest regrowth after selective logging ( Blanc et al,2009 ; Martin et al,201 ; West et,2014 )

    Title: Prospective identification of functionally distinct stem cells and neurosphere-initiating cells in adult mouse forebrain
    Abstract: Neurosphere formation is commonly used as a surrogate for neural stem cell ( NSC ) function but the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) and NSCs remains unclear. We prospectively identified, and isolated by flow cytometry, adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( GEPCOT ) cells. They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2 and were long-lived in vivo. While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide, pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.

   . In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture ( Figure 4B ), and were quiescent in vivo ( Figure 4C ) but were long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al., 2012 ), GFAP-CreERT2 ( Giachino et al., 2013 ), Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al., 2011 ), and Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner, 2005; Lee et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 4F–J )

. We refer to these GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells as GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B ). GEPCOTs accounted for 3. 2 ± 0. 7% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 1B ). On average, 36 ± 6% of GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 74% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 1C ). Nearly all of the neurospheres ( 91% ) could be passaged ( data not shown )

By screening almost 400 antibodies against distinct cell surface antigens we identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ ( Figure 8 ). GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs ( Figure 1C ) and highly mitotically active in vivo ( Figure 1D ) but persisted only transiently in the SVZ based on fate mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 ( Figure 2B, C )

. SVZ NICs have been enriched by flow cytometry based on CD15 expression ( Capela and Temple, 2002 ) or ROS levels ( Le Belle et al., 2011 ). Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that NSCs express GFAP and that these cells sustainably contribute to neurogenesis in vivo ( Doetsch et al., 1997, 1999a, 1999b, 2002; Imura et al., 2003; Morshead et al., 2003; Garcia et al., 2004; Mirzadeh et al., 2008; Pastrana et al., 2009; Beckervordersandforth et al

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02669. 007 Whereas GEPCOTs were highly enriched for multipotent NICs ( Figure 1C ), pre-GEPCOTs were unable to form neurospheres. We sorted unfractionated SVZ cells into culture and found that 1. 9 ± 0. 5% of the cells formed neurospheres and 2. 0 ± 0. 4% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B )

. Here we report the prospective identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of cells in the SVZ: GEPCOT cells and pre-GEPCOT cells. The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 ± 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells, were highly quiescent, lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture, and included type B1 cells based on marker expression, morphology, and position in vivo

. Consistent with prior results ( Mirzadeh et al., 2008 ), we observed GFAPhigh cells at the center of the pinwheel structures with a single primary cilium on the apical surface contacting the ventricle and a long basal process ( Figure 4L ). Since many pre-GEPCOTs recombined with GFAP-CreERT2 but virtually no GEPCOTs did ( Figure 4I ), these data indicate that many pre-GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type B1 cells in the SVZ

. GlasthighEGFR−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− pre-GEPCOT cells are a quiescent, TMZ resistant population containing qNSCs that give rise to GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− GEPCOT cells that are highly mitotically active in vivo and enriched for NICs. pre-GEPCOT cells include Type B1 cells, GEPCOT cells include Type C cells, and neuroblasts make up Type A SVZ cells ( Doetsch et al., 1997; Doetsch et al., 1999a )

. ( C ) Frequency of all neurospheres ( >50 µm ) and multipotent neurospheres formed by unfractionated SVZ cells ( DAPI/CD45/Ter119− ), GEPCOT cells, and remaining live SVZ cells outside of the GEPCOT population ( n = 9 independent experiments ). ( D ) Frequency of BrdU+ SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells after BrdU pulses in vivo ( n = 5–11 mice/time point in 2–3 independent experiments ). ( E ) GEPCOT cells efficiently formed multipotent neurospheres in vitro and were mitotically active in vivo

. On average, each neurosphere gave rise to 53 ± 41 multipotent secondary neurospheres upon dissociation and replating, demonstrating self-renewal potential. Most NICs from the SVZ were contained within this GEPCOT population ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ). Given that individual NICs are unlikely to form colonies with 100% efficiency after dissociation and flow cytometry, most GEPCOT cells likely have the potential to form neurospheres

. Thus, our data demonstrate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombination is a marker of qNSCs that survive treatment with anti-mitotic agents and contribute to an increasing proportion of pre-GEPCOT cells, GEPCOT cells, and neuroblasts over time ( Figures 4I and 5M–P ). NSCs are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of cells in germinal zones in the adult mouse brain ( Doetsch et al., 1997; Mirzadeh et al., 2008; Pastrana et al., 2009 )

We enzymatically dissociated adult mouse SVZ cells then sorted cells by flow cytometry into non-adherent cultures at clonal density ( 0. 66 cells/µl of culture medium ). We always replated neurospheres to adherent secondary cultures to assess differentiation into TuJ1+ neurons, GFAP+ astrocytes, and O4+ oligodendrocytes. On average, 1. 8 ± 0. 4% of SVZ cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 75% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( 1. 4 ± 0

. These data suggest GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs that give rise to NICs, neuroblasts, and GF-CERT-expressing GEOT cells ( Figures 4I and 5–P ). GF-CERT-expressing pre-GEOT cells are qSCs that give rise to GF-CERT-express GEOT cells ( Figures 4 and 5–P ) GF-CERT-express GEOT cells are qSCs that give to GFERT-express GEOT ( Figures 4 and 5–P ) GFERT-express GEOT are qSC that give GFERT-ex GEOT ( Figures 4 and 5–P GFERT-ex GEOT are qSC that give GF-ex GE ( Figures 4 and 5–P GF-ex GE are qSC that GF ( Figures 4 and 5– GF-ex are qSC that GF ( Figures 4 and 5 GF are qSC that GF ( Figures 4 and GF are q that GF ( Figures 4 GF are q that GF ( Figures 4 are GF that GF ( Figures 4 GF that GF ( Figures GF that GF ( GF that GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF GF
Researchers investigated the function of Piezo1 ion channels, a mechanically gated ion channel that senses membrane tension with high sensitivity. Using cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp, they examined the spatial distribution and functional interactions of Pie1 channels across various densities. Their data, together with stochastic simulations of Pie1 distributions, showed that at endogenous densities (1-2 channels/μm2) and non-physiological densities (10-100/100/μm) predicted substantial overlap. However, Pie1 density had no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. The results suggest Pie channels, at physiologically relevant densities, inherently behave as mechanotrans. This property enables cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane.

The study used cell-attached-clamp electrophys to quantify channel number and function, including single current, open probability, and pressure. They sought to characterize the inherent ability of Pie channels to spatially localize and modulate each other's function. Pie1 channels were randomly distributed, with 80% outside a range of 2-3 channels, suggesting no functional interaction via membrane footprints. At high densities (up to 100/μm), Pie1 sensitivity did not change with number. Surprisingly, data suggest in absence of tension, Pie open probability slightly reduced with number, but overall low (<1% at all densities probed. Two analyses showed at densities 1-2/μm and 10-100/μ, Pie pressure and tension not modulated by number. Mechanistic explanation provided by data and model spatial distributions, suggesting NeuroA cells, Pie channels randomly distributed or low aggregating.

To measure and correlate Pie1 density with properties, they performed cell-attached-clamp electroph on NeuroA cells expressing Pie1. Functional interactions/cooperativity between force-gated channels may skew transduction or kinetics, depending on local density, creating patchwork blind and sensitized areas. Recent evidence suggests Pie channels non-uniformly distributed. Distribution fits data well, indicating NeuroA cells, Pie channels homously across surface rather localized. Conclusions applicable to cells expressing Pie similar levels to NeuroA, but specific types may concentrate channels locations detecting forces.

    Title: The influence of evidence volatility on choice, reaction time and confidence in a perceptual decision
    Abstract: Many decisions are thought to arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. In perception, the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy and confidence. It also makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy and, paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015 ) in that we ( i ) applied the manipulation to a well studied motion task for which much is known about the underlying physiology; ( ii ) verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque, and ( iii ) showed how a framework based on the bounded accumulation of evidence can account for the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time and confidence

We have shown that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision—what we term volatility—increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it. Testing the influence of volatility on the decision process is difficult, because it requires independent control over the signal and the noise in the evidence. We mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus

. We verified that the manipulation has the desired properties by recording from direction selective neurons in the middle temporal ( MT ) and medial superior temporal ( MST ) areas of the macaque visual cortex. Neurons in these areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in our study ( Salzman et al., 1990; Celebrini and Newsome, 1995; Ditterich et al., 2003; Fetsch et al., 2014 )

. Example stimuli can be seen in Video 1. We studied the relationship between volatility and decision speed with a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task ( Roitman and Shadlen, 2002 ). Three human participants completed 6631 trials ( subject S1: 2490 trials; S2: 2070; S3: 2071 ), and one macaque ( monkey W ) completed 14, 137 trials. Each trial started with subjects fixating on a central spot ( 0. 33° diameter ) for 0. 5 s. Then two targets ( 1

., 2003; Fetsch et al., 2014 ). We then used the volatility manipulation to test the influence of noise on the three observables of choice behavior—accuracy, RT and confidence—in monkeys and humans.

. Note that the effect is strongest at the low coherences, where the distribution of c in the high volatility condition spans both positive and negative values. These observations characterize the volatility present in the visual stimulus, but we are mainly interested in the noisy signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision. We therefore measured the impact of volatility on the response of direction selective neurons in cortical areas MT/MST ( Figure 2C )

. 5 ) to more extreme values. Therefore, we predicted that volatility would increase confidence at low coherences, for the same reason that it speeds the RT. To test this prediction, we used two variants of the motion task, tailored to the abilities of monkeys and humans. Monkey D was trained on a motion discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen, 2009 ) ( PDW; Figure 4A )

. However, characterization of these effects of TMS and µStim was inferred from behavior. Similarly, psychophysical studies that attempted to increase the noise through changes in the visual stimulus ( de Gardelle and Summerfield, 2011; Zylberberg et al., 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015 ) or attentional state ( Rahnev et al., 2011; Morales et al., 2015 ) did not characterize the influence of these manipulations on the neural signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision

. These neurons represent the momentary evidence used by monkeys to guide their choice, reaction time and confidence ( Salzman et al., 1990; Celebrini and Newsome, 1995; Ditterich et al., 2003; Fetsch et al., 2014 ) in motion discrimination tasks. As previously shown ( Britten et al., 1993 ), the firing rate of MT neurons increases linearly, on average, as a function of motion strength in the neuron’s preferred direction ( c > 0, Figure 2C, upper panel, blue trace )

. Noise is the main determinant of both RT and confidence when signal-to-noise is low, that is when choices are more stochastic ( less accurate ). Recent evidence from neurophysiology ( Kiani and Shadlen, 2009 ), brain stimulation ( Fetsch et al., 2014 ), and psychophysics ( Kiani et al., 2014 ) supports such a mechanism

. They were allowed to adjust their gaze to the desired level before finalizing their combined choice and confidence report ( Figure 5A ). We thus encouraged subjects to use all available information in the 200 ms stimulus for both reports ( Van den Berg et al., 2016 ). The results from the human observers were similar to those from the monkey. Naturally, subjects were more confident for high coherence stimuli ( Equation 21, p<10–6, t-test; Figure 5 )

., 2014 ) supports such a mechanism. If the bounded accumulation of noisy evidence underlies choice accuracy, RT and confidence, then a selective manipulation of the noise should produce quantitatively consistent effects on all three measures

. Because the volatility of the stimulus is not explicitly represented in this map, higher volatility would lead to greater confidence, because the decision variable diffuses more quickly from the starting point, leading paradoxically to states that are normally associated with more reliable sources. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 17688. 003 These predictions have not been tested thoroughly, because a controlled method for selectively increasing noise is not known

. Now we show how a single bounded accumulation model can account for the combined effect of motion strength and volatility on choice, accuracy and RT. In the model, choice, RT and confidence result from the accumulation of noisy momentary evidence as a function of time, until the integral of the evidence ( the decision variable, DV ) reaches one of two bounds, or for the PDW and confidence tasks, until the stimulus is curtailed

. For the monkey, a minimum time of 950 ms was imposed from dot onset to reward delivery ( e. g., Hanks et al., 2011 ) in order to discourage fast guessing. Trials employing 0% coherence motion were deemed correct with probability ½. A second monkey ( monkey D ) was trained to perform a direction discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen, 2009 ). After acquiring fixation, two targets appeared ( 6

. In addition to the estimate of variance from neural recordings, we used a 3-parameter characterization of the noise as a function of volatility and motion strength. The example is from the fit to behavioral data from monkey W in the reaction-time task. See Materials and methods for details. Note the similarity of this graph to the estimates derived from the neural recordings in Figure 2D ( lower panel ). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 17688

. We therefore sought a method to manipulate the variance associated with the neural representation of momentary evidence without affecting its mean. We achieved this with a manipulation of the motion information in a random dot motion ( RDM ) display, by adding a second level of randomness which increased its volatility but was unbiased with respect to the strength and direction of motion evidence

. e., during the delay ). The task design thus encouraged the monkey to perform the direction discrimination on every trial. After extensive experience with the standard RDM ( >100, 000 trials; low volatility condition ), we introduced the high volatility RDM on a random half of the trials. Single- and multi-unit recordings during performance of this task furnished the data for Figure 2C–D, as well as additional neurophysiological analyses described later. 10. 7554/eLife. 17688

. g., effort and/or time ). The role of the neural data in this study was to validate and characterize the volatility manipulation in a population of neurons known to represent the momentary evidence used to inform decisions and confidence ( Salzman et al., 1990; Ditterich et al., 2003; Hanks et al., 2006; Fetsch et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, there are features of this limited data set which are germane to findings associated with the confidence task in particular. For example, neurons in MT and MST are known to be selective for motion direction and speed ( Britten et al. 1993; Celebrini and Newsome 1995 ), but not for the strength of the motion signal. We found that neurons in these areas were more active when the motion was stronger ( Figure 2C, upper panel, blue trace ), but not when it was more variable ( Figure 2, lower panel, red trace ). This is consistent with the idea that neurons in these areas represent the momentary evidence used by the monkey to guide their choice and confidence, but not the noise associated with it

The results from the macaque are consistent with the predictions of a bounded accumulation model of evidence ( Figure 3 ). The effect of volatility on RT and confidence are quantitatively consistent with the predictions of the model. The effect of volatility on accuracy is less clear, but consistent with the idea that noise is the main determinant of accuracy when signal-to-noise is low, that is when choices are more stochastic ( less accurate ). The effect of volatility on confidence is consistent with the idea that noise is the determinant of confidence when signal-no is low, that is when choices are more stochastic ( less accurate ). The effect of volatility on RT is consistent with the idea that noise is the determinant of RT when signal-no is low, that when choices are stochastic ( less accurate ). The effect of volatility on confidence is consistent with the idea that noise is the determinant of confidence when signal-no is low, that when choices are stochastic ( less accurate ). The effect of volatility on RT is consistent with the idea that noise is the determinant of RT when signal-no is low, that choices are stochastic ( less ) accurate. The effect of volatility on confidence is consistent with the idea that noise is the determinant of confidence when signal-no is low, that choices are stochastic ( less ) accurate. The effect of volatility on RT is consistent with the idea that noise is determinant of RT when signal-no is low, choices stochastic ( less ) accurate. The effect of volatility on confidence is consistent with idea that noise determinant confidence when-no signal is low, choices stochastic ( accurate ). The effect of volatility on RT is consistent with that noise determinant RT signal-no low, choices stochastic ( accurate ). The effect of volatility on confidence is consistent with that noise confidence-no signal low, choices stochastic ( accurate.

    Title: CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16
    Abstract: The insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors of mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin ( PP2B phosphatase ) also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Herein, we show that TAX-6•CNB-1 and UNC-43, the C. elegans Calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II ( CAMKII ) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin.

   ., 2011 ). However, direct targets of worm Calcineurin have not been identified. In the current work, we addressed how worm Calcineurin TAX-6•CNB-1 regulates lifespan. We discovered that DAF-16 was phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 ( S286 ) site. The phosphoryl group was removed by TAX-6•CNB-1. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 therefore regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16

Our data suggest that CAMKII ( UNC-43 ) and Calcineurin ( TAX-6•CNB-1 ), by phosphorylating or de-phosphorylating serine 286 of DAF-16, extend or shorten the lifespan of C. elegans. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that, with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal ( Ca2+/CAM ), UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16

. In both cases, the nuclear accumulation induced by unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) was greatly diminished by daf-18 RNAi ( Figure 8B ). Therefore, under conditions in which there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16, the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate. 10. 7554/eLife. 00518. 021Figure 8. Insulin signaling overpowers CAMKII and Calcineurin in regulation of DAF-16 localization in C. elegans

Multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling ( IIS ), germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction, regulate aging in C. elegans ( Kenyon, 2005; Greer and Brunet, 2008 ). The best characterized is the IIS pathway, which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16

. In C. elegans, Calcineurin regulates body size, thermotaxis, muscle contraction, and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2007 ). The longevity phenotype of tax-6 ( lf ) is partially dependent on daf-16 ( Dong et al., 2007 ). More recent studies have shown that C. elegans Calcineurin can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy ( Dwivedi et al., 2009 ) or inactivating CRTC-1, a co-activator of CREB ( Mair et al

A genetic analysis has shown that a daf-16 ( null ) allele partially suppresses the longevity of the tax-6 ( lf ) mutant ( Dong et al., 2007 ). This observation suggested that daf-16 is either a direct or indirect downstream target of C. elegans Calcineurin; alternatively, it acts independently

. Previously, loss-of-function ( lf ) mutants for tax-6 and cnb-1, which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of C. elegans Calcineurin, respectively, were found to live longer than wild-type ( WT ) worms ( Dong et al., 2007 ). In mammalian systems, Calcineurin ( PP2B ) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that has diverse functions and affects both T cell activation and heart development ( Crabtree, 1999 ). In C

. Although RNAi knockdown of tax-6 during adulthood increased the lifespan of WT worms ( Figure 2B, Figure 2—source data 1A ), it failed to increase the lifespan of unc-43 ( null ) animals ( Figure 2C, Figure 2—source data 1A ). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Calcineurin removes the activating phosphorylation on DAF-16 caused by UNC-43

. When expressed in daf-16 ( mu86 ) animals, the DAF-16 ( S286D ) ::6xHis::GFP protein accumulated in the nucleus, whereas the WT DAF-16::6xHis::GFP protein was cytoplasmic, as expected ( Figure 6E ). Moreover, the phosphomimetic of DAF-16, but not the WT version, significantly increased the C. elegans lifespan in daf-16 ( null ) animals ( Figure 6F, Figure 6—source data 1C )

. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mammalian CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate phosphorylation of FOXO3 at the same conserved site as in C. elegans ( S298 in mouse FOXO3 and S286 in DAF-16 ). A recent study by Ozcan et al. shows that four non-AKT phosphorylation sites are involved in the activation of murine FOXO1 by CAMKIIγ, likely through the p38 MAP kinase, in glucagon-stimulated hepatocytes ( Ozcan et al., 2012 )

. It is likely that UNC-43/Calcineurin is responsible for activating DAF-16 when worms experience a variety of stress signals, including heat stress, oxidative stress, or prolonged starvation ( Figure 6G ). Food deprivation acts through UNC-43 to suppress spontaneous sex-muscle contraction in C. elegans males ( LeBoeuf et al., 2007 ). Reported in HEK293T cells, human FOXO3 is phosphorylated at non-AKT sites under stress conditions such as heat shock or H2O2 treatment ( Brunet et al

. In contrast, they all live longer than WT worms. Therefore, Calcineurin must counteract a different kinase that activates DAF-16. We reasoned that nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 in the tax-6 ( null ) background should be dependent on a kinase that initiated the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of DAF-16. Inactivation of this kinase should abolish the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP in tax-6 ( null ) animals

. The only known example is PPTR-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, which directs PP2A to dephosphorylate AKT-1 at T350, thereby inactivating the kinase ( Padmanabhan et al., 2009 ). DAF-18, the C. elegans PTEN, is a phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) 3-phosphatase ( Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ). The phosphatase for DAF-2 has not been identified, nor the one that regulates DAF-16

. From these results, we conclude that CAMKIIA and Calcineurin oppose each other in the regulation of D-16 in C. elegans, with UNC-43 phosphorylating and activating D-16, while TAX-6B1 dephosphorylating and inactivating it.
Researchers studied how fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements and found that motor programs are organized in a hierarchy. They genetically activated subsets of neurons to drive distinct cleaning programs for individual body parts, demonstrating that programs are organized in a suppression hierarchy. When one body part is cleaned, the sensory drive to its motor is reduced, relieving suppression of the next movement, allowing the sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring evoked movements in parallel but selected through hierarchical suppression successfully reproduced the grooming sequence. This is the first example of an innate sequence implemented by a model for generating human actions.

 The study found that dust elicits different evoked cleaning programs for body parts that progress in series. By targeting subsets, they gained control over each program to demonstrate they are organized in suppression. An empirically derived model shows how hierarchy can mediate the selection of cleaning programs. Evolutionary ability to select behaviors through suppression may have provided infrastructure to perform actions in sequence. Activation and parallel models describe mechanisms generating sequential behavior, but hierarchical suppression is a feature of parallel models, not chain models. The study organizational underlying control of serial action in an innate behavior, grooming, common to most animals, was investigated.

A significant finding is the demonstration that hierarchical among behaviors leads to emergence of sequence. Identifying neural circuit for each module and how they interact will reveal organization of behavior in nervous system through suppression. The model generates behaviors of complexity. Fruit grooming provides insight into organization of motor sequences. The model progression features proposed to explain sequences that require parallel activation of units competing for output. Each part cleaned, suppression of other modules is lifted, and new competition between remaining occurs. Work supports view that hierarchical is ubiquitous in action mechanism, whether selecting choices or movements in serial tasks.

Grooming displays sequential and cyclic transitions between modules, extending understanding of parallel in serial behavior. Flies make frequent between cleaning and rubbing, oscillations explained by hierarchical rules. Inhibition among motor programs may be due shared circuits, activity of program suppresses another because shared components cannot drive two behaviors. Experiments will address neural mechanisms hierarchical in grooming.

    Title: Sgol2 provides a regulatory platform that coordinates essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes
    Abstract: Accurate chromosome segregation depends on coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( K-fibers ), a process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ). How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2’s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.

    Supporting Text:
   . Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2, it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK, and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores. Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes

. On the contrary, depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I. These include inefficient SAC silencing, greatly increased bivalent stretching, and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ). We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2’s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1

. It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, caused increased bivalent stretching, and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores, which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments. Lastly, Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/CCdc20 activation, suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC

. What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and lastly Aurora B/C kinases. Crucially, by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes, we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in sgol2Δ/Δ oocytes is not due to knock on effects ( secondary or even tertiary pathology ) of eliminating a single function

. We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin, as found for Sgo1 in yeast ( Xu et al., 2009 ). However, if this were the sole function of Sgol2, then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected. To our surprise, we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics

., 2011 ). Shugoshins, though not explicitly Sgol2, have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase, necessary both for the SAC and for error correction ( Tsukahara et al., 2010; Yamagishi et al., 2010 ). Based on its interactions, Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and error correction pathways. However, the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 003 To investigate whether association of PP2A with Sgol2’s coiled coil is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion, we compared the effect of the mutations on PP2A’s co-localization with Sgol2 at kinetochores with their effect on the maintenance of cohesion after oocytes have undergone the first meiotic division

. 10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 023Figure 8. Sgol2 promotes bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes by increasing kinetochore-microtubule interactions. ( A ) To study the relative distributions of chromosomes on the ball shaped spindle, at 2–3 hr post-GVBD, oocytes were treated with Ca2+ buffer for 90 s and then fixed in 1% PFA. Cells were stained with anti-β-tubulin ( microtubules, green ), CREST ( kinetochores, red ), and DAPI ( chromosomes, blue ). Scale bars represent 5 μm

. The correlation between the effects of mutations on binding PP2A in vitro and on protecting cohesion in vivo implies that the interaction of PP2A with Sgol2’s coiled coil is essential for protecting cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division. 10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 004Figure 2. Sgol2-PP2A interaction is required to recruit PP2A to kinetochores and protect centromeric cohesion at the first meiotic division. ( A ) GV oocytes were harvested in the presence of IBMX

. Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2, it is surprising that sgol2Δ/Δ oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy. Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion. We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways

. Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes ( Figure 11 ). Why so much regulation is embedded into a single protein is unclear, but we speculate that this helps the coordination of multiple processes necessary for high fidelity chromosome segregation. 10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 026Figure 11. Graphical summary of sequence features, interactions and key functions of Sgol2 in mouse oocytes. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 026

. This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation

. Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear. Irrespective of its precise spatial and dynamic properties, this negative feedback loop may be an important feature of meiosis I

. The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II. Centromeric cohesin avoids phosphorylation and therefore cleavage during the first meiotic division because separase activation is preceded by the recruitment to centromeres of orthologues of the Drosophila MEI-S332 protein, called shugoshins

Previous work has shown that Sgol2 is essential for protection of centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al., 2008; Llano et al., 2008 ). Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2’s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism, namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres. PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly, by binding ( Holland et al

. 0001 ), regulation of bivalent stretching by Sgol2 does not depend on its ability to bind PP2A or Mad2. Thus, the effect cannot be due to changes either in arm cohesion protection or duration of metaphase I. 10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 013Figure 6. Sgol2 assists in bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes on the metaphase plate. Time-lapse confocal microscopy images from oocytes expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK

., 2009 ). Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 ( Sgol1 ), and Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ). The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the ‘prophase pathway’ that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis ( McGuinness et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2013 ). Sgol2, on the other hand, protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al

. 00410. 7554/eLife. 01133. 005Figure 3. Sgol2-PP2A, but not Sg1-PPA, recruits PP2 to kinchores and protects centrom cohes at the first meiotic. ( A GV oocytes were harvested in the presence IBMX and stained with anti-β-tub ( microtub, green ), C ( kinchores red ) and DAPI ( chromosomes, blue ). Scale bars 5 μm

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the role of Shug-like protein 2 (Sg2) in mammalian oocytes during meiosis I. They found that S2 plays a crucial role in turning off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, facilitating kinetochore-microtule (K-fiber) formation, and limiting bivalent stretching. S2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, while its ability to silence SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity, respectively. By virtue of its interactions, S2 links multiple processes for faithful chromosome segregation. Depletion of S2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetochore-microtule attachments. S2 silences SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar motif to Mad's partners Cdc20 and Mad1. Delayed bi-orientation of bival on meiosis spind, increased bivalent, and Aurora/C activity at kinetores, accompanied by increase in lateral and decrease in kinetoch-microt attachments.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome. Research has shown that experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require localized RNA and protein synthesis, with local translation altering synapse structure and function during formation and plasticity. This study investigates whether local stimulation also triggers RNA transport from the nucleus to synapses. Imaging in cultured Aplyia sensory-motor neurons, RNAs were delivered throughout the neuron's arbor, but translation was enriched at sites of contact and stimulation. Investigation of mechanisms revealed a role for calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation. Spatially regulating gene expression by translation rather than delivering RNAs to synapses maximizes the neuron's readiness to respond to local cues.

 The study found that RNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the neuron, but translation was significantly at synaptic and stimulated sites. This indicates regulation of gene expression in Aplyia sensory neurons is primarily at the level of translation, not RNA targeting from the nucleus. Overexpression of recombinant netrin-1 in MNs increased synaptic strength and sensorin immunoreactivity. Netrin-1 is a retrograde signal driving translation in the neuron, promoting axonal growth, synaptogenesis, and transmembrane regulation in dendrites and axons. Transcripts, ribosomes, and translational machinery were delivered throughout the neuron, but translation was selectively activated in response to stimuli.

 The study used the Aplyia-MN culture system to monitor mRNA localization and translation during synapse formation and plasticity, finding the proteome regulated at the level of translation rather than stimulus-induced targeting. Netrin-1 was able to stimulate translation at non-syn sites, suggesting a large number of transcripts localize throughout the neuron. The subcell localization of mRNA is secondary to the localization of the netrin signal, not in the synaptic per se to be translated. The study shows a pathway in axon guidance regulates synapse by spatially restricting gene expression, further uncoupling transcriptional and translational regulation in neurons.

    Title: Spatiotemporal mosaic self-patterning of pluripotent stem cells using CRISPR interference
    Abstract: Morphogenesis involves interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations. Our in vitro system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC ) colonies. We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell-cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) with CRISPR interference. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . We employed an inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. We genetically induced controlled symmetry-breaking events within hiPSC populations by creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown ( KD )

., 1994; Przybyla et al., 2016; Ringwald et al., 1987 ), and its down-regulation parallels the induction of patterning events via differential adhesion ( Figure 1A ). In this study, we explored whether mechanical manipulation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) sub-populations results in controllable cell driven self-organization into repeatable patterns

., 2004; Salbreux et al., 2012 ). However, these methods can’t selectively discriminate between different cells, or they fail to address how the emergence of heterotypic interactions affects multicellular organization. Here, we report that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns

. Mosaic KD was employed to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation. We show that induction of mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in a ‘bottom-up’ cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency.

. Ultimately, this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.

. However, differences in maturation or cell type within a germ lineage may assist in the controlled co-emergence of multiple cell types that normally interact within a single tissue, such as parenchymal cells along with stromal populations. Overall, this study capitalized on the ability of CRISPRi to temporally perturb specific molecular regulators of physical cell properties, such as adhesion and tension, that resulted in differing multicellular patterns

. Furthermore, ROCK1/CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed cell junction-localized β-catenin in pure colonies after 6 days of CRISPRi induction, suggesting maintenance of adherens junctions and epithelial colonies ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Since the decrease of CDH1 is commonly associated with loss of pluripotency in PSCs, the expression and localization of the common pluripotency transcription factors, OCT3/4 and SOX2, were examined

. Specifically, we demonstrate that mosaic KD of target genes ROCK1 or CDH1 result in distinct patterning events wherein cell-driven segregation dictates colony organization without loss of pluripotency ( Figure 5 ). ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin contraction ( McBeath et al., 2004 ) and facilitates expansion of PSCs ( Ohgushi et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015 ), and its acute inhibition by small molecules leads to a ‘relaxed’ cell phenotype with decreased stiffness ( Kinney et al

. ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies maintained an epithelial morphology throughout 6 days of CRISPRi silencing ( Figure 3A ) with no observed migration by CRISPRi-modulated cells away from the colonies. Both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD hiPSCs within mixed colonies expressed EpCAM at cell-cell boundaries after 6 days of CRISPRi induction despite changes in cortical tension or intercellular adhesion due to loss of ROCK1 or CDH1, respectively ( Figure 3A )

. Overall, the inducible CRISPRi mixed colonies displayed the ability to mimic several different patterns of intrinsic symmetry-breaking events that resulted in distinct cell sorting and multicellular pattern formation. In addition to the changes in organization within colonies, significant changes were observed in the final cell ratios starting from an original seeding density of 3:1 WT to CRISPRi cells

. However, when direct measurements of hiPSC elasticity were taken using atomic force microscopy after 6 days of KD, ROCK1 KD cells displayed a twofold higher cortical stiffness than the control and CDH1 KD populations, whereas the latter groups did not differ from one another ( Figure 1F ). Therefore, CRISPRi silencing of targeted genes associated with cellular mechanical properties resulted in distinct physical differences between the otherwise similar cell populations

. Therefore, the system described here enables interrogation of multicellular organization and morphogenic processes in parallel via manipulation of local multicellular domains through subpopulation organization and priming to specific lineage fates. In addition to changes in multicellular organization as a result of ROCK1 or CDH1 KD, changes in gene expression also occurred in the WT population

. To determine whether pattern emergence was impacted by the relative proportion of mosaic KD within a colony, KD cells were mixed with control CRISPRi hiPSCs lacking any gRNA or fluorescent protein at varying cell ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1. Clustering of ROCK1 KD cells was less apparent as the proportion of ROCK1 KD cells within a colony increased

., 2017; Warmflash et al., 2014 ). The observed mosaic patterns of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs demonstrate that the spatial location within a colony can be affected by targeted gene KD without altering differentiation potential, and conversely, the mosaic CDH1 KD demonstrates dual control of spatial positioning and lineage potential

. The emergence of autonomous cell patterning and cell sorting is often coincident with the onset of differentiation, and CDH1 in particular regulates morphogenesis in a diverse range of species ( Burdsal et al., 1993; Li et al., 2010 ). Historically, CDH1 is often associated with pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells ( Li et al., 2012; Soncin and Ward, 2011 )

., 2013; Mandegar et al., 2016 ). CRISPRi silencing enables temporal regulation over knockdowns ( KD ) of specific genetic targets with limited off-target effects. Temporal KD constraints enable the development of precisely-controlled engineered biological systems that can induce well-defined genetic perturbation at explicit times and within defined populations of cells to mimic developmental symmetry-breaking events

. In cortical tension-dominated sorting, variable actin cytoskeleton-generated cortex tension stimulates sorting of individual cells, whereas differential adhesion sorting promotes segregation of cell populations due to intercellular homophilic adhesions. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase ( ROCK1 ) and E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) are interesting orthogonal gene targets to interrogate hPSC population organization by altering the intrinsic mechanics of distinct cell populations

. To examine whether mosaic KD of a single molecule impacted hiPSC organization, ROCK1- or CDH1-CRISPRi populations were pretreated with DOX for 5 days and mixed with isogenic wildtype hiPSCs that constitutively expressed GFP ( WT-GFP ) at a 1:3 ratio. Forced aggregation of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs or CDH1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs and subsequent re-plating were used to create individual colonies of randomly mixed ROCK1 KD hiPSCs or CDH1 KD hiPSCs with the WT-GFP cells ( Figure 2A )

. The high variation between biological replicates potentially indicates that silencing of CDH1 induces a large variability in the gene regulation of BRA and SOX9 and could indicate that the cells experience a transient fluctuation in the pluripotency state. However, these results indicate that the loss of ROCK1 or CDH1 is not sufficient to disrupt the pluripotent gene regulatory network and induce an immediate exit from the pluripotent state

., 2014; Lee et al., 2006 ). However, we found that prolonged silencing of ROCK1 in hiPSCs ( 6 days ) resulted in cells that were twofold stiffer than WT hiP ( Figure 1F ), whereas CD1 KD hiSC were not significantly different from WT hiP. This indicates that KD of CD1 does not affect the mechanical properties of hiP cells, whereas KD of ROCK1 does

The results indicate that KD of ROCK or CD1 results in distinct patterning of hiP colonies without loss of pluripotency, and that KD of CD1 does not affect the mechanical properties of hiP cells, whereas KD of ROCK does. This study demonstrates the ability of CRISi to interrogate multicellular organization and morphogenesis in hiP cells by silencing genes that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension, and that KD of ROCK or CD1 results in distinct patterning of hiP without loss of pluripot, and that KD of CD1 does not affect the mechanical properties of hiP, whereas KD of ROCK does.

    Title: A resource-rational theory of set size effects in human visual working memory
    Abstract: Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive "limitations" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.

    Supporting Text:
    Descriptive models of visual working memory ( VWM ) have evolved to a point where there is little room for improvement in how well they account for experimental data. Nevertheless, the basic finding that VWM precision depends on set size still lacks a principled explanation. Here, we examined a normative proposal in which expected task performance is traded off against the cost of spending neural resource on encoding

. Our theory might apply beyond working memory tasks. In particular, it has been speculated that the selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against the costs associated with spiking ( Pestilli and Carrasco, 2005; Lennie, 2003 ). Our theory provides a normative formalism to test this speculation and may thus explain set size effects in attention tasks ( Lindsay et al., 1968; Shaw, 1980; Ma and Huang, 2009 )

. We tested the model on data from nine previous delayed-estimation experiments and found that it accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability, despite having relatively few parameters. Moreover, it accounts for a non-monotonicity that appears to exist between set size and the total amount of resource that subjects invest in item encoding

. The total amount of resource that subjects spend on item encoding may vary non-monotonically with set size in our model. At the neural level, this translates to a prediction of a non-monotonic relation between population-level spiking activity and set size. We are not aware of any studies that have specifically addressed this prediction, but it can be tested using neuroimaging experiments similar to previously conducted experiments. For example, Balan et al

., 2016 ) that make it impossible to compute J¯optimal without error, such that the outcome of the computation will vary from trial to trial even when the stimuli are identical. In the present study, we have focused on effects of set size and probing probability on encoding precision. However, our theory also makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision, because such manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function

. For these subjects, the error distributions on items with pi<p0 look uniform ( see Figure 4C for an example ) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for uniformity did not reject the null hypothesis in any of these cases ( p>0. 05 in all tests ). These results suggest that there might be a principled reason why people sometimes leave task-relevant items out of visual working memory in delayed-estimation experiments. However, our model cannot explain all previously reported evidence for this

. Similarly, our theory assumes that there is no lower limit on the amount of resource available for encoding. However, there is evidence that task-irrelevant stimuli are sometimes automatically encoded ( Yi et al., 2004; Shin and Ma, 2016 ), perhaps because in natural environments few stimuli are ever completely irrelevant. This would mean that there is a lower limit to the amount of resource spent on encoding

., 2014 ). Our normative theory allows for a reinterpretation of this question: are there situations in which it is optimal to assign zero resource to the encoding of an item? We already established that this could happen in delayed-estimation tasks: whenever the probing probability is lower than a threshold value p0=λ| c¯behavioral ( 0 ) |, the optimal amount of resource to invest on encoding the item is zero ( see Theory )

. However, a difference concerns the timescale at which the optimization takes place: while optimization in the context of neural coding is typically thought to take place at the timescale over which the statistics of the environment change or a developmental timescale, the theory that we presented here could optimize on a trial-by-trial basis to follow changes in task properties. We already mentioned the information-theory models of working memory developed by Chris R. Sims et al

. Consistent with the predictions of this theory, empirical work has found that the neural activity associated with the encoding of an item decreases with set size, as observed in for example the lateral intraparietal cortex ( Churchland et al., 2008; Balan et al., 2008 ) and superior colliculus ( Basso and Wurtz, 1998 )

. Neuroimaging studies might provide insight into whether and how coding efficiency changes with age, for example by estimating the amount of neural activity required per unit of precision in memory representations. Our work fits into a broader tradition of normative theories in psychology and neuroscience ( Table 4 )

. 358 ± 0. 026. To test the predictions presented in the previous section and, more generally, to evaluate how well our model accounts for effects of pi on encoding precision, we fit it to data from three experiments in which probing probability was varied independently of set size ( E7-E9 in Table 1 ). In the first of these experiments ( E7 ), seven subjects performed a delayed-estimation task at set sizes 2, 4, and 8

. To the best of our knowledge, evidence for a possible non-monotonicity in the relation between set size and total encoding resource has not been reported before. As we noted before, the model predictions do not explicitly depend on set size, N. Yet, we found that the model accounts well for set size effects in the experiments that we considered so far ( E1-E6 ). This happens because in all those experiments, N was directly coupled with probing probability pi, through pi = 1/N

. First, similar to early models of visual working memory limitations, they postulate a fixed total amount of resources ( formalized as channel capacity ), which is a constraint rather than a cost. Second, even if it had been a cost, it would have been the expected value of a log probability ratio. Unlike neural spike count, a log probability ratio does not obviously map to a biologically meaningful cost on a single-trial level

. The costs plotted in Figure 2E can be considered as obtained by multiplying the corresponding costs in Figure 2D by N. The model thus predicts set size effects in delayed-estimation tasks that are fully mediated by individual-item probing probability. The latter notion is consistent with empirical observations. Palmer et al. ( 1993 ) reported that "relevant set size" ( where irrelevance means pi = 0 ) acts virtually identically to actual set size. Emrich et al

., 2018 ). However, as Nassar et al. assumed a fixed total resource and did not take neural encoding cost into account in their optimization, it remains to be seen whether chunking is also optimal in the kind of model that we proposed. We speculate that this is likely to be the case, because encoding multiple items as one will reduce the expected neural cost ( fewer items to encode ), while the increase in expected behavioral cost will be negligible if the items are very similar

., 1968; Shaw, 1980; Ma and Huang, 2009 ). Furthermore, developmental studies have found that that working memory capacity estimates change with age ( Simmering and Perone, 2012; Simmering, 2012 ). Viewed from the perspective of our proposed theory, this raises the question of why the optimal trade-off between behavioral and neural cost would change with age

. Some form of divisive normalization ( Bays, 2014; Carandini and Heeger, 2012 ) would be a likely candidate, which is already a key operation in neural models of attention ( Reynolds and Heeger, 2009 ) and visual working memory ( Bays, 2014; Wei et al., 2012 ). The essence of this mechanism is that it lowers the gain when set size is larger, without requiring explicit knowledge of the set size prior to the presentation of the stimuli

. Hence, just as in the delayed-estimation task, there are conditions in which it is optimal to encode only a subset of items. An important difference, however, is that in the delayed-estimation task this only happens when items have unequal probing probabilities, while in this change detection task it even happens when all items are equally likely to change. Simulations at larger set sizes quickly become computationally intractable, because of the reason mentioned above

. For example, a recent study reported that in a whole-report delayed-estimation experiment ( pi = 1 for all items ), subjects encoded about half of the six presented items on each trial ( Adam et al., 2017 ). Unless additional assumptions are made, our model cannot account for this finding. The model assumes that there is no limit to the amount of resource that can be spent on encoding an item. However, there is evidence that task-irrelevant stimuli are automatically encoded ( Yi et al,200; Shin and Ma 2016 ) perhaps because in natural environments few stimuli are completely irrelevant. This would mean that there is a limit to the amount of resource that can be spent on an item

Our normative theory allows a reinterpretation of this question: are there situations in which it is optimal to assign zero resource to the encoding of an item We already established this could happen in delayed-est tasks whenever the probing is lower than a threshold p=|cbehavioral 0 | the amount of resource to invest on the item is zero see Theory. However, a concerns the timescale at which the optimization takes place while optimization in the context of neural is typically thought to take timescale over the statistics of the environment or developmental timescale the theory we presented could optimize trial-by-trial to changes in task.

    Title: An effector of the Irish potato famine pathogen antagonizes a host autophagy cargo receptor
    Abstract: Plants use autophagy to safeguard against infectious diseases. However, how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. Here, we show that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.

   ., 2012 ). In this study, we show that a plant pathogen effector has evolved an ATG8 interacting motif to bind with high affinity to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulate the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling

. RXLR effectors form a diverse family of modular proteins that alter a variety of host processes and therefore serve as useful probes to dissect key pathways for pathogen invasion ( Morgan and Kamoun, 2007; Bozkurt et al., 2012 ). Here, we show that the RXLR effector PexRD54 has evolved to bind host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. In addition, PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes to counteract host defenses against P

Furthermore, how adapted plant pathogens manipulate defense-related autophagy and/or subvert autophagy for nutrient uptake is unknown. In this study, we investigated how a pathogen interferes with and coopts a plant autophagy pathway

., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010 ). Future studies will need to consider pathogen-directed modulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection. It will be interesting to determine whether other plant pathogens also secrete effectors that evolved an ATG8 interacting motif or target autophagy in other ways. These effectors would serve as valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy.

. The physiological roles of selective autophagy and the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be determined both in plants and animals. Characterization of additional host cargo receptors and interactome analysis of particular ATG8 proteins should improve our understanding of how selective autophagy operates in response to a variety of stress conditions including immunity. In the potato genome, we identified nine ATG8 genes

. Both PexRD54J2AIM1 and PexRD54J2AIM2 associated with ATG8CL to a lesser extent than wild-type PexRD54 ( Figure 6D ), and were less effective than PexRD54 in depleting Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 6 ). These findings reveal that PexRD54 antagonizes Joka2 for ATG8CL binding. Finally, we investigated the degree to which activation of Joka2-ATG8CL-mediated autophagy contributes to pathogen defense

. Joka2, but not Joka2AIM, also markedly increased the number of GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3, Video 4 ), and enhanced ATG8CL protein levels ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). This indicates that Joka2 also activates ATG8CL-mediated selective autophagy. 10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 022Figure 6. PexRD54 is a competitive antagonist of the plant selective autophagy cargo receptor Joka2. ( A ) Domain organization of Joka2

. Remarkably, PexRD54 counteracted the enhanced resistance conferred by Joka2 whereas PexRD54AIM2 failed to reverse this effect ( Figure 7C–D ). We conclude that PexRD54 counteracts the positive role of Joka2-mediated selective autophagy in pathogen defense. 10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 030Figure 7. PexRD54 counteracts the enhanced resistance conferred by Joka2. ( A ) Overexpression of Joka2:RFP limits P. infestans colonization. Halves of N

. Thus P. infestans coopts the host cell’s endomembrane compartment to promote its own growth at the cost of the cell’s physiology ( Bozkurt et al., 2015 ). Joka2 could contribute to immunity by inducing autophagic removal of plant or pathogen molecules that negatively affect host defenses. It will be interesting in the future to determine the identity of potential defense-related cargo carried by Joka2 ( Figure 8 )

. Both Joka2 and the effector showed higher affinity to ATG8CL compared to ATG8IL ( Figure 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ). This indicates that variation between plant ATG8 proteins may contribute to the selective nature of autophagy. This work further highlights the intricate changes in endomembrane compartment formation that take place during plant-microbe interactions ( Bozkurt et al., 2015; Lipka and Panstruga, 2005; Kwon et al., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2010; Wang et al

. Stars indicate expected band sizes. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 021 The presence of a functional AIM in PexRD54 prompted us to hypothesize that this effector perturbs the autophagy cargo receptors of its host plants. Recently, Joka2 was reported as a selective autophagy cargo receptor of Solanaceous plants that also binds ATG8 via an AIM ( Svenning et al., 2011; Zientara-Rytter et al., 2011 ) ( Figure 6A )

. In plants, autophagy plays important roles in stress tolerance, senescence, development, and defense against invading pathogens ( Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008; Lenz et al., 2011; Vanhee and Batoko, 2011; Li and Vierstra, 2012; Lv et al., 2014; Teh and Hofius, 2014 ). Specifically, autophagy is implicated in the accumulation of defense hormones and the hypersensitive response, a form of plant cell death that prevents spread of microbial infection ( Yoshimoto et al., 2009 )

. Overexpression of Joka2, but not Joka2AIM, significantly restricted the size of the disease lesions caused by P. infestans ( Figure 7A–B ). Conversely, virus-induced gene silencing of Joka2 resulted in increased disease lesions ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ). This indicates that Joka2-mediated selective autophagy contributes to defense against this pathogen

. The potato blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, is a serious threat to food security, causing crop losses that, if alleviated, could feed hundreds of millions of people ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). This pathogen delivers RXLR-type effector proteins inside plant cells to enable parasitism ( Morgan and Kamoun, 2007 )

    Title: Human cardiac fibroblasts adaptive responses to controlled combined mechanical strain and oxygen changes in vitro
    Abstract: Upon cardiac pathological conditions such as ischemia, microenvironmental changes instruct a series of cellular responses that trigger cardiac fibroblasts-mediated tissue adaptation and inflammation. A comprehensive model of how early environmental changes may induce cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) pathological responses is far from being elucidated, partly due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation. Here, we provide a first analysis of human primary CF behavior by means of a multi-stimulus microdevice for combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension. Our findings elucidate differential human CFs responses to different combinations of the above stimuli. Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects ( PHH3+ mitotic cells, YAP translocation, PDGF secretion ) or increase collagen presence. Interestingly, only the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility ( 2% strain ) is able to additionally induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

    Supporting Text:
    In summary, we propose an innovative model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. Replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen changes and mechanical cues, we revealed how these environmental stimulations combine to trigger CF pathological responses and highlighted emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms

. In an attempt to provide in vitro models of cardiac disease, CFs have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress ( Schroer and Merryman, 2015; Tomasek et al., 2002 ), oxygen deprivation ( Clancy et al., 2007; Tamamori et al., 1997 ) and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Edgley et al., 2012; Lijnen et al., 2000; Petrov et al., 2002 )

. We here finely controlled the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by CFs to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury and provide insights into individual or synergistic contributions of the environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. Shortly after an ischemic myocardial insult ( e. g., acute coronary artery occlusion ) tissue oxygen levels drop from approximately 5–6% O2 ( Gonschior et al

. During the proliferative phase of myocardial healing, excessive CF proliferation is observed as well as a phenotypic switch giving rise to the fibrotic response. In order to understand how environmental stimuli modulate the proliferation of human CFs, we examined the fraction of mitotic cells ( PHH3+/DAPI ) under combined mechanical stimulation and changes in oxygen tension. Figure 2A shows representative images of CFs stained for PHH3 and DAPI

. We found that mimicking the combination of HX and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs, while individual environmental stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses. These insights have impact on future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model here described provides a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies.

. To date, no comprehensive model is able to recapitulate early cellular events taking place after acute myocardial injury and there is no report of cardiac cells subjected to simultaneous mechanical strain and controlled oxygen changes, two major environmental variables involved in cardiac injury and CF adaptive responses. This is mostly due to the lack of compact platforms enabling the controlled application of multiple stimuli

., 2009; Vartdal et al., 2007] ). Within this range and in line with previous in vitro observations of CFs behavior ( Ugolini et al., 2016 ), we selected 2% strain as indicative of reduced contractility and 8% strain as representative of full myocardial contractility. These environmental changes and the following initial cellular responses happen in a timeframe of hours, as shown in vitro ( van Nieuwenhoven et al., 2013; Turner et al

. The precise contribution of CFs in the regulation of the early inflammatory response in myocardial remodeling is still to be determined, however, recent reports suggest that CFs play a key role in modulating a functional inflammasome that includes inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Kawaguchi et al., 2011; Lindner et al., 2014; Turner, 2016 )

. We thus performed experiments lasting 24 hr and evaluated the main early aspects that govern fibrotic responses in the injured myocardium: ECM remodeling, with stainings for collagen I and quantifications of MMP expression; proliferation of CFs, with analyses of mitotic cells, Hippo pathway signaling and mitogenic PDGF ( platelet-derived growth factor ) expression; secretion of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in CF supernatants; myofibroblast differentiation, through stainings for

., 2014 ). In general, the onset of pathological myocardial conditions causes alterations of specific environmental cues at the cellular scale: mechanical strain decreases ( loss of contractility ) ; oxygen and nutrient levels dramatically decrease ( ischemia ) ; levels of inflammatory cytokines increase ( post-injury inflammatory response )

. 05 was considered significant. All data were collected from a pool of six independent experiments with a minimum number of biological replicates of four. We designed the approximate sample size required for the study by performing power analysis based on previously reported data on human cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) proliferative responses under mechanical strain ( Ugolini et al., 2016 )

. During post-injury myocardial remodeling, TGF-β is known to stimulate a wide range of CF responses from phenotypic switch to collagen synthesis and ECM remodeling ( Leask, 2007 ). CFs stimulated with a combination of HX and mechanical strain ( specifically 2% strain ) were found to increase secretion of TGF-β by approximately two-fold. CFs cultured at PX expressed lower amounts of TGF-β, regardless of the mechanical strain applied ( Figure 3A )

. IL1-β is one of the first cytokines detected in vivo after myocardial injury ( Guillén et al., 1995 ) and is known to stimulate CF response including the production of MMPs ( Brown et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Siwik et al., 2000 ). Interestingly, we found that a significant two-fold increase in IL1-β expression occurred only when CFs were subjected to the combination of HX and mechanical strain, particularly with 2% strain ( Figure 3B )

. Mechanical stimulation showed a negative interaction with the HX-induced secretion of PDGF: while levels of PDGF expression remain elevated under HX/2% strain, application of 8% cyclic strain shows a negative regulation of PDGF secretion back to PX levels of expression. Acute inflammatory tissue responses after myocardial injuries are thought to be largely based on cellular signaling by means of secreted factors

When supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium is critically reduced ( ischemia ), a complex tissue response takes place: within hours tissue necrosis and death of contractile cardiac myocytes occurs in the infarcted area giving rise to an inflammatory phase that recruits immune cells and activates quiescent cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) ; within a few days a proliferative phase begins, where activated CFs invade the infarcted area and contribute to degrading and replacing the

., 2014 ). Cellular and molecular events such as excessive proliferation of CFs, phenotypic switch of CFs, high levels of inflammatory cytokines and humoral factors, unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -mediated degradation of ECM are generally regarded as hallmarks of early fibrotic tissue response ( Fan et al., 2012; Krenning et al., 2010; Porter and Turner, 2009; Shinde and Frangogiannis, 2014 )

Myocardial pathological remodeling is largely based on unbalanced CF production of collagen I and MMP-mediated matrix remodeling. To analyze CF-mediated early remodeling events under combined stimulations, we analyzed immunofluorescence images of CFs stained for collagen I. In addition, we quantified the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in cell culture supernatants, two enzymes specifically expressed by CFs during cardiac remodeling ( Fan et al., 2012 )

. This essential process maintains tissue integrity, however, it often leads to excessive and adverse CFs remodeling of non-infarcted areas ( Fan et al., 2012; Kania et al., 2009; Talman and Ruskoaho, 2016 ) associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased mortality ( Okada et al., 2005 ). Controlled anti-fibrotic strategies still require deeper understanding and advanced models of cardiac fibrosis mechanisms ( Leask, 2010; Roubille et al., 2014 )

. This strain intensity-dependent effect is in line with our previous investigations of CF proliferation under mechanical strain in NX conditions ( Ugolini et al., 2016 ). After 12 hr of stimulation, the proliferative increase with HX is not statistically significant, while we report a significant synergistic decrease of mitotic cells induced by the combination of 8% strain and HX ( Figure 2B ). This is consistent with previous observations of CF behavior under mechanical and biochemical stimulation ( Edley et al,2012; Lnen et al,200; Petrov et,2002 )

    Title: Drosophila SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms
    Abstract: Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A. Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription. In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A. V ( the fly ortholog of H2A. Z ) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.

    Supporting Text:
   . The case of DOM illustrates beautifully how evolution can take different routes to achieve what must be assumed as an important functional specification ( Figure 4F, Supplementary file 3 ). In yeast, the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are entirely separate entities. In humans, whose genomes underwent duplication events, the paralogous SRCAP and EP400 protein ATPases each organize different complexes that may serve distinct, conserved functions

. This suggests that most of TIP60 resides in the DOM-A complex in Drosophila cells. The yeast SWR-1 and NuA4 complexes are both implicated in transcription ( Morillo-Huesca et al., 2010; Searle et al., 2017 ). We therefore explored the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription by RNAseq. In our analysis, we also included knock-downs of H2A. V and TIP60. Knock-down of either DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60 or H2A

. DOM-A also features similarly arranged domains, but they are separated by the long ATPase domain ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). This raises the question whether DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila. The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the well-studied yeast complex has not been reported so far. Since NuA4

., 2015 ). Surprisingly, our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A. C, a principle that might be conserved across metazoans. Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.

., 2019 ). H2A. Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to be important to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation ( Adam et al., 2001; Weber et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2014 ). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2A. Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1. C ), a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core ( Mizuguchi et al., 2004; Ranjan et al., 2013; Wang et al

. V global levels, just like DOM-B. In yeast SWR1. C and human SRCAP. C, the ARP6 orthologs are indispensable for nucleosome remodeling since they couple the ATPase motor to productive nucleosome sliding ( Matsuda et al., 2010; Willhoft et al., 2018; Willhoft and Wigley, 2020; Wu et al., 2005 ). The Drosophila DOM-B. C is likely to employ a similar remodeling mechanism. Knock-down of DOM-B affects transcription, but the effects overlap only partially with those that follow H2A

. On the other hand, we discovered that DOM-A. C is not involved in bulk H2A. V incorporation, despite the presence of an ATPase domain and many shared subunits with DOM-B. C. Rather, we realized that DOM-A. C might be the ‘missing’ acetyltransferase NuA4. C of D. melanogaster, which specifically targets lysine 12 of histone H4 ( H4K12 ), the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies ( Feller et al., 2015 )

., 2001 ). The first biochemical characterization revealed the presence of a multi-subunit complex composed of 15 proteins associated with the DOM ATPase ( Kusch et al., 2004 ). While many of the interactors identified are orthologous to the yeast SWR1. C subunits, additional interactors were found. Surprisingly, they showed similarity to components of a distinct yeast complex, the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 ( NuA4. C ) ( Kusch et al., 2004 ). NuA4

. Since NuA4. C is responsible for histone acetylation, we looked at H3 and H4 acetylation changes upon DOM isoform-specific knock-down by targeted mass-spectrometry. The hypothesis of a Drosophila NuA4. C poses the acetyltransferase TIP60 as the main effector of DOM-A. C. This is supported by the earlier finding that TIP60 is unstable in the absence of DOM-A ( Figure 2A ). We therefore included TIP60 knock-down for our targeted mass-spectrometry

. In yeast, inserting the ATPase domain of the Drosophila DOM between the HSA and SANT domains of EAF1, the central subunit of the yeast NuA4, does not affect its function ( Auger et al., 2008 ). Such a situation could also apply to DOM-A. Lastly, our mass-spectrometry analysis revealed new, uncharacterized interactors for DOM-A. Of those, the transcription factor CG12054 has been found as a potential DOM partner in a previous screen ( Rhee et al., 2014 )

., 2017 ), chemical modifications of histones create new interaction surfaces ( Bowman and Poirier, 2015; Zhao and Garcia, 2015 ) and histone variants furnish nucleosomes with special features ( Talbert and Henikoff, 2017 ). The very conserved H2A variant H2A. Z accounts for ~5–10% of the total H2A-type histone pool in vertebrates ( Redon et al., 2002; Thatcher and Gorovsky, 1994 ) and flies ( Bonnet et al., 2019 ). H2A

. In summary, we found that the depletion of the two DOM isoforms in cells caused specific transcriptional perturbations. The partially overlapping responses upon DOM-B and H2A. V depletions motivated a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between DOM-B and H2A. V levels in the genome. Both SWR1-type ATPases, DOM-A and DOM-B may contribute to H2A. V incorporation and turnover. We explored global changes in H2A

. C depends on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity, we employed the same RNAi-based complementation strategy we had used for DOM-B ( Figure 3D ). DOM-A was depleted and RNAi-resistant DOM-A wild-type or ATPase mutant derivatives were tested for their ability to rescue the loss of H4K12ac. As expected, the wild-type DOM-A transgene restored H4K12 acetylation ( Figure 4D ). Remarkably, this acetylation did not depend on a functional DOM-A ATPase

We discovered the existence of two separate, isoform-specific complexes with characteristic composition. Both are involved in transcription regulation, but through different mechanisms. On the one hand, we found that the DOM-B. C is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A. V, responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters

    Title: Slit2 as a β-catenin/Ctnnb1-dependent retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation
    Abstract: Neuromuscular junction formation requires proper interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. β-Catenin ( Ctnnb1 ) in muscle is critical for motoneuron differentiation; however, little is known about the relevant retrograde signal. In this paper, we dissected which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 are critical by an in vivo transgenic approach. We show that Ctnnb1 mutant without the transactivation domain was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of Ctnnb1 mutation, indicating the involvement of transcription regulation. On the other hand, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. We screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2. Transgenic expression of Slit2 specifically in the muscle was able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation.

   . Rescue experiments indicated a necessary role for the transcription activity of muscle Ctnnb1 in presynaptic differentiation. Our exploration of targets of Ctnnb1 as potential muscle-derived retrograde factors led to the identification of Slit2, an environmental cue that repels or collapses neuronal axons ( Brose et al., 1999; Kidd et al., 1999 )

. We showed that muscle overexpression of the Ctnnb1 mutant without the TAD was unable to rescue the presynaptic deficits of Ctnnb1 mutation, indicating that the transcription regulation is critical for muscle Ctnnb1 to control presynaptic differentiation. On the other hand, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. These results suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 is likely to regulate presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins

. In support of this notion are recent reports that expression of stable Ctnnb1 in muscle cells also impairs presynaptic differentiation in mutant mice ( Liu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012a ). These observations suggest that Ctnnb1 in muscle is critical for a retrograde pathway to direct nerve terminal development. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear

. We showed, first, that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene. Second, Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1. Slit2 was concentrated at the NMJ. Third, transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in the muscle were able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density and active zone, and depressed mEPP

., 2007 ). These observations raise questions whether the muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation via cell adhesion-dependent signaling and/or gene-expression. In this paper, we determined which function of Ctnnb1 is required for NMJ formation by characterizing transgenic mice expressing wild-type or Ctnnb1 mutants that were impaired in transcriptional regulation or cell-adhesion signaling

., 2012; Wu et al., 2012b ). Previously, we demonstrated that Ctnnb1 in muscle is critical for the differentiation of motor nerve terminals ( Li et al., 2008 ). In this paper, we dissected out which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 is critical by an in vivo transgenic approach

. Intriguingly, when Ctnnb1 is mutated in muscle fibers, mutant mice die neonatally, with profound presynaptic deficits such as mislocation of phrenic nerve primary branches, reduced synaptic vesicles, and impaired neuromuscular transmission ( Li et al., 2008 ), suggesting that Ctnnb1 in muscle cells is necessary for presynaptic differentiation

. Having demonstrated that Slit2 is a target of Ctnnb1-regulated transcription in muscles, we wanted to determine if overexpressing Slit2 in muscles was able to rescue presynaptic deficits in ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− mice. It should if the hypothesis is correct. To this end, we generated a transgenic mouse, ACTA1-Slit2, which expressed Flag-Slit2 under the control of the ACTA1 promoter ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B ). The ACTA1 promoter drives muscle-specific expression at embryonic day 9

. These observations demonstrate that Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by a transcription-dependent mechanism and identify Slit2 as a novel retrograde factor in NMJ formation.

. Finally, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce the synaptophysin puncta of axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. Slit2 is a member of the Slit family of secreted glycoproteins, which serve as repulsive cues for axons of various neurons ( Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2002; Shu et al., 2003; Marillat et al., 2004; Sabatier et al., 2004; Hussain et al

., 1999 ) and positively regulate motor axon fasciculation ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne, 2012 ). Slit2 was able to induce clusters of synaptophysin in cultured neurons, suggesting a synaptogenic function. Expression of Slit2 specifically in muscle fibers was able to rescue NMJ deficits in Ctnnb1-mutant mice

., 1999 ). Interestingly, mutation of Slit2, but not Slit1 or Slit3, disrupts motoneuron fasciculation and primary nerve location ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne, 2012 ), akin to NMJ morphological deficits of ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− mice. Of the three members of the Slit family, only Slit2 was down-regulated in ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− muscles ( Figure 4E ). The reduction was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− muscle homogenates ( Figure 5A, B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 07266

. This notion was supported by the observations that Ctnnb1 and Wnt signaling reporter were higher in synaptic nuclei at the NMJ than those in extra-synaptic areas. We reasoned that such a protein is secretable or has a transmembrane domain and its expression is down-regulated in Ctnnb1 mutant muscle. A screen for proteins that fulfill these criteria led to the identification of Slit2

. These results indicate that overexpressing Slit2 in muscles was sufficient to diminish presynaptic structural deficits that are caused by muscle Ctnnb1 deficiency, in agreement with the notion that Slit2 acts downstream of Ctnnb1. To test this hypothesis further, we characterized neuromuscular transmission of ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::ACTA1-Slit2 mice. Loss of Ctnnb1 in muscles resulted in reduced mEPP frequency but not amplitude ( Figure 7F–H ) ( Li et al., 2008 )

. These results do not support a possible involvement of these factors in muscle Ctnnb1 regulation of presynaptic differentiation. It is worthy pointing out that Slit2 overexpression in muscles has no effect on deficits involving primary and secondary branches. Therefore, presynaptic differentiation may be regulated by multiple factors derived from the skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that Wnt signaling regulates NMJ formation

. Similarly, active zones were fewer in ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− mice and ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1∆TAD mice, compared with control mice, ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1 mice, and ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA mice ( Figure 2A, C ). As reported previously ( Wu et al., 2012a ), Ctnnb1 mutation in muscles did not alter the number of terminals per NMJ and the width of synaptic clefts. Expression of Ctnnb1 wild type or mutants did not change these parameters ( Figure 2A, D, E )

. First, whole-mount staining of muscle fibers with Ctnnb1 antibody indicates that Ctnnb1 in synaptic nuclei appeared to be higher than that in extra-synaptic regions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ). Second, we characterized Axin2-nlacZ mice, where the nuclear-localized β-galactosidase ( nlacZ ) DNA was inserted in the Axin2 gene, a target of Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling

. These results are in agreement with the notion that muscle Ctnnb1 mainly regulates presynaptic differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 07266. 005Figure 2. Ctnb1 in muscle is required for presynaptic differentiation, but not cell adhesion. Ctn1−/− mice die neonatally with profound presaptic deficits such as mislocation phic nerve branches, reduced vesicles, and impaired neuus transmission ( Li et al. 2008 ), suggesting that Cnb in muscle is necessary for presyn differentiation. Ctn1−/−::LS-Ctn1TAD mice had similar presaptic deficits as C1−/− mice ( Figure 2A, C ), indicating that transcriptional regulation of C1 is required for presaptic differentiation. C1−/::LS-C1AA mice had normal presaptic ( Figure 2A, C ) suggesting that cell-adhesion of C1 is dispensable. C−/−::LS-C1T mice had similar presaptic as C−/− ( Figure 2, C ) indicating that transcriptional regulation of C is required for presaptic. C−/−LS-C mice had normal presaptic ( Figure 2, C ) suggesting cell-adhesion of C is dispensable. C−/−LS-C mice had similar presaptic as−− ( Figure 2, C ) indicating transcriptional regulation of C is required for presaptic.−/−LS mice had normal presaptic ( Figure 2, ) cell-adhesion of C is dispensable.−−LS mice had similar presaptic as− ( Figure 2 C ) indicating transcriptional regulation C is required for presaptic.−−− mice had presaptic normal ( Figure 2 ) cell-adhesion C is dispensable−− mice had pres similaraptic as− ( Figure 2 C ) indicating transcriptional regulation C is required for presaptic−−− had presaptic normal ( Figure 2 ) cell-adhesion C is dispensable−−− had pres similaraptic as− ( Figure 2 ) indicating transcriptional C is required for pres−−− presaptic normal ( Figure 2 ) cell-ad C is dispensable−−− had pres similar as− ( Figure 2 ) indicating transcription regulation is for pres−−− presaptic ( Figure 2 ) cell C is dispensable−−− had similar as− ( Figure 2 ) indicating regulation for pres−−− pres (2 ) cell C is dispensable−−− had as− (2 ) regulation for− pres− ( ) C is dispensable−− had− as− ( ) regulation− for− pres− ( ) is dispensable−−− as− ( ) regulation−− for− pres− ( ) is−−− as− ( )−−− for− ( )−−−−− (− )−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−

    Title: Mapping the dynamics of force transduction at cell–cell junctions of epithelial clusters
    Abstract: Force transduction at cell-cell adhesions regulates tissue development, maintenance and adaptation. We developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify, with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution, the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters. Applying this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters, we found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster, and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues, and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions.

    Using our generalized cell–cell force measurement and analysis method, we quantified, spatially and temporally, the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters

. Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell–cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time, both during interphase and cell divisions. We thus investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell–cell junctions. We focused first on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells

. Along the cell junction, we showed with sub-interface resolution that the local mechanical stresses also correlated with localization of E-cadherin molecules. Expanding our approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell, we found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction

. Our method also provides insights into tissue mechanics by revealing that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter, due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell–matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility ( Figure 9 ). The longer-range force transmission previously observed and required for tissue morphogenesis processes, such as collective cell migration ( Tambe et al

. In our experiments, the curvilinear sections were defined by the fluorescence signals of GFP fused to E-cadherin, the molecular backbone of adherens junctions in epithelial tissues ( Halbleib and Nelson, 2006 ). Thus we could calculate force exchange profiles along cell–cell interfaces ( Figure 3A ) at any time point of a time-lapse video ( Video 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 03282. 005Figure 3. Quantification of cell–cell force exchange in a 3-cell cluster with changing topology

Tissues undergo continuous rearrangements that require tightly balanced exchanges of mechanical forces between individual cells through cadherin-mediated cell–cell junctions. The importance of mechanical coupling between cells has been documented for diverse multi-cellular processes, including tissue morphogenesis during development ( Mammoto and Ingber, 2010; Martin et al., 2010; Rauzi et al., 2010; Lecuit et al., 2011; Weber et al

., 2012 ). Understanding how microenvironmental mechanical properties influence force transduction in epithelial cell groups may have implications not only for developmental processes but also for pathologies such as cancer where matrix stiffness is often altered ( Paszek et al., 2005 ). Lastly, our cell–cell force microscopy method allowed us to correlate, in quantitative terms, cell–cell force transmission to intracellular molecular dynamics

. Combined with image analyses of cell–cell junction configurations and rearrangements in the living cell clusters, our data provided unprecedented statistical power and time resolution to address questions regarding force distributions and fluctuations within cell clusters, as well as their coupling to the recruitment of molecular components of adherens junctions ( Maruthamuthu et al., 2011 )

. We developed a method that utilizes high-resolution traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and time-lapse live cell microscopy to quantify cell–cell mechanical interactions in dynamic multi-cellular clusters, while maintaining the sub-cellular resolution needed to measure force exchange at the level of individual junctions

. These results support the model that the junctional recruitment of E-cadherin is coupled to the cell–cell adhesion forces ( Liu et al., 2010; Borghi et al., 2012 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 03282. 013Figure 5. Correlation of calculated cell–cell forces with E-cadherin-GFP junctional localization

. In this model, each individual cell in a cell cluster, though linked with one another, functions independently with the ability to promote or attenuate force transduction. There are two non-exclusive mechanisms that could attenuate force transduction across individual cells: first, forces at cell–cell junctions may be transmitted to the substrate via cell–matrix adhesions, thus intercepting the mechanical link between opposing cell–cell junctions ( ‘force anchoring mechanism’ )

.

( C ) Segmentation of cells in the cluster, overlaid on the traction force field ( small colored vectors ) and an inverted fluorescence image of the cell cluster. Longer vectors in cell centers indicate residual traction forces for individual cells

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03282. 009 We first applied our generalized method to study the dynamics and patterns of cell–cell adhesion forces in naturally formed clusters of MCF10A epithelial cells in 2D adherent cultures, including clusters that were undergoing cell divisions ( Figure 4A–C; Video 4 ). Cell proliferation is an important factor in regulating the tensional homeostasis of tissues ( Farhadifar et al., 2007; Ranft et al., 2010; Eisenhoffer et al

. Based on our statistical analysis of over 90 cell clusters and over 250 cell–cell junctions in these clusters, it appeared that intercellular force transmission exhibits distinct spatial patterns in clusters cultured on soft vs stiff substrates, in which cell–cell forces are transmitted along cluster peripheral cells on stiff substrates, but through the cluster center on soft substrates ( Figure 7 )

. The notion of active propagation of mechanical forces across tissues via spatial gradients in myosin-II activation is supported by studies of epithelial sheet migration ( Ng et al., 2012 ) and collective invasion of cancer cell clusters ( Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011 ), in which an asymmetric distribution of actomyosin contractility promote cell cohesion

., 2008 ), and cell sorting ( Landsberg et al., 2009 ), not only with putative surrogates of force generation ( e. g., myosin-II localization ) but also with actual force values. We show that mechanical forces may be balanced during major topology-changing events such as cell division by dynamic redistribution of cell–cell junctional forces within small cell clusters ( Figure 4 )

. These tests confirmed that despite the simple thin-plate model, cell–cell forces are resolved at the length scale E-cadherin-GFP intensities that fluctuate along the cell junction ( Figure 6 ). We therefore conclude that the model simplifications are in this case not severe enough to obscure spatial relationships between force and underlying molecular processes in cell junctions. Second, our method relies on E-cadherin-GFP signals for determining the location of cell–cell junctions

., 2011, 2013; Hur et al., 2012 ). Using this assay, we quantitatively mapped the forces transmitted through individual cell–cell junctions of dynamic MCF10A epithelial cell clusters of various sizes and configurations over time. Our results revealed that the spatial distributions and dynamics of basal cell–cell force transmission correlated with morphogenetic events such as cell divisions

. These data showed that the decoupling from the matrix of a cell within a cluster promotes the transmission of forces across the cell, from one cell–cell junction to the next, in support of the force anchoring mechanism as one way a cell may attenuate long-range force transmission. 10. 7554/eLife. 03282. 021Video 5.

. Although it is yet unclear how substrate stiffness precisely regulates cell–matrix adhesions, the cytoskeletal network, and traction force exertion in cell clusters, it has been shown that the differences induced by substrate stiffness can extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet ( Ng et al., 2012 )

 Researchers have developed a new method to study the dynamics of force transmission at cell-cell junctions in epithelial clusters.

The study found that basal fluctuations in force were coupled to E-cadher localization at the level of individual-cell junctions. At the multi-cell scale, cell force depended on the position within a cluster and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, transmission through a cell required modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomy contractility in the cell and its neighbors.

They investigated how basal variations were coupled to localization of the components of cell junction. Focused on Eadher, the backbone of adherens junction epithelial cells. Along the junction, mechanical stresses correlated with localization of Ead molecules. Expanding to force fluctuation at the scale of cell, found that propagation can be intercepted by anchorage to the extracellular and actomy contraction.

The method provides insights into tissue mechanics that transmission across a cluster is short-ranged, on the scale of cell diameter due to anchoring and scrambling forces by cell-matrix adhes and actomy contractility. Longer-range transmission observed required for tissue processes such as collective migration and morphogenesis. The study showed that decoupling from matrix a within a cluster promotes transmission across cell from junction to next, supporting the anchoring as a way to attenuate long-range transmission.

    Title: Huntingtin’s spherical solenoid structure enables polyglutamine tract-dependent modulation of its structure and function
    Abstract: The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin protein causes Huntington’s disease. Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease.

    Supporting Text:
   . In order to solve the apparent puzzle of how huntingtin’s solenoid structure may enable quantitative or qualitative ( or both ) modulation of huntingtin function, according to the size of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract, we have extended initial observations showing a likely flexible α-helical structure by conducting systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of members of a panel of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins, with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts (

., 1999 ). The impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin basic structural features strongly suggests that it is possible that huntingtin may also undergo dramatic conformational change upon interaction with its binding partners

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11184. 004 We then investigated the proposal that huntingtin’s shape may enable a structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract, by performing single-particle electron microscopy ( EM ) of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues. These were purified to high homogeneity using a gradient purification method with mild crosslinking ( GraFix ) ( Kastner et al

. Our biophysical analyses of an allelic series of native recombinant human huntingtins now provide a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may be in a position to modulate huntingtin structure and function

. ( D ) An average ( MRE ) in units of deg. cm2/dmol, at 222 nm wavelength characteristic of an α-helix ), from two independent experiments, was plotted against the length of the polyglutamine tract of huntingtin proteins ( bars represent mean ± SEM ). Temperature was 25°C. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11184. 00310. 7554/eLife. 11184. 004Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Normalization of purified huntingtin proteins with varied polyglutamine tract length

. The success of our structural analysis using an allelic series of huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths suggests that this approach applied to high-resolution analyses will continue to yield insights into the huntingtin disease trigger-mechanism.

., 2015; Li et al., 2006 ). To carry out a standardized evaluation, we performed circular dichroism ( CD ) analysis of a series of recombinant human huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths ( Q2-, Q23-, Q46-, Q67-, Q78-huntingtin, respectively ) purified to homogeneity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). The CD spectra ( Figure 1B ) of all of the huntingtins are consistent with a predominant α-helical secondary structure ( Liu and Rost, 2003; Rost et al

Huntingtin is the entire large protein product ( >350 kDa MW ) of the Huntingtin gene ( HTT previously HD ). Huntingtin has a segment of polyglutamine near its amino terminus ( Amino-terminal ) that is encoded by a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat. If expanded above 38-residues, this mutation causes Huntington’s disease ( HD ), a dominant neurodegenerative disorder ( Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993 )

. Our biophysical analyses also provide basic insights for future higher-resolution studies that will be needed to more precisely delineate huntingtin structure and its modulation by the polyglutamine tract. The DSS-XL-MS intramolecular cross-linking data, together with our previously reported limited proteolysis analysis ( Seong et al., 2010 ) provide a general sense of how rod-like α-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domains, may fold to delimit the closed shape that we observe

., 2006 ) ; the proteolytically cleaved amino-terminal fragment interacted with the carboxyl-terminal fragment of huntingtin ( El-Daher et al., 2015 ) ; the proximity between the first 17 residues and the polyproline region has been shown to change by the polyglutamine tract size both in exon 1 fragment and endogenous full-length huntingtin ( Caron et al., 2013 )

. Plotting an average of the Mean Residue Ellipticity ( MRE ) at 222 nm ( characteristic of an α-helix ) reveals an incremental quantitative effect of lengthening the polyglutamine tract at the amino terminus on the α-helicity of the entire molecule ( Figure 1D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 11184. 003Figure 1. Huntingtin secondary structure is modulated by the length of polyglutamine tract

. While Q23- and Q78-huntingtin show unique crosslinks skewed toward either amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal region respectively, the wide-spread intramolecular interactions of Q46-huntingtin prompt us to hypothesize that the polyglutamine tract expansion induces subtle but progressive structural changes in huntingtin

. Consistent with our data, particularly including long-range interaction affected by the polyglutamine expansion, a few studies previously implied and reported the global structural and functional influence by the polyglutamine tract size: the interaction with HAP40 at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of huntingtin was influenced by the polyglutamine expansion ( Pal et al

. These observations strongly imply that the extreme N-terminus, and by inference the adjacent polyglutamine tract, is folded back, forming a spherically shaped solenoid with an internal cavity, but is accessible at the outside surface, regardless of its length. 10. 7554/eLife. 11184. 011Figure 3. Detection of the amino-terminus region of huntingtin by electron microscopy

. Nevertheless this shape must enable modulation by the amino-terminal polyglutamine segment. It seems reasonable that this may involve some structural feature that is critical to huntingtin function. One possibility is structure-dependent post-translational modification. Human huntingtin is phosphorylated, at more than seventy modified serine, threonine and tyrosine residues ( Hornbeck et al., 2012 )

. Thus, folding of the two main HEAT/HEAT-like domains forms an extensive internal cavity consistent with the shape that we observe in EM analysis, while providing an elegant explanation for the conundrum of how the polyglutamine tract located at the end of the amino-terminal arm may affect change throughout the entire protein. All of the huntingtins, regardless of polyglutamine tract length, appear to have the same basic core structure

It has been reported previously that purified huntingtin exhibits a predominantly α-helical secondary structure but among studies the impact of polyglutamine size has been inconsistent ( Fodale et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2006 )

We applied a systematic structure-function approach to delineate the features of huntingtin that conspire with its polyglutamine tract to comprise, in conjunction with some as yet unknown target, the dominant gain of function mechanism that triggers the pathogenic process in patients with HD

. In all three huntingtins ( all red dashed arrows ), NTD-I folds to contact CTD-I and CTD-II also contacts CTD-I as well as NTD-II, implying that the physical impact of the polyglutamine tract at the very amino-terminal end has the opportunity to subtly but globally alter the entire huntingtin structure and function in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner.

. These proteins were used throughout the study.

    Title: Ferritinophagy via NCOA4 is required for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron dependent HERC2-mediated proteolysis
    Abstract: NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process critical for regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Moreover, NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting.

   ., 2014 ) ; when iron levels are high, NCOA4 abundance is low, thereby promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture. But when iron is low, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes is limited and is complicated by the fact that the pool of NCOA4 participating in targeting ferritin to autophagosomes is apparently degraded within lysosomes

. We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy. We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its ‘CUL7-homology domain’ to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture

., 2014 ), a key iron-sensing protein that promotes turnover of the ferritin translational repressor IRP2 ( Iron Regulatory Protein 2, also known as IREB2 ) when iron is high ( Salahudeen et al., 2009; Vashisht et al., 2009 ). However, the precise role that HERC2, iron, and the ubiquitin system play in regulating NCOA4, and how this is related to NCOA4 autophagic turnover during ferritinophagy remains unexplored

., 2014 ). We further showed that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. NCOA4 was subsequently identified as an ubiquitylation target when the VPS34 autophagy activator is inhibited and also was found to promote ferritinophagy ( Dowdle et al., 2014 ). Three central questions emerge from this work

., 2014 ). Since aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes would be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high, we next sought to elucidate the mechanism whereby cells suppress NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy under iron-replete conditions

. Ferritin is degraded in the lysosome and recent evidence implicated autophagy, a conserved catabolic cellular pathway, in the ‘ferritinophagy’ process ( Radisky and Kaplan, 1998; Asano et al., 2011 ). Through quantitative proteomic analysis of purified autophagosomes, we recently identified NCOA4 as the selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome, providing the first mechanistic explanation of how ferritinophagy occurs ( Mancias et al., 2014 )

. At later stages when iron is required for heme biosynthesis, NCOA4 could then more efficiently and with better kinetics target for degradation ferritin complexes with this higher FTH1-FTL ratio. The modulation of NCOA4 transcript levels during erythroid differentiation suggests an additional layer of regulation of NCOA4 at the transcriptional level that we do not yet understand beyond the post-translational roles of HERC2 and autophagy. The recent results from Dowdle et al

. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that control NCOA4 abundance could help unravel the physiological underpinnings of flux through the ferritinophagy pathway, with implications for understanding iron utilization. Our recent work revealed HERC2, a large multi-domain homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus ( HECT ) E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an NCOA4-interacting protein ( Mancias et al., 2014 )

. We determined that in addition to HERC2-dependent turnover, NCOA4 also undergoes turnover via basal autophagy. Under iron deficient conditions, despite continued autophagic turnover, the apparent lack of HERC2 action on NCOA4 leads to a net increase in NCOA4 protein level thereby promoting ferritinophagy to release iron from ferritin for use by the cell

. This may be due to an over-abundance of ferritin complexes chelating free iron ( as suggested by a rise in IRP2 levels, Figure 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) ; however, as re-expression of FTH1R23A in FTH1-null cells leads to only a modest increase in NCOA4 there is likely some ability of ferritin complexes to sequester NCOA4 from degradation via HERC2 and even autophagy. A model that depicts multiple modes of regulation of NCOA4 is provided in Figure 6

. Surprisingly, we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding, suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover. Finally, we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis

. When iron is available, the iron bound pool of NCOA4 can be targeted for ubiquitylation by HERC2, leading to NCOA4 turnover through the proteasome. When iron levels are low, such as modeled here by chelation, a pool of NCOA4 is liberated from the grasp of HERC2 and may then participate in trafficking of ferritin to the lysosome. Inappropriate depletion or accumulation of FTH1 may also provide insight into the dynamics of NCOA4 turnover

., 2015 ). There is evidence that transferrin-liberated endosomal iron is transferred directly to mitochondria ( Sheftel et al., 2007 ) ; however, additional studies show that ferritin-sequestered iron is also utilized for heme synthesis ( Vaisman et al., 1997 ). Here, we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies, as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4, Ferritin, and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis

. In most cell types, ferritin complexes are composed of both heavy and light chains. The identification of point mutants that specifically abolish these interactions could facilitate a further dissection of NCOA4 function. Second, given that NCOA4 levels appear to control flux through the ferritinophagy pathway, what mechanisms control the abundance of NCOA4? We previously reported that NCOA4 levels are altered by intracellular iron status ( Mancias et al

. The structural determinants of NCOA4 iron binding and how iron is loaded onto NCOA4 have yet to be determined but we do note the presence of multiple conserved cysteine residues throughout NCOA4 that may play a role in iron binding. 10. 7554/eLife. 10308. 012Figure 6. Iron Levels Regulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. A model of NCOA4 ferritinophagy regulation ( see the text for details ). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10308

. These data indicate that NCOA4 levels are under the control of dual autophagic and proteasomal systems, and both are operative in the setting of intermediate iron levels as observed under typical cell culture conditions. Turnover through autophagy could be linked specifically to its capture during the process of ferritinophagy, although we cannot rule out the possibility that NCOA4 also has additional cargo that may also contribute to its flux through the autophagy system

. The dark brown coloration of NCOA4 shRNA pellets suggests accumulation of iron-laden ferritin with inability to release iron for subsequent heme synthesis ( Figure 5D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10308. 011Figure 5.

Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) and its role in higher-level cognition. They proposed that the LP is organized hierarchically, with rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information and facilitating flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Human fMRI data revealed rostral/caud gradients of abstraction in the LP, and dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical LP interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus affer connections positioned midLP as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP, consistent with a role in integrating information control. Strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability. Results suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with midLP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.

The study confirmed the rostral/caud axis of LP operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus-domain specificity and control. Interactions among LP sub-regions showed cognitive demands elicited asymmetrical influences of hierarchical processing. Hierarchical orientation of midLP in connectivity and top-down from rostral to midLP during control were positively related to higher-level ability. The organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity. Data suggest top-down within LP is important for higher-level function, and strongly asymmetrical projections from mid to LP were related to higher ability, suggesting a beneficial hierarchy with midLP at apex.

The LP was examined by varying demands on domain and control. Collectively, these engaged LP providing a comprehensive account of function. Progressively rostral areas processed abstract levels of control with Temporal, Contextual, and Control eliciting rostral activations. Dynamic modeling showed hierarchical asymmetries strongest in midLP. Cognitive demands elicited top-down from rostral to mid and bottom-up from caud to mid. Analyses of connectivity and modulations suggest midLP forms a nexus where information converges to action.

The rostral/caud LP axis is sensitive to abstraction, with caud showing concrete and rostral abstract properties. The question remains how these interact to support goal-directed cognition and whether interactions are hierarchical. Understanding hierarchical in LP is a barrier to modeling goal-directed cognition. A paradigm was devised to engage LP by orthogonally manipulating demands on domain and control. Support for rostral-caud LP comes from changes in connectivity by cognitive demands. A study demonstrated a cascade of activations across LP, with temporally remote control showing rostral activation.

Hierarchical confers substantial efficiency and flexibility, and processing in LP could explain higher cognition in primates. However, data demonstrating hierarchical in LP have been limited and controversial. The study examined abstract versus concrete through stimulus-domain specificity. Activation of LP showed distinct peaks spanning rostral, mid, and caud areas. Effective connectivity was examined as LP engaged by demands. Influences did not follow rostral-caud progression, while control modulated from rostral mid and domain from caud to mid.

The LP is central to higher cognition, damage produces deficits, and neuroimaging demonstrated involvement across tasks. Despite influence, mechanistic insight has remained. Differentiating sensitivities of LP subions is a step, mechanistic insight requires intercommunication among LPions. The LP is proposed hierically, with rostral exerting greater influence caud. A study examined interactions within LP by demands on domain and control. Collectively engaged LP a comprehensive function. Progressively rostral processed abstract levels with Temp, Contextual, and Control eliciting rostral activations. Dynamic showed hierarchical strongest in mid. Cognitive demands elicited top-down rostral and bottom-up caud. Analyses suggest mid forms a nexus where information converges action.

The rostral-caud axis is sensitive to abstraction, with caud concrete and rostral properties. The remains how interact to support goal-directed and whether interactions are hierarchical. Understanding in LP is a barrier to goal-directed cognition. A paradigm was devised to engage LP by demands on domain and control. Support rostral-caud

    Title: The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 promotes generation of basal neural progenitors and induces cortical folding in mice
    Abstract: Cortical expansion and folding are often linked to the evolution of higher intelligence, but molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells ( vRGs ) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia ( oRG ), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.

    In this study, we found a remarkable effect of the hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 in promoting the generation of oRG cells in mice with a high proliferative ability previously observed in primates. Importantly, this oRG generation is accompanied by the appearance of cortical folding

. Recently, a human-specific gene ARHGAP11B has been shown to promote production of basal IPs and cause cortical folding in the electroporated mouse brain ( Florio et al., 2015 ). We propose that TBC1D3, which appeared earlier than ARHGAP11B during human evolution ( Florio et al., 2015; Hodzic et al., 2006; Perry et al., 2008 ), acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding

. This study provides proof-of-concept that the brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution.

. 5 showed apparent folding of the cortex at regions containing electroporated cells when observed three days postnatal ( P3 ) ( Figure 5A ). At P7, the cortical folding was more pronounced ( Figure 5A ), suggesting a cumulative effect of TBC1D3 on the formation of gyrus-like cortical folding in mice

. Because delamination and elevation of the proliferative capacity of BPs are both required to account for the observed TBC1D3-induced oRG generation and cortical folding, we further examined the effect of TBC1D3 expression on the intrinsic stemness signaling pathways in BPs. Interestingly, we found that TBC1D3 expression in neuroprogenitors by in utero electroporation at E13. 5 caused a reduced expression of Trnp1 in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15

., 2015 ). Since cortical folding emerges progressively during primate evolution, multiple primate- and hominid-specific genes are likely to be involved in the emergence of cortical folding. Gene duplication may play critical roles in brain evolution ( Geschwind and Rakic, 2013 ). In particular, duplication of specific genes in humans may be responsible for the marked increase in cortical folding

. TBC1D3 expression causes delamination of vRG cells, through down-regulating the level of N-cadherin and Trnp1, and promotes proliferation of oRG-like cells by regulating cell stemness pathways, including Ras/ERK signaling. The increased generation of the oRG-like cells, the IP cells, and subsequently regional increase in the density of new born neurons, induces cortical folding in mice. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18197. 026

. 5 mice ( electroporated at E13. 5 ) showed that delaminated TBC1D3-expressing cells often exhibited clustered distribution by forming vertical column-like structures ( Figure 1E ), reminiscent of ontogenic radial units ( Rakic, 1988 ), expansion of which has been proposed to underlie cortical folding ( Borrell and Gotz, 2014; Florio and Huttner, 2014; Lui et al., 2011; Rakic, 1988 )

. Immunofluorescence staining of cortical sections obtained from GW18 human specimens during the peak period of neurogenesis revealed high TBC1D3 expression near the ventricular surface and in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) ( Figure 1B ), suggesting a role of TBC1D3 in cortex development. 10. 7554/eLife. 18197. 003Figure 1. TBC1D3 expression in developing mice cortex disrupts adherens junctions and induces formation of column-like structures

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18197. 016 Although the cortex of small rodents is lissencephalic, it has the potential of forming fissures and folds, as shown in recent studies using regional down-regulation of a DNA-associated protein Trnp1 ( Stahl et al., 2013 ) or exogenous application of FGF2 protein in early mouse embryos ( Rash et al., 2013 ). We found that about one third of mice electroporated with the TBC1D3 construct in neuroprogenitors at E13

. We found TBC1D3 expression markedly elevated the generation and proliferation of BPs and resulted in extensive cortex folding in the mouse brain, and further delineated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its action. Furthermore, TBC1D3 is essential for the generation of BPs in cultured developing human brain slices. The transgenic mice generated in this study may provide a feasible model to link cortical folding to higher brain functions.

., 2011; Rakic, 1988 ). This column-like aggregation of basal cells induced by TBC1D3 expression may result from increased number of proliferating cells originated from VZ ( see below ), and leads to lateral heterogeneity in the rate of neuronal production that may contribute to cortical folding. Previous studies have shown that disruption of AJs due to the loss of RhoA in neural progenitors is accompanied by an elevated proliferation of neuroprogenitors ( Katayama et al., 2011 )

. Multiple genes underlying different or shared cellular processes associated with neurogenesis may all contribute in part to the formation of cortical folding and gyrification found in primates. Thus, it would be of great interest to elucidate gene expression networks related with TBC1D3 expression. Identification of the ‘hub’ genes of such networks may further clarify the role of TBC1D3 in the cytoarchitectural development on the cortex

., 2013; Hansen et al., 2010; Reillo et al., 2011; Shitamukai et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011 ). In the present study, we showed that increased population of oRG in mice is accompanied with cortical fold formation, supporting the critical role of highly proliferative oRG in cortical expansion and gyrification in primates. It is postulated that oRG cells are derived from the ventricular RGs, presumably requiring delamination from apical anchoring ( Borrell and Gotz, 2014 )

. However, amplification of VZ progenitors via overexpression of β-catenin in the mouse brain led to the folding of the ventricular rather than cortical surface ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ), and amplification of IPs only increased the brain size without inducing cortical folding in mice ( Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013 ). Recent studies have established the association between the relative abundance of oRG and the degree of cortical folding in various species ( Betizeau et al

. The notable slight decrease of EGFP- apical neural progenitors might be due to the disruption of proliferation niche in VZ regions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, D, left ). 10. 7554/eLife. 18197. 006Figure 2.

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18197. 015 To further determine whether TBC1D3 is really essential for the generation of oRG cells in the developing human brain, we took advantage of small interference RNA ( siRNA ) and investigated the effect of TBC1D3 down-regulation on basal cortical neural progenitors of human brain slices ( Figure 4A–F )

. These results suggest that TBC1D3-induced cortical expansion is mainly due to increased number of neurons rather than astrocytes. Although cortical folding was enriched in motor cortex, we also observed a mild increase in the density of Cux1+ in sensory cortex, which formed much less folds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 4 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3G, H )

    Title: Dynamic ubiquitination determines transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1
    Abstract: Activation of systemic acquired resistance in plants is associated with transcriptome reprogramming induced by the unstable coactivator NPR1. Immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 are thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, thereby maximising gene expression. Because of this potentially costly sacrificial process, we investigated if ubiquitination of NPR1 plays transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover. Here we show ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase, UBE4, it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity. Thus, immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover.

    Supporting Text:
   . Thus, loss of UBE4 largely uncoupled NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity, demonstrating the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity. In summary, our findings indicate that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome

. Instead, initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, at least in part by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially also by promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term ( Figure 3 ). Although it remains unclear if CRL3 adds only monoubiquitin or generates short chains shy of tetraubiquitin, the minimal signal required for proteasome recognition ( Thrower et al

To examine if stepwise ubiquitination of NPR1 plays a role in plant immune responses we examined a potential role for E4 ligases. Unlike E3 ligases, the E4 class do not contribute towards initial ubiquitination of substrates but rather extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains ( Hoppe, 2005; Koegl et al., 1999 ). In Arabidopsis the E4 ligase UBE4/MUSE3 has been implicated in the degradation of NLR ( nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat ) immune receptors

. Therefore we explored the alternative possibility that prior to degradation, ubiquitination itself might act as a transcriptional signal. As chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules are thought to be necessary for recruitment of most substrates to the proteasome ( Thrower et al., 2000 ), it is plausible that processive ubiquitination could provide a window of opportunity for NPR1 to activate its target genes

. Our study on the immune coactivator NPR1, however, indicates that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover. We discovered that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise event, requiring the actions of CRL3 and the E4 ligase UBE4. In resting cells, CRL3-mediated turnover of NPR1 is important for preventing autoimmunity in absence of pathogen threat ( Spoel et al

. Such activity places this DUB in direct opposition to UBE4-mediated chain extension activity. In yeast Ubp6 was previously reported to oppose ubiquitin chain extension activity of the E4 ligase Hul5, thereby regulating substrate recruitment to the proteasome ( Crosas et al., 2006 ). Similarly, Arabidopsis UBP6 and UBP7 opposed ubiquitin ligase activities to extend the lifetime of transcriptionally active NPR1

. Accordingly, expression of FLAG-tagged UBP6 in the ubp6/7 mutant background restored NPR1 stability ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ). These results demonstrate that UBP6 and UBP7 serve to stabilise NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains that signal for its proteasome-mediated degradation. Given the importance of progressive ubiquitination for the transcriptional activity of NPR1, we explored how UBP6- and UBP7-mediated deubiquitination might affect NPR1 coactivator function

. In presence of SA, however, CRL3-mediated ubiquitination induced NPR1 coactivator activity, whereas formation of polyubiquitin chains by UBE4 blocked its activity and ultimately led to proteasome-mediated turnover ( Figures 2 and 3 ). Rather than initiating substrate ubiquitination, E4 ligases are thought to extend existing ubiquitin chains ( Crosas et al., 2006; Koegl et al

. In this study we demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of NPR1 is controlled by several ubiquitin chain modifying enzymes. Both stepwise ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities contribute to the regulation of NPR1 target genes and establishment of plant immunity

. We demonstrate that the opposing actions of an E3 and E4 ligase pair and two DUBs can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of the unstable immune coactivator NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover. Dynamicity in conjugated ubiquitin chain length may be a powerful mechanism for controlling the activity of unstable eukaryotic ( co ) activators in general.

. Compared to WT plants, SA-induced NPR1 accumulated to elevated levels in both cul3a/b and ube4 mutants ( Figure 3E ). Thus, NPR1 protein levels cannot explain differences in transcriptional output of NPR1. We then examined if changes in polyubiquitin chain length regulate NPR1 association with its target promoters

. We then examined if in ube4 mutants NPR1 lingered in a highly transcriptional active state that does not require proteasome-mediated turnover. To negate any feedback effects of loss of UBE4 activity on endogenous NPR1 expression, seedlings constitutively expressing NPR1-GFP were treated with SA plus a range of MG132 concentrations

. Arabidopsis UBE4/MUSE3 works in concert with a CRL1/SCFCPR1 ligase to regulate stability of the intercellular immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2 that recognise pathogen invasion ( Cheng et al., 2011; Gou et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014 ). Taken together with our finding that UBE4 acts in concert with CRL3 ( Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), this suggests a single E4 enzyme may assist in diverse ubiquitin-mediated pathways controlled by different E3 ligases

. Trimming or removal of ubiquitin chains is performed by deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) and may provide another layer of regulation of NPR1 activity. The Arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode for at least 65 DUBs ( Vierstra, 2009; Yang et al., 2007 ) with high likelihood of redundancy among gene families. Therefore identifying candidate genes that potentially regulate NPR1 by genetically screening mutant collections was not feasible

. By contrast, SA-regulated genes that were not dependent on NPR1 behaved similarly in WT and mutant ube4 plants ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ), suggesting UBE4 exerts its effects predominantly through NPR1. Together these data suggest that in absence of UBE4-mediated long-chain polyubiquitination, NPR1 remains in a highly active transcriptional state. To understand the opposing effects of CRL3 and UBE4 on transcriptional activity of NPR1, we examined endogenous NPR1 protein levels

. Because ube4 mutant phenotypes resemble those of mutants in CRL3 ligase ( Spoel et al., 2009 ), we investigated if UBE4 also controls NPR1 stability in the nucleus. Expression of a YFP-UBE4 fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts confirmed it is indeed partly localised to the nucleus ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ). We used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to examine if UBE4 controls the stability of SA-induced NPR1

The ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system plays vital roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression, in large part by controlling the abundance of transcriptional regulators. Paradoxically, proteasome-dependent instability of selected potent eukaryotic transcriptional activators is necessary for the expression of their target genes

. Mutant ube4/muse3 plants exhibited enhanced disease resistance but this phenotype could only be explained in part by the increased stability of an NLR receptor ( Huang et al., 2014 ). Therefore we investigated if UBE4 is involved in downstream NPR1-dependent immune signalling by acquiring a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Like mutants in CRL3 ligase that fail to degrade NPR1 ( Spoel et al

. This suggests that UBP6 and UBP7 prevent the build-up of long polyubiquitin chains that block the transcriptional activity of NPR1. It also implies that similar to their yeast homologue, UBP6 and UBP7 exhibit proteasome-associated deubiquitinase activity ( Cros et al. 2006 ). In Arabidopsis UBP and U7 stabilise NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains that signal its proteome-mediated degradation ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). Given the importance of progressive ubiquit for transcriptional activity of NPR, we explored UBP- and U7-mediated deubitination on NPR coactiv function. In the presence of SA, C3-mediated ubiquit induced NPR coactiv activity, whereas formation of polyubitin by U4 blocked its activity and led to proteome turnover ( Figures 2 and 3 ). Rather than initiating ubiquit, E ligases are thought to extend existing ubiquitin ( Cros et al 2006; Ko et al. 199 ) In this study we demonstrate the transcriptional activity of NPR is controlled by ubiqu chain-modifying enzymes. Both stepwise chain extension and trimming activities regulate NPR target gene expression and plant immunity. We show the opposing actions of E and E ligase pair and Ds fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable coactivator NPR without requirement for sacrificial turnover. Dynamic in conjugated ubiqu chain length may be a mechanism for controlling activity of eukotic ( ) activators in general. Compared to WT, SA-induced NPR accumulated in both 3/b and 4 mutants ( Figure 3 ). NPR levels cannot explain differences in transcriptional of NPR. We examined if changes polyub chain length regulate NPR association with its promoters. We examined if 4 mutants lingered in a highly active state that does not require proteome turnover To negate effects of U4 on endogenous NPR expression, seedlings constitutively expressing NPR-GFP were treated with range MG132 concentrations.

    Title: Identification of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent precursors of 24 nt siRNAs guiding de novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis
    Abstract: In Arabidopsis thaliana, abundant 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNA ) guide the cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. 24 nt siRNA biogenesis requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.

RDR2 is one of six single-subunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in Arabidopsis ( Wassenegger and Krczal, 2006; Xie et al., 2004 ). Pol IV and RDR2 are each essential for the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and they physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize ( Haag et al

. Dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, but we conclude that individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units. Our data indicate that the short double-stranded P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl3 mutants are the immediate precursors of siRNAs, based on the ability of DCL3 to cut these precursors into 24 nt RNAs in vitro. These results are consistent with those of Nagano et al

In this experiment, RNA isolated from dcl2/3/4 triple mutant plants was incubated with FLAG-tagged DCL3 that had been affinity purified from transgenic plants using anti-FLAG resin

. Based on sequence alignments and sequence motifs shared by Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) and siRNAs, we propose that siRNAs are typically generated by a single internal DCL3 cleavage event whose position is measured from either end of a short P4R2 RNA.

A recent study reported the identification of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs whose characteristics included a 5’-monophosphate group, a correspondence to known 24 nt siRNA-producing loci and accumulation in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants ( Li et al., 2015 ).

Approximately 4000–8000 loci in Arabidopsis thaliana give rise to 24 nt siRNAs that guide cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 siRNAs requires RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( R2 ) and DIC-like 3 ( D3 ). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined.

The article discusses the identification of Pol IV and R2-dependent precursors of 24 siRNAs guiding de novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thalian. The study found that Pol and R2-dependent RNAs (P2 RN) accumulate in d3 mutants and are diced into 24 RN by D3 in vitro. P2 RN are mostly 26-45 and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrim, characteristics by Pol generated in vitro R2 terminal activity, may account for occasional non-templated nucleides at P2 3 termini. The 24 siRN primarily correspond the 5 or 3 ends P RN, suggesting a model whereby siRN are generated from end P2 duplex by dicing events. The study also found that P RN that accumulate d2/4 mutants show high correspondence to 24 and si sequences genome-wide, and propose that siRN are generated by single D3 cleavage whose position from end P2. The results are consistent with previous studies that Pol and R2 are required for biogenesis of 24 and siRN and physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize.
Researchers investigated the development of neural networks in the brain, focusing on the transition from immature to mature patterns in rodents and humans. They used high-resolution electrophysiology to record activity in somatosensory cortex of mouse pups from postnatal day 5 to 14, a period spanning the transition from immature to mature patterns during sleep. Results showed that cortical dynamics shifted to temporally precise neural spiking after a discrete, relatively quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week. Synchronized firing within 10-50 ms intervals was absent prior to this period and robustly emerged afterward. This is consistent with increased pair-wise correlations of spike activity in visual cortex development. A developmental inflection may reflect rapid engagement of mechanisms enabling mature processes within networks. Analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from human subjects 36-69 weeks post- gestation revealed a similar trajectory, characterized by transient decrease in activity before onset of spatiemp oscillatory coupling. A shift from local, loosely, sensory-driven patterns to organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity preceded a quiescent period. Oscillations transformed at the beginning of the second postnatal, potentially a transition in network from highly localized processing to broader recruitment of activity. Oscill in adult organize neural across spatial and temporal scales. LFP and spiking measures followed a nonlinear trajectory marked by a transition at the beginning the postnatal in pups. A similar pattern of maturation was observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. A transient quies period may be requisite for emergence of coordinated networks.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model that extends earlier strain theory to address the effect of immune selection on multi-copy antigen-encoding genes in Plasium falciparum. The model considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression and tracks the dynamics of all unique reperto in a population of hosts. It shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain-mediated competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting reperto of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune in structuring parasite diversity.

 The model considers the effects of immune in populations of pathogens whose antigen-loci are multi-copy and recombining. It explores the shaping of the enormous diversity of reperto of genes by tracking all possible rep, given a diverse pool of variants. The model shows that structured populations resulting from selection exerted by competition among rep for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity can emerge. The model is based on the var family of P. falcum, which encodes P. falc erythrocyte membrane 1, the major antigen of the parasite's blood stages that binds to endothelial receptors to sequest within host tissues.

 The model demonstrates the emergence and maintenance of population structure under three levels of recombination, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, while keeping other parameters equal. It shows that decreasing transmission provokes nonlinear changes in dominant configurations. Importantly, results demonstrate there is not a simple relationship between diversity and repertoire. The model provides a plausible explanation for why it is difficult to eliminate malaria: non-overlapping diversity creates inherent difficulties in reducing potential to reinfect same hosts. It suggests var might provide a molecular means evaluating control.

 Each genome has up 60 genes, and sequential expression allows to evade host response and establish chronic. This clonic variation extends duration to facilitate transmission to mosquito. Limits random mating and recombination between genomes. Even under neutral, parasites differ in relatedness. The model constrains repertoire to levels orders lower than possible given diversity. Reduction occurs coexisting into variants largely discordant reperto. When transmitted from host to mosquito, there is a probability that reoccurs, resulting in new repertoire transmitted to second host.

    Title: Deamidation disrupts native and transient contacts to weaken the interaction between UBC13 and RING-finger E3 ligases
    Abstract: The deamidase OspI from enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri deamidates a glutamine residue in the host ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ). Consequently, its polyubiquitination activity in complex with the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the downstream NF-κB inflammatory response is silenced. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex is unknown. We report that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain ( TRAF6RING ) by perturbing both the native and transient interactions. Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface. Moreover, the salt-bridge competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING also prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex. Our findings highlight a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.

    Supporting Text:
   . Further studies showed that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: i ) A new intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge appears in dUBC13, which competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge in the native complex, ii ) the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6RING transient complexes to inhibit association, and iii ) transient repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING reduces

. The Shigella flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response ( NF-κB pathway ) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100. By an unknown mechanism, deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of NF-κB pathway. Q100 is present at the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6 interface but does not form direct contact with TRAF6

. These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases, eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases, IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-κB. To inactivate Nf-κB signaling, Shigella flexneri secretes a Type III effector called OspI, which functions as a deamidase ( Sanada et al., 2012 ). OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E )

. Indeed, deamidation inhibited the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6RING and to the longer dimeric TRAF6RZ3, confirming that secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/zinc-finger cannot compensate for the loss of primary E2/RING interaction. Though the interface of a protein complex has numerous interacting residues, a few hotspot residues contribute significantly to the binding energy than the rest ( Moreira et al., 2007 )

. Unlike RKIP, deamidation does not alter the local fold of UBC13. While intramolecular salt-bridges compete within RKIP, the competition is between an intermolecular and intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13. Besides the hotspots, electrostatic substitutions at the vicinity of the interface can considerably increase protein-protein association and affinity ( Selzer et al., 2000 ). Such substitutions would shift the equilibrium between native and transient complexes ( Volkov et al

. The effect of each mechanism on the binding was confirmed by binding studies using appropriate substitutions in either UBC13 or TRAF6RING. The impact of deamidation on transient interactions was also observed using another RING domain from RNF38, indicating that the mechanism could be ubiquitous for UBC13/RING complexes

. Deamidation could misfold UBC13 or inhibit the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING. These possibilities were examined by studying the impact of deamidation on the structure of UBC13 and its interaction with TRAF6RING. 15N-labeled UBC13, dUBC13, and unlabelled TRAF6RING were expressed in E. coli and purified

. Cumulatively, these mechanisms reduced the binding energy between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by 1. 69 kcal/mol. Consequently, its efficiency in activating the UBC13 ~Ub conjugate drops by 6-fold ( Figure 10F ). The effect of deamidation is also manifested in another UBC13/RING complex. Deamidation reduced the rate of Ub-discharge and the rate of Ub2 synthesis by several folds in the UBC13/RNF38RING complex ( Figure 10F and N )

., 2015 ). In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the inactivation of UBC13 upon deamidation using NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations, and in-vitro ubiquitination assays. We report that deamidation weakens the non-covalent interaction of UBC13 with RING-finger domain of TRAF6 ( TRAF6RING ), without perturbing UBC13 structure or the intrinsic enzymatic activity of UBC13

. These results provide first insights into the molecular mechanism behind the inactivation of the Ubiquitin pathway by bacterial deamidation. For several E3s like RNF38, the RING domain can function as a monomer ( Buetow et al., 2015 ). For others like TRAF6, the RING domains function as dimers ( Middleton et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2009 )

. 5 kcal/mol. Overall, the effect of deamidation on perturbing the ensemble of transient complexes was verified in another RING domain, which indicated that the mechanism could be ubiquitous in UBC13/RING complexes. If the RING domains bind weakly to dUBC13, their ability to activate the dUBC13 ~Ub conjugate should be compromised, which was tested by binding and activity assays. First, the conjugation of donor Ub to the UBC13 and dUBC13 were compared by an in-vitro conjugation reaction

. The interaction with TRAF6 is inhibited because E100 in dUBC13 competes with an intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge at the dUBC13/TRAF6RING interface to form an intramolecular salt-bridge, which destabilizes the native complex. The new intramolecular salt-bridge also inhibits the long-range transient interactions formed by R14 with TRAF6RING. In addition, repulsive interactions between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING destabilize the transient complexes

Several bacterial pathogens secrete effector proteins that inhibit or co-opt the Ubiquitin ( Ub ) pathway to suppress the immune response of the host cell ( Ashida et al., 2014 ). The human pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri inactivates the host inflammatory Nf-κB signaling, responsible for inducing inflammatory cytokine responses during pathogen invasion ( Sanada et al., 2012 )

., 2017; Yin et al., 2009 ). Since deamidation perturbed the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6 and RNF38, it is likely that deamidation inactivates UBC13 for both homo/hetero-dimeric RING-E3s. In dimeric RINGs like TRAF6, the proximal RING interacts with one unit of UBC13 ~ Ub, and the distal RING interacts with the donor Ub of another UBC13 ~ Ub

. Analysis of the UBC13/RING structures shows that R14-mediated salt-bridges are common in these complexes ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ). However, in a few complexes like UBC13/RNF4 and UBC13/RNF8, the R14 mediated salt-bridge was absent. A typical RING domain from the E3 RNF38 ( RNF38RING, aa: 387–465 ) was chosen to study the effect of UBC13 deamidation in such cases. RNF38RING can activate UBC13 to synthesize polyubiquitin chains ( Figure 9B )

. The association and stability dropped by 2. 3 fold in the dUBC13 complex at low salt, suggesting that deamidation reduces the formation of the native-like transient complex. The ensemble of transient complexes was compared between UBC13 and dUBC13 ( Figure 7 ). The distribution of TRAF6RING positions around the helix 1 of UBC13 indicates that the TRAF6RING positions are tightly clustered around the UBC13 binding interface ( Figure 7 )

    Title: Asymmetric effects of activating and inactivating cortical interneurons
    Abstract: Bidirectional manipulations – activation and inactivation – are widely used to identify the functions supported by specific cortical interneuron types. Implicit in much of this work is the notion that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid, internally consistent insights into interneurons’ computational roles. Here, using single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice, we show that this may not generally hold true. Optogenetically manipulating somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons while recording tone-responses showed that Sst+ inactivation increased response gain, while Pvalb+ inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these neurons support delineable computational functions. But activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry, and showed how relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons’ computational functions.

    Supporting Text:
   . We found that inactivation of Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivation of Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these two neuron types support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex. Yet activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences

. Can the abundance of recent causal data be interpreted in such a straightforward way? Here, in line with the broader goal of establishing the ways in which we can use causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function, we tested this assumption by manipulating either of the two main families of cortical interneurons – somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons – while recording neural responses to tones in the auditory cortex of awake mice

. 015 To evaluate how interneuron activation suppresses auditory cortical responses, we applied the same linear framework to the FTCs of the 59 units from ChR2/Sst and 57 units from ChR2/Pvalb mice whose responses were both tuned for frequency and significantly suppressed by activation of interneurons ( Figure 4d, h; Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ), excluding units that were suppressed by more than 80% ( to avoid floor effects ), and including both narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units

., 2010; Sohal et al., 2009; Stevens and Zador, 1998 ) – and the stimulus preferences of the interneurons themselves ( Atencio and Schreiner, 2010; Kerlin et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Moore and Wehr, 2013 ) are important for determining output. For example, in auditory cortex, Pvalb+ cells have been reported to be activated rapidly and by a broad set of tones, while Sst+ interneurons respond relatively slowly to a narrower range of tones ( Li et al., 2015 )

. In the context of optogenetically manipulating interneurons in the auditory cortex, comparing a neuron’s FTC in the light-on versus light-off conditions would be expected to reveal whether the change in firing in that neuron is well fit by such a model, and, if so, whether and to what extent the transformation is multiplicative/divisive ( Figure 2b ), additive/subtractive ( Figure 2c ), or a combination ( Figure 2d )

. We used a simple feedforward model to understand this asymmetry, and found that relatively small changes in key parameters, such as baseline activity, neural thresholds, or the strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce internally consistent conclusions regarding interneurons’ computational functions

. That optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons did not produce symmetric results contradicts the intuitive notion that optogenetically increasing and decreasing interneuron activity necessarily strengthens and weakens, respectively, the functions these interneurons normally serve

. 65 ). The ostensible functional equivalencies between Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons we observed with optogenetic activation, yet functional differences produced by their inactivation, is paradoxical: how can these supposedly complementary manipulations produce such inconsistent effects? We modeled the effects of inactivating and activating interneuron populations in a densely connected network

. How could optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons lead to these seemingly contradictory outcomes? One reason could be that activation and inactivation of interneurons may differentially affect how the features of interneuron-specific inhibition are propagated through a network like the cortex

. Activation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced no significant differences in any of the three domains of sensory processing that we tested, even in cases where activation of interneurons caused equivalent and strong suppression, implying that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons function equivalently in these aspects of sensory processing

Interestingly, optogenetic activation of putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons had a larger effect on spontaneous FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 3. 9 ± 2. 9; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 2. 5 ± 0. 8 ), than sound-evoked FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 2. 9 ± 1. 5; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 1. 5 ± 0

., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012 ). The findings from our model suggest that, in any of these studies, including our own, activation of Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons may have suppressed input cell firing below nonlinear spiking threshold, transforming, or obfuscating, the computational properties of interneuron-specific inhibition. Our inactivation experiments, on the other hand, mostly agree with ( Lee et al

. In this study, for example, a small population of the putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons fired weakly during the auditory stimulus ( with a mean firing rate of less than 5 Hz ), but dramatically increased their firing, often well above 30 Hz, with light stimulation. Moreover, recent work suggests that cortical Sst+ and Pvalb+ populations may contain subgroups that are differentially driven by patterns of cortical activity ( Kwan and Dan, 2012 ), stimulus features ( Runyan et al

., 2008; Wehr and Zador, 2003 ). To test whether optogenetically inactivating and activating these interneurons also produced discrepant effects on information transfer through cortical neurons, we calculated the per-trial mutual information ( in bits/trial; see Materials and methods ) between the stimulus and firing rate output, in both the light-off and light-on conditions, for each unit analyzed previously ( Figure 6a, f, example units )

. 58; Figure 5—figure supplement 5d; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0. 70; Figure 5—figure supplement 5e ). In sum, the results of our inactivation experiments would imply that Sst+ and Pvalb interneurons support separable functions in the auditory cortex, while activation of these interne revealed no such differences.
Researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to externally modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontopari network, which supports working memory (WM). They found that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Functional MRI data revealed that ACS effects depended on the relative phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during WM increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Functional results indicate that the phase of frontopetal stimulation influences information flow within WM. The study demonstrates a link between performance in a WM task and large-scale brain synchronization.

 The researchers tested four hypotheses: 1) WM performance is enhanced by entraining activity in the rightop network; 2 regional activity is modulated in a phase manner; 3 changes in BOLD by phase-dependent stimulation correlate with performance; 4 connectivity across brain regions is modulated in a phase. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous stimulation, whereas posterior increased with desynchronous, suggesting information flow can be differentially affected by phase. They provide direct evidence for the role of phase in WM processes and neural correlates.

ACS improved performance and increased frontopetal activity when demands were high, replicating previous findings that synchronous stimulation improves WM. However, effects were dependent on task demands, suggesting interactions with the extent network engaged. Synchronous activity increased theta between frontal and pariet regions during WM. Neuroimaging results show neural correlates of this effect, with increased activity in inferior parietal and middle gyrus, involved in WM. Modulations were restricted to areas involved in performance, no effects in cortical underneath the electrode.

ACS modulated functional connectivity between IPL and frontal parts of the frontop network, increasing efficiency. Results demonstrate external manipulations of oscillations impact activity and behavior, dependent on phase and cognitive state. Synchronous stimulation improved WM, increased frontal and parietal activity, and modulated parietal connectivity. Rhythmic synchrony increases network efficiency, relevant for demanding processes like WM. Front and pariet regions support WM.

    Title: The transcription factor Pitx2 positions the embryonic axis and regulates twinning
    Abstract: Embryonic polarity of invertebrates, amphibians and fish is specified largely by maternal determinants, which fixes cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. How is their polarity determined? In the chick embryo, the earliest known factor is cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1, GDF1 ), a transforming growth factor beta ( TGFβ ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cVg1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins now uncovers the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate. We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation, and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighbouring genes. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1 and Nodal are also key actors in left–right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

    Supporting Text:
   . Here we take advantage of these observations to design a molecular screen for new genes involved in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity; together with bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments we identify the transcription factor Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression both during normal development and in embryonic regulation ( induced twinning ).

In most invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates ( fishes and amphibians ), embryonic polarity is first established by localisation of maternal determinants in the cytoplasm and/or cortex of the fertilised egg. This generates differences between the blastomeres that will form by cell division from the egg, and which will culminate in specifying the orientation of the embryonic axes ( Wilson, 1898 )

. The ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a regulative model of development until such a late stage strongly suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity ( Stern and Downs, 2012 )

. These results implicate the transcription factor Pitx2 as the earliest gene described to date that regulates the position of the embryonic axis as well as embryonic regulation/regeneration and twinning.

. Taken together, these results implicate Pitx2 as a good candidate for an upstream regulator of cVg1 expression: it is a transcription factor, it is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and in bisected embryo marginal zone, and it is expressed before cVg1. 10. 7554/eLife. 03743. 012Figure 3. Time-course of expression of Pitx2 in whole embryos and in isolated anterior halves, and comparison with cVg1. ( A–F ) Time-course of Pitx2 expression in whole embryos

. The four key components that form part of this gene regulatory network initiating axis formation, Pitx2, cVg1/GDF1, Tbx6, and Nodal, are also involved a little later in development ( from the late primitive streak stage ) in specifying left–right asymmetry in different vertebrate classes ( Levin et al., 1995; Hyatt et al., 1996; Hyatt and Yost, 1998; Logan et al., 1998; Meno et al., 1998; Piedra et al., 1998; Ryan et al., 1998; St Amand et al., 1998; Yoshioka et al

. A target of cVg1 and Wnt is Nodal, transcribed in area pellucida cells next to the cVg1+Wnt expression domain ( Skromne and Stern, 2002 ). The anterior end of the embryo also has an early identity, defined by the expression of GATA binding protein 2 ( GATA2 ) ( Sheng and Stern, 1999; Bertocchini and Stern, 2012 ). However, unlike cVg1, GATA2 is not a sufficient determinant of polarity and at best only acts as a bias ( Bertocchini and Stern, 2012 )

. 17, p = 0. 44 ). To determine the temporal relationship between Pitx2 and cVg1 in whole embryos and during embryonic regulation, we compared their expression in time-course. In normal embryos cVg1 is first detected at around stage XI ( Bertocchini and Stern, 2012 ). We detected Pitx2 in the PMZ by the time of laying, stage X ( Figure 3A ), where it remains until early streak stages ( Figure 3B–F )

. The regulatory role of Pitx2 on cVg1 expression was then confirmed by loss-of-function experiments showing that Pitx2 is required for cVg1 activation and axis formation both in normal development and during embryonic regulation, and that it binds directly to four non-coding regions around the cVg1 locus ( E1, E3, E5, and E6 ), two of which ( E3 and E5 ) are sufficient to direct expression specifically to the PMZ and cVg1-expressing edge of an isolated anterior fragment

. 3 fold, with a p value of 0. 00006 ( rank 11 ) in whole embryos, and 1. 71, p = 0. 0062 in the isolated anterior half ( rank 21 ). Among all genes, Pitx2 immediately stands out as the best candidate, being very strongly co-regulated with cVg1 and the top transcription factor on the list. In the PMZ of whole embryos Pitx2 is upregulated almost 10-fold compared to the AMZ explants ( three different probes, ranking two, three and eight on the list; p = 0. 0001, 0. 00019 and 0

., 2004 ). We therefore performed two screens. First, we dissected the PMZ and an equivalent anterior explant ( anterior marginal zone, AMZ ) from 40 embryos ( in triplicate ) and analysed their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays ( Figure 1A–B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). At this stage of development, it is not possible to predict the polarity of the embryo with complete certainty

., 2004 ). This observation shows that the mechanisms that position cVg1 are active in the blastoderm stage embryo

. These results suggest that while knockdown of Pitx2 affects cVg1 expression, embryos tend to recover by 12–16 hr. We reasoned that functional redundancy with another Pitx gene, or compensatory upregulation of such a gene in response to Pitx2 knockdown, could account for this recovery. To test this, we examined Pitx1 expression in normal embryos at stages X–XII and in embryos electroporated with Pitx2-MO. Pitx1 is barely detectable in the PMZ at stage X–XII ( Figure 4—source data 1 )

. These observations raise the possibility that the left–right pathway may have evolved by co-opting a more ancient mechanism for initiating formation of the gastrular axis. This is supported by the finding that a Nodal/Pitx2 loop is involved in specifying both left–right asymmetry and mesendoderm formation ( oral-aboral polarity ) in the sea urchin, a non-vertebrate deuterostome ( Duboc et al., 2004; Hibino et al., 2006; Warner et al., 2012 )

. When a translation-blocking Pitx2-MO was targeted to the right edge of an isolated anterior half embryo, the frequency of axis formation shifted to the opposite side ( Figure 4A–D; Figure 4—source data 1A, B ) : embryos electroporated with control-MO at the right edge had random cVg1 expression on the right, left or neither edges in equal proportion. In contrast, Pitx2-MO on the right generated a majority ( 9/10, p = 0

., 2004 ). In chick embryos, the earliest symmetry breaking event known is the localised expression of cVg1, the chick orthologue of mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 ( GDF1 ) —a member of the transforming growth factor beta ( TGFβ ) superfamily of secreted proteins—encoding a Nodal/Activin-type molecule that signals through Smad2/3 ( Weeks and Melton, 1987; Thomsen and Melton, 1993; Kessler and Melton, 1995; Seleiro et al., 1996; Shah et al

The PMZ of the chick embryo is the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop centre of amphibians: it can induce a complete axis including the organiser from neighbouring cells, without making a cellular contribution to the axis ( Azar and Eyal-Giladi, 1979; Khaner and Eyal-Giladi, 1989; Bachvarova et al., 1998 ). The Nodal/Activin-related TGFβ superfamily member cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian GDF1 ) is expressed in the PM of the chick embryo before gastrulation ( Figure 2A ) and is required for axis formation ( Figure 2B–C ). The PM of the chick is also the source of the left–right asymmetry determinant Nodal ( Figure 2D–E ) and the anterior determinant GATA2 ( Figure 2F–G ), which is not sufficient to specify polarity ( Bertchini and Stern,2012 ). The anterior of the embryo has an early identity defined by GATA2 ( Sheng and Stern,1999 ; Bertchini and Stern,2012 ), but is not a determinant of polarity ( Bertch and Stern,201 ).

    Title: Projection neurons in Drosophila antennal lobes signal the acceleration of odor concentrations
    Abstract: Temporal experience of odor gradients is important in spatial orientation of animals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ). We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.

    Supporting Text:
   . PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al., 1990 ). Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al., 2011; Nagel and Wilson, 2011 ). Building on this recent advance, we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments

We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input

. It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes. We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase ( Figure 4 )

. Several recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems ( systems consisting principally of OSNs and projection neurons [PNs] ) and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals ( Bhandawat et al., 2007; Geffen et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Nagel and Wilson, 2011; Martelli et al., 2013 )

. Together, we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. 10. 7554/eLife. 06651. 009Figure 4. A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset. ( A ) A cascade of two rate-of-change transformations leads to the advancement of the peak time near to the stimulus onset, in response to a triangle-shaped input

., 2008 ). Similarly, adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume ( Budick and Dickinson, 2006 ) and staying within a specific odor zone ( Semmelhack and Wang, 2009 ). In order to enable such odor-guided tasks, it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers

., 2006 ). Moreover, natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns, and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism ( Brenner et al., 2000; Vickers et al., 2001 ). In Drosophila, OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments, termed olfactory glomeruli, which constitute a deutocerebral neuropil called the antennal lobe

., 2014 ). In one of the most sophisticated examples, Drosophila larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves ( Louis et al., 2008 )

. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in Drosophila to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment. It has also been shown that fruit flies can respond to the spatial difference of the odor concentration between two antennae in both walking and flight ( Duistermars et al., 2009; Gaudry et al., 2013 )

. We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway. We also constructed a two-dimensional ( 2D ) linear–nonlinear ( LN ) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli.

. When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs—encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change—PNs signal the rate of change and, most strongly, the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers. One remarkable example of the ‘acceleration encoding’ by PNs is found in the OSN/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input, where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs ( Figure 2C, I )

. The dynamics of OSN and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs, and all responses initiated within a few tens of milliseconds of the odor onset ( Figure 1C ). PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs. However, the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals. 10. 7554/eLife. 06651

. The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change, but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration ( Figure 2J ). Given the very same panel of olfactory stimuli, PN responses exhibited bigger peak amplitude and more stereotyped temporal patterns than OSNs ( Figure 2G–I ). All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset, and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times

., 2009; Gaudry et al., 2013 ). However, even with the lack of spatial sampling ability, fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source, based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients ( Louis et al., 2008 ). Therefore, adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source, although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state, as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight.

. Therefore, we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives ( rate of change and acceleration ) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs, respectively, acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli. To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli, we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0. 6 s and 1. 7 s after the stimulus onset ( Figure 4B, ‘odor’ curve in Figure 4C )

Odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic ( Murlis et al., 1992; Vickers et al., 2001 ), and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli ( David et al., 1983; Thesen et al., 1993; Vickers et al., 2001; Porter et al., 2007; Semmelhack and Wang, 2009; Kato et al., 2014 )

. In fact, it has been well established that insects, including fruit flies, use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters, a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients ( Budick and Dickinson, 2006 ). Furthermore, the relative position of a flying animal and the distribution of odor plumes evolve rapidly over time

. Specifically, in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals, PNs exhibited a rapid step response ( Figure 2F, I ). To step-like OSN signals, PN showed a phasic onset response, followed by a tonic spiking pattern ( Figure 2E, H ). These input/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation, where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed

. A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features—OSN spike rate, rate of change, and acceleration—confirmed this prediction ( Figure 2K ). Together, this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change, at least for the tested class of odor stimuli

. For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli ( Figure 3A ), PNs exhibited a step-like response with a peak at the odor onset ( Figure 3, I ), whereas OSNs showed a ramp-like response ( Figure 3, E ). The peak times of PN and OS responses differed by tens of milliseconds ( Figure 3, I ), with PNs peaking earlier than OS. The OS and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs ( Figure 3, C and D ), with PNs showing a bigger spike rate and more phasic spiking than OS ( Figure 3, E and F ). However, the exact transformation between OS and P could not be assessed due to the complex dynamics of OS and PN signals.10 .755/eLife.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.066.

    Title: Auxin production in the endosperm drives seed coat development in Arabidopsis 
    Abstract: In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

   ., 2009 ). Our data strongly suggest that production of auxin in the developing endosperm is likely to be the trigger for seed coat development. To further challenge this hypothesis, we investigated plants mutant for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. agl62 seeds abort early after fertilization ( around 3–4 DAP ), correlating with early endosperm cellularization ( Kang et al., 2008 ) and failure to develop a seed coat ( Roszak and Köhler, 2011 )

., 2015 ). We now propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production, both in driving endosperm and seed coat development. Additionally, the agl62 mutant has defects both in seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds. This suggests that AGL62, like auxin, is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways

. In this manuscript we provide multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: ( i ) auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization, ( ii ) impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causes defects in seed coat development, ( iii ) ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization, ( iv ) failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure

., 2003; Ingouff et al., 2006; Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ), strongly suggesting that the seed coat-initiation signal is generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm. Here, we show that seed coat development requires production of auxin in the fertilized central cell/endosperm and most likely the transport of auxin to the ovule integuments in an AGL62-dependent manner

. The fertilization of the central cell ( middle panel ) results in the production of auxin that is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, since agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm. This leads to auxin accumulation and consequently, failure to develop a seed coat ( right panel )

. We propose that AGL62 activity is important for the expression, and eventually for the activity, of endosperm-specific auxin-exporters. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20542. 021 In conclusion, we have discovered that auxin produced in the fertilized central cell is required to induce seed coat formation after fertilization and most likely acts as mobile signal linking fertilization with the differentiation of the surrounding sporophytic tissues.

. We demonstrate that application of auxin is sufficient to drive seed coat development and that AGL62 regulates the expression of P-GLYCOPROTEIN 10 ( PGP10 ), in the endosperm, which likely functions as an auxin transporter to the sporophytic tissues. Finally, we show that auxin is sufficient to remove the PRC2 block on seed coat development.

. Collectively, our data strongly support the hypothesis that auxin generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm is the trigger for seed coat formation. Impaired auxin signaling in the endosperm did not impair seed coat formation, strongly supporting the hypothesis that auxin is exported to the integuments, where it initiates downstream signaling events

. 5% of total seeds ). Seed abortion was scored at 3 DAP, in three manually dissected siliques per line. The five lines shown here are representative of 25 total analyzed lines. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20542. 015 Our observation that auxin is trapped in the endosperm of agl62 seeds suggests that AGL62 regulates the expression or activity of auxin transporters in the endosperm

. It was recently proposed that AGL62 in the endosperm also mediates non-autonomous cell signalling driving nucellus degeneration ( Xu et al., 2016 ). This transcription factor thus seems to be a central player in modulating diverse developmental pathways during seed development. While ectopic auxin production in the central cell was sufficient to initiate seed coat development, the autonomous seeds did not reach the final size of a fertilized seed and collapsed at around 6–7 DAE

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20542. 011 Previous work had revealed that the endosperm, rather than the embryo, is solely responsible for triggering the seed coat development in Arabidopsis ( Weijers et al., 2003; Ingouff et al., 2006; Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ). Thus, our data showing that auxin biosynthesis after fertilization is necessary for seed coat development, strongly supports our hypothesis that auxin needs to be produced in the endosperm to initiate seed coat development

. Auxin biosynthesis following fertilization of the central cell is dependent on the paternally-expressed genes YUC10 and TAR1 ( Figueiredo et al., 2015 ), raising the hypothesis that auxin could be the trigger for seed coat initiation

In this manuscript we reveal that auxin is the missing link connecting fertilization and seed coat development. As the maternal integuments do not take part in the fertilization process, the signal that coordinates the development of the fertilization products with the maternal integuments remained elusive ( Figueiredo and Köhler, 2016 )

. This hypothesis is in agreement with our previous observations that auxin is produced in the endosperm after fertilization ( Figueiredo et al., 2015 ). In order to test whether auxin produced in the endosperm is necessary for seed coat development, we analyzed mutants deficient either in auxin signaling ( axr1/+ axl-1/- ) or auxin biosynthesis ( wei8/- tar1/- tar2-1/+ and wei8/- tar1/- tar2-2/+ )

., 2005; Lin and Wang, 2005 ), raising the possibility that lack of PGP10 expression could account for the accumulation of auxin in the endosperm of agl62 seeds. In order to test whether PGP10 was expressed in the endosperm, we developed a PGP10::GFP reporter and investigated its expression in ovules and seeds of Arabidopsis. Consistently, PGP10 was expressed before fertilization in the central cell and its expression was maintained in the endosperm after fertilization ( Figure 5G–H )

., 2008; Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ), we hypothesized whether this transcription factor could be involved in regulating the pathways driving seed coat development. Consistently, GA signaling was not activated in agl62 integuments, as evidenced by the maintained GFP signal of the RGA DELLA reporter ( RGA::GFP:RGA ) in agl62 seeds ( Figures 1G and 5D ). Importantly, also auxin signaling was impaired in agl62 integuments, which failed to express the DR5::VENUS reporter

., 2006 ). Furthermore, the absence of the endothelium integument layer results in seed abortion, highlighting the importance of the developing seed coat for the establishment of a viable seed ( Mizzotti et al., 2012 ). Endosperm initiation in Arabidopsis is coupled to the production of auxin in the central cell following fertilization ( Figueiredo et al., 2015 ) ; however, the factor initiating seed coat development is yet to be described

. Thus, lack of PRC2 function and ectopic auxin are sufficient to initiate seed coat development in the absence of fertilization; we therefore asked whether auxin and PRC2 act in the same pathway initiating seed coat development. To test this hypothesis, we generated triple mutant plants that have reduced PRC2 function and produce auxin ectopically in the integuments by combining mutant alleles for yuc6-2d, vrn2/- and emf2/+

. We thus conclude that auxin signaling in the fertilization products ( endosperm ) is necessary for seed coat development and that AGL regulates auxin export from the endperm to the integuments.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library) to create a large, unbiased library of bacteriophage (phage) variants at a targeted gene locus. Using ORACLE, they comprehensively mutated the tip domain of the T7 phage by making single amino acid substitutions at every site (166 variants) and quantified the functional role of variants on multiple hosts. The study generated high-resolution maps delineating regions with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific patterns, many of which were previously unknown. They discovered T variants with greater virulence than wildtype T7, demonstrating even natural phages adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. The results indicate OR can generate ph variants superior to wildtype that become starting points for further engineering ph.

The researchers used OR to engineer T variants against Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip and identifies functional regions determining activity and host range. OR can be used to investigate several genes, including the remainder of the fiber and structure, capsid components, orins, and holins, providing a comprehensive view of molecular determinants of structure, function, and evolution of ph. The approach can tune activity known ph with high, such as T, or identify targets increase for newly isolated ph. The confluence of engineering, high-through DNA synthesis, and sequencing by OR with metagenomics can transform ph biology.

The study identified hundreds of function-enhancing substitutions not previously characterized and mapped to the structure to rationalize sequence and influence activity host range. Engineered domain variants may abate bacterial insensitivity and be active at low MO by adsorbing to native or recognizing new receptor. To test, they chose pathogenic E. coli isolate from patient UT. Although T can infect UT, insensitivity arises rapidly, a common with ph use. OR is a high-through precision ph genome technology to create large unbiased ph variants investigate sequence-function in ph. It overcomes major hurdles: ph variants created during natural cycle, eliminating bottleneck from DNA.

The results highlight extraordinary potential of the tip and rational pervasive use this fold for molecular recognition. Comparison profiles reveal regions ideal targets customizing host and intolerant residues avoid engineering. OR can be used to investigate several genes, including remainder fiber, structure, components, orins, and holins, providing comprehensive view molecular determinants structure, function, and evolution ph.

    Title: Altered functional connectivity during speech perception in congenital amusia
    Abstract: Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing. Accordingly, they downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. We investigated the neural basis for this strategy. During fMRI, individuals with amusia ( N = 15 ) and controls ( N = 15 ) read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary. They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism.

    Supporting Text:
    We found that individuals with amusia, who have been previously shown to rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language ( Jasmin et al., 2020a ), exhibited decreased functional connectivity between left frontal areas and right hemisphere pitch-related regions. In our task, participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented sentences based on pitch, duration, or both these acoustic dimensions together

. It remains an open question how functional connectivity in amusic and non-amusic participants may differ during speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks within regions of interest selected with a whole-brain data-driven approach. To determine whether the relative reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception is reflected in functional connectivity, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls

. Our results are consistent with an account that right hemisphere auditory areas are not only abnormally connected to right frontal areas ( as observed during tonal tasks ) but are less integrated with frontal left hemisphere regions when processing speech and language. Our null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions

. For example, the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex has been shown to be similar in participants with amusia and controls ( Norman-Haignere et al., 2016 ). Brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is similarly unimpaired in individuals with amusia ( Liu et al., 2015b )

. We suggest, therefore, that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas which integrate information from perceptual regions

. By contrast, individuals with amusia, who have unreliable perception of and memory for pitch ( analogous to the ‘noise’ introduced in the multisensory integration studies cited above ), would have learned that, for them, pitch is not a reliable cue for processing spoken language. Thus, by analogy to the multisensory weighting results described above, we hypothesize that amusics may exhibit decreased connectivity between language regions and pitch-related areas during speech processing

. In highly controlled laboratory tasks in which speech perception judgments must be made based on pitch alone, only minor deficits have been observed in amusia ( Liu et al., 2015a; Patel et al., 2008 ). In naturalistic speech perception contexts, people with amusia rarely report any difficulties ( Liu et al., 2010 ). This may be because, in natural speech, pitch variation tends to co-occur with variation in other acoustic dimensions, such as duration and amplitude

., 2020a ), that functional connectivity will not differ between amusics and controls on this task, a finding which would not be predicted by the pitch awareness account of amusia. We note that a previous fMRI study on amusia detected group differences in functional connectivity during passive listening to tones

Congenital amusia is a rare condition characterized by impaired perception of and memory for pitch ( Peretz et al., 2002 ). Although congenital amusia presents as an auditory condition, auditory cortical responses are normal ( Moreau et al., 2013; Norman-Haignere et al., 2016 ), as is subcortical encoding of pitch ( Liu et al., 2015b )

. The evidence above suggesting that encoding of pitch in the brainstem and auditory cortex and pre-attentive responses to pitch changes are unaffected in amusia can be interpreted as suggesting that the fundamental deficit in amusia may not be increased perceptual noise or decreased pitch awareness but difficulties with retention of pitch information in memory ( see Tillmann et al., 2016 for review )

., 2009; but see Chen et al., 2015 ). Our interpretation of differences in functional connectivity between amusics and controls diverges somewhat from these previous approaches: we argue that down-weighting of pitch information during perceptual categorization in both speech and music is adaptive, inasmuch as amusics have learned that pitch is an unreliable source of evidence relative to other perceptual dimensions

., 2015b ). The dominant view of amusia’s neural basis is that connectivity between right inferior frontal cortex and right auditory cortex is impaired, resulting in impaired conscious access to pitch information for guiding behavior ( Hyde et al., 2011; Albouy et al., 2013; Leveque et al., 2016; Zendel et al., 2015; see Peretz, 2016 for review )

. Furthermore, pitch fluctuations in the stimuli were above participants’ thresholds, even in the Duration-Informative condition ( where the standard deviation of F0 over each spoken utterance was, on average, 2. 7 semitones ), and so it is unsurprising that functional connectivity did not change on a trial-by-trial basis, and instead the same ‘neural strategy’ was employed to process speech regardless of the trial type

., 2015; see Peretz, 2016 for review ). While congenital amusia is believed to be innate, there is evidence that recovery is possible through training ( Whiteford and Oxenham, 2018 ). Although pitch is usually associated with music, it is also important for cueing categories in spoken language ( de Pijper and Sanderman, 1994; Streeter, 1978 ) and conveying emotion in speech ( Frick, 1985 )

., 2003; Hohmann et al., 2018 ). We suggest that this decreased connectivity between right hemisphere pitch and left hemisphere frontal cortices may relate to the unreliability of the amusics’ perception of and memory for pitch. This is similar to the ‘weighted connections’ model of multisensory integration, where a more ( or less ) reliable modality is given a stronger ( or weaker ) weight ( Beauchamp et al., 2010 )

. The neural foundations of perceptual weighting in speech have thus far not been investigated in atypical individuals. Indeed, only one previous functional neuroimaging study has examined the neural processing of spoken material in people with amusia. In this study, no group differences were detected in task-related activation or functional connectivity during processing of speech ( whereas group differences were observed during processing of tones; Albouy et al., 2019 )

. Consistent with this proposal, we found in the present study that right inferior frontal cortex exhibited strongly decreased functional connectivity in the amusia group, and follow-up seed testing revealed that right auditory areas were involved as well. However, we also found that sites in left frontal cortex also showed large decreases in connectivity in amusia, also most prominently with right hemisphere auditory areas

. The most prominent of these results was decreased connectivity between left frontal regions classically implicated in language processing ( left IFG and DLPFC ) and right hemisphere regions —in the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, Heschl’s gyrus, and anterior insula—that have been implicated in pitch processing ( Lee et al., 2011; Garcea et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2003; Hohmann et al., 2018 )

. Furthermore, an account of amusia which suggests that the disorder primarily stems from differences in structural connectivity cannot account for the recent finding that functional connectivity patterns do not differ between amusics and controls during a verbal memory task ( Albouy et al., 2019 ), as well as our finding that amusics and controls show similar functional connectivity patterns during passive listening to tone sequences

. 5 indicating greater reliance on pitch than duration, and values less than 0. 5 indicating greater reliance on duration than pitch ( Experiment 1, Jasmin et al., 2020a ). These cue weights were assessed with respect to the functional connectivity results reported above. Across this subset of participants, normalized cue weights were correlated with L-DLPFC <=> R insula connectivity ( Spearman R = 0. 78, p=0. 000037 ), and L-DLPFC <=> R auditory cortex connectivity ( Spearman R = 0

A study investigated the neural basis of congenital amus, a condition characterized by impaired pitch perception and memory. Fifteen individuals with amus and fifteen controls participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Participants read sentences with a comma indicated grammatical boundary, then heard two spoken sentences differing in pitch and/or duration, and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amia group between left frontal language regions and right pitch-related regions, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. Connectivity between these regions was not present during a control task. Results indicate the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to functional between frontal and perceptual regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

The study found individuals with amia, who rely less on pitch than controls to process language, exhibited decreased connectivity between left frontal and right pitch regions. The task involved matching spoken sentences with visually presented based on pitch, duration, or both dimensions. Results are consistent with an account that right auditory areas are not abnormally connected to frontal as during tonal tasks but less integrated with left regions when processing speech and language. No group differences in activation or connectivity were observed during speech processing, consistent with prior reports that amics and controls do not differ in pitch representations. The extent of pitch-responsive regions in auditory cortex was similar in participants with amia and controls. Brain encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli was unimpaired in individuals with amia.

The study suggests amics neglect pitch because they learned their memory for pitch is unreliable, down-weighting pitch reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and task-relevant areas. In contrast, individuals amia with unreliable perception and memory for pitch may exhibit decreased connectivity between language and pitch areas during processing. In controlled tasks, speech judgments based on pitch only, minor deficits were observed in amia. In natural speech contexts, amia rarely report difficulties, possibly due to pitch variation co-occurring with other dimensions like duration and amplitude.

    Title: The newly-arisen Devil facial tumour disease 2 (DFT2) reveals a mechanism for the emergence of a contagious cancer
    Abstract: Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) is a recently discovered contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ), a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ). Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules, demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. In parallel, MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo, thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.

    Supporting Text:
   . Why DFT2 cells can pass between individuals without a protective immune response from the host is not known, nor are the conditions that have facilitated the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species. Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules. However, the dominantly expressed MHC class I alleles are either non-classical or shared with host devils and common in the wider population

Here we show that DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo. This is in stark contrast to DFT1, a likely older and more widespread contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil, which has lost expression of MHC class I ( Siddle et al., 2013 ). However, DFT2 cells express the non-polymorphic, non-classical MHC class I molecule ( Saha-UK ) likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumour cells

. Further, the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils. Finally, we show that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely. Our results demonstrate that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, in contrast to DFT1 and the contagious cancer circulating among dogs, CTVT

. Thus, further detailed analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution. While DFT1 cells currently circulating in the population are MHC class I negative, it is possible that DFT1 down regulated MHC class I expression after the tumour became transmissible and that initial transmission events were among individuals that shared prevalent MHC class I alleles

. The similarity of the MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder's ( Stammnitz et al., 2018 ). Thus, the frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further. The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2

. The classical MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells should play a role in any host immune response against the tumour. To assess the MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells we amplified, cloned and sequenced exon 2 ( the region of the devil MHC class I where the majority of variation is located ) of MHC class I transcripts from DFT2 cell lines

. The emergence of a contagious cancer that can transmit while maintaining MHC class I expression indicates that loss of MHC is not necessary for transmission, but as the tumour encounters the immune system of genetically disparate hosts subclones that have down-regulated MHC may be selected. Our results predict that loss of MHC class I is already occurring, perhaps due to structural mutations or epigenetic changes

. The primers designed in this study should amplify all known DFT1 and DFT2 MHC class I alleles with equal efficiency, suggesting that this allele represents an MHC class I locus with dominant expression. As well as being found in the host devils, this allele is highly prevalent in at least one devil population ( Lane et al., 2012 ) and the high expression levels in DFT2 may be facilitating tolerance of the tumour in this population of devils

. However, further investigation is needed to determine the function of these molecules and the functional classification of Tasmanian devil MHC class I molecules as ‘classical’ or ‘non-classical’. DFT2 cells also express classical MHC class I alleles belonging to the Saha-UA, -UB and -UC loci. Of these classical MHC class I alleles, SahaI*27 is the most abundant in DFT2 cells and is also found in the three host devils, reducing the immunogenicity of DFT2 cells in these animals

. While this analysis is not quantitative, as the amount of stroma in each sample varies between tumours, these results show that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I transcripts alongside β2m. To further investigate the expression of MHC class I molecules between DFT2 tumours in vivo, a shared peptide immunogen was used to raise a pan-classical MHC I antibody against the classical MHC class I heavy chains ( Saha-UA, -UB and -UC )

Contagious cancers have emerged and circulate in two species of mammals ( dogs and Tasmanian devils ) and four species of molluscs ( Metzger et al., 2015, 2016; Novinski, 1876; Pearse and Swift, 2006 ). The Tasmanian devil is the only mammalian species in which two independent contagious cancers exist, Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) ( Pye et al., 2016b )

., 2018 ). As allografts, DFT1 and DFT2 cells should be rejected by the host devil through T cell recognition of non-self MHC class I molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) ( Sherman and Chattopadhyay, 1993 )

. This is supported by previous studies that have found reduced polymorphism in devil MHC and microsatellite loci ( Jones et al., 2007; Siddle et al., 2007 ). In addition, a hemizygous deletion of β2m has recently been identified in a DFT1 cell line, perhaps indicating past selective pressure for MHC class I loss in this older transmissible tumour ( Stammnitz et al., 2018 )

. While these alleles have lower expression on DFT2 than SahaI*27, their presence may still initiate an immune response in some host animals, providing a selective pressure for MHC class I loss. It is possible that, like single organism tumours, DFT2 is undergoing immunoediting ( Dunn et al., 2002 ), which can operate to down-regulate specific MHC class I alleles that are immunogenic ( McGranahan et al

. Finally, DFT2 tumours were identified with evidence of MHC class I loss, indicating the emergence of MHC class I down-regulation in this tumour.

., 2017 ) or select for mutations that remove or modulate total MHC class I expression. However, while four of the six primary DFT2 tumours examined have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass, which may indicate an immune response, the infiltration is notably present in DFT2_812, which is negative for classical MHC class I and could be expected to be CD3 negative

. The degree of individual tumour cell nuclear pleomorphism can also vary within the same tumour ( DFT2_SNT2 ). The expression of MHC molecules by DFT2 cells may mean that this tumour is more immunogenic than DFT1. As infiltration of lymphocytes has been correlated with a positive prognostic outcome for some cancers ( Galon et al., 2006; Chee et al., 2017 ) we stained DFT2 tumours for the lymphocyte marker, CD3

., 2013 ). This is the first indication that DFT1 cells have similar immune evasion mechanisms to those found in single organism tumours ( Hicklin et al., 1999; McGranahan et al., 2017 ). Loss of MHC class I is due to epigenetic down-regulation of β2m, and the peptide transporter encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 ( Siddle et al., 2013 ) but MHC class I can be restored in DFT1 cells when treated with IFNγ ( Siddle et al., 2013 )

., 2002; Pérez et al., 1998 ). However, subsequent cytokine signalling leads to lymphocyte infiltration of the tumour and activation of cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, D2 tumours with high MHC I expression have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass, indicating an immune response to the tumour. The presence of CD3 positive cells in D2 tumours with MHC I expression suggests that these tumours may be targeted by cytotoxic T cells

The Tasman devil is the only mammalian species with two contagious cancers, D1 and D2 ( Py et al,2016b,2018 ). D1 has lost MHC I expression ( Siddle et al,2013 ) while D2 expresses MHC I ( this study ). D1 is older and more contagious than D2, suggesting that loss of MHC I may facilitate transmission of D1. D2 may mimic the evolutionary trajectory of D1, with MHC I loss emerging in vivo. Our results suggest that contagious cancers exploit partial histocompatibility between tumour and host, and loss of allogenic antigens may facilitate transmission of D2

The Tasman devil is the only mammalian species with two contagious cancers, D1 and D2 ( Py et al,201b,2018 ) D1 has lost MHC I ( Siddle et,201 ) while D2 expresses M I ( this study ) D1 is older and more contagious than D2 suggesting that loss M I may facilitate transmission of1 D2 may mimic the evolutionary trajectory of1 with M I emerging in vivo Our results suggest that contagious exploit partial histocompatibility between tumour host and loss allogenic antigens facilitate D2

    Title: Thalamus and claustrum control parallel layer 1 circuits in retrosplenial cortex
    Abstract: The granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Here, we use optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase ( LR ) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking ( RS ) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1, in particular, permits this parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Thus, parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG.

   . In summary, our results highlight a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells

. Determining how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices is the next critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations.

. Specifically, we find that anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum preferentially control LR neurons, whereas claustrum and anterior cingulate control RS cells. We show that the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed

Layer 3 of the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) contains two types of principal pyramidal neurons: the low-rheobase ( LR ) neuron and the regular-spiking ( RS ) neuron ( Brennan et al., 2020; Kurotani et al., 2013; Yousuf et al., 2020 )

., 2020; Yamawaki et al., 2019a ). Thus, the distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum. Indeed, this integration of various types of directional and distance information is often stated as the key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole ( van Wijngaarden et al., 2020; Burgess et al

. Thus, LR cells are the defining morphological feature of RSG. The distinct electrophysiological properties of LR neurons, specifically, play an integral role in the RSG’s unique capacity to process anterior thalamic head direction inputs. We have previously reported that the low rheobase and lack of spike frequency adaptation of these neurons are their defining computational features ( Brennan et al., 2020 ). For this reason, we refer to them as low-rheobase ( LR ) neurons

. Thalamic, claustral, and cortical inputs all converge in the RSG, but whether they do so via parallel or integrative control of target excitatory neurons remains unknown. Within the RSG, the superficial layers contain two subtypes of principal excitatory pyramidal neurons that have strikingly distinct physiology, morphology, and computational capabilities: the low-rheobase ( LR ) neuron and the regular-spiking ( RS ) neuron ( Brennan et al., 2020; Kurotani et al

. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses for LR downstream targets and possible function: LR neurons in one hemisphere receive unilateral inputs from directional cells in the anterior thalamus ( Figures 1, 2 and 6 ). These inputs are utilized to encode information about both the speed and direction of head rotations and are subsequently transmitted to RS cells in contralateral, but not ipsilateral, RSG ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 )

., 2012 ), as also revealed by our examination of anatomical datasets from the Allen Brain Institute ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ). Thus, our findings may also highlight a more universal framework by which other cortical regions integrate and process thalamic versus claustral and cortical inputs. To investigate the functional implications of these parallel circuits, we next examined the short-term dynamics of each input onto the RSG principal cells

. Together, our results suggest that LR neurons are ideally positioned to contribute to the initial spatial orientation computations performed in superficial RSG.

. Taken together, these results suggest that synaptic depression of HD ensemble inputs introduces an angular head speed signal into the LR population, producing neurons that are more responsive during faster head turns, and potentially supporting the spatial orientation encoding functions attributed to the RSG ( Epstein, 2008; Ino et al., 2007; Milczarek et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2019 ). Anterior thalamic HD cells display anticipatory firing ( Blair et al

. This proposed mechanism by which depressing synapses compute head speed is fully generalizable, and thus may also be of relevance to other brain circuits employing HD-like population codes ( Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983 ). Furthermore, we have shown that this thalamocortical synapse can support conjunctive encoding of both head direction and angular head speed by individual LR cells ( Figure 10 )

. Regardless, retrosplenial RS neurons may be receiving direct spatial inputs from the CLA and ACC in addition to the cognitive and mnemonic information relayed by these two regions. We also speculate that retrosplenial RS neurons may receive directional and spatial information that has already been heavily integrated by LR neurons in the contralateral hemisphere ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ), as discussed above

. This demonstrates that LR neurons are uniquely anatomically adapted to respond to incoming inputs from the anterior thalamus, where ~ 60% of neurons are head direction cells ( Taube, 1995; Taube and Bassett, 2003 ), due to a precise overlap of their apical dendrites with the dense thalamic axons and terminals in the uppermost sublamina of L1 ( L1a )

. 65, p=3. 00e-215; Figure 6C ), highlighting the distinct anatomical organization of these two neighboring principal cell types. Taken together, these axon-axon, dendrite-dendrite, and axon-dendrite correlations indicate that precise, fine-grained laminar organization of LR and RS dendrites and afferent axons creates a parallel circuit in which LR neurons are selectively optimized to integrate incoming spatial information ( Figure 6D )

., 2002; Yamawaki et al., 2019b ). Matrix thalamocortical ( TC ) inputs from the anterior thalamus, which contains the highest proportion of head direction cells in the brain ( Taube and Bassett, 2003 ), influence layer 5 pyramidal cells in RSG ( Yamawaki et al., 2019b ). However, potential subtype-specific responses and their functional impact on the encoding of directional information in RSG have yet to be examined

. Now, the output of this LR cell is better correlated with direction, acting as a broadly tuned HD cell itself and preferring 180 degrees, but also firing at most other directions. However, this LR cell’s encoding of head speed gets worse because it under-samples many of the head directions faced by an animal. Thus, non-uniform HD inputs via depressing thalamocortical synapses represent a simple mechanism by which LR cells can conjunctively encode both head direction and head speed

. Future work will examine the effect of feedforward inhibition on the subpopulations of retrosplenial principal neurons in response to these converging inputs in order to establish a thorough understanding of the circuitry facilitating retrosplenial information processing, particularly with regard to head direction signals

. We next used computational modeling to elucidate the functional role of synaptic depression in this circuit, especially with respect to the processing of head direction input ( Taube, 1995; Taube and Bassett, 2003 ). Up to 60% of cells in the anterior thalamus are classical head direction ( HD ) cells ( Taube and Bassett, 2003 ). Each HD cell has a unique preferred direction at which its firing rate is highest when the head is facing that direction

. Overall, our results predict in vivo LR neuronal spike trains that are likely to correlate with both the head direction and rotational speed of an animal, with a tradeoff between direction versus speed coding seen across individual LR cells ( Figure 10E ).

The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Optogenetic mapping in mice reveals a dissociation that parallel circuits in superficial SG process disparate inputs. The thalamus and subiculum sources spatial information and selectively recruit low-rhease (LR) pyramidal cells in SG. In contrast, regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of non-spatial information. Precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within SG layer 1 permits parallel processing. Thalamocort synaptic dynamics enable LR to compute speed of rotation despite head inputs not explicitly encoding speed. Parallel streams identify a principal subtype to support spatial computations in SG.

LR receive directional and spatial inputs from thalam and subulum. Synaptic dynamics of thamic to cells give rise to rate coding of angular speed in LR. Determining two streams integration in downstream neurons within ipsilateral and contralateral gran and granular dysgranular SG is critical toward mechanistic understanding SG computations. Thalam and subulum preferentially control LR, while clastr and culate control RS. Synaptic of thamic allow robust encoding of angular by LR models, though inputs only contain direction not speed.

Layer 3 SG contains two types of pyramidal neurons: low-rase (LR) and regular-sp (RS) (Brennan et al, 202; Ktani et al,201; Yuf et,202).LR are suited to integrate direction from thalam and spatial from hippocamp via subulum. Integration of directional and distance is key function of SG as a whole (Wngarden et,202; Burgess et).LR are defining feature of SG. Electrophys properties of LR play integral in SG capacity to process thamic head inputs. We previously reported lowase and lack of spike adaptation defining features (Bnan et,202).LR are referred to as lowase.

Thalam, clastr, and cortical converge in SG, whether via parallel or integrative control of excitatory neurons unknown. Superficial layers contain two subtypes of excit pyram with distinct physiology, morphology, and capabilities: lowase (LR) and regular-sp (RS) (Bnan et,202; Kt et. We propose LR targets and function: LR receive unilateral from directional in thalam (Figures 1,2,6). Inputs encode speed and direction of rotations and transmitted to contralateral but not ipsilateral SG (figure supplement 1). Anatomical from Allen (figure supplement).LR are positioned to contribute spatial computations in SG.

    Title: Seizures are a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and subsequent tauopathy
    Abstract: Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ). The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Here, we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. We introduce ‘tauopathy reporter’ zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post–traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.

   . Zebrafish larvae, fostered by appropriate innovations, now offer a potent complement both to rodent models of TBI and to cellular models of tauopathy. Our engineered fish allowed us to reveal post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy

., 2014; Kovacs et al., 2014 ). We hypothesized that neuronal excitability and seizure activity after TBI can play a role in accelerating the wide dissemination of Tau pathology. As such, we introduced two new approaches to test this hypothesis. The first approach was to engineer a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS

. In sum, our data reveal a substantial burst of neural activity occurs during TBI, and that zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI subsequently exhibit a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures. After validating that our method was able to induce TBI upon zebrafish larvae, we next asked whether TBI induces Tau aggregates in our Tau biosensor model

. Combining these novel approaches, we found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI. Manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI. The results from our novel in vivo TBI model implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets.

., 2020 ) offering an additional opportunity for zebrafish to be an important tool and bridge organism in the field of neurotrauma. The post-traumatic seizures apparent in our TBI model led us to consider the neural events occurring during the TBI, and their potential bearing on the correlation between neural activity and tauopathy

. Our zebrafish models allow us to study the progression and spread of TBI-induced tauopathy longitudinally in living animals, an experimental advantage that is unmatched among TBI animal models. Regarding TBI, a large knowledge gap exists regarding how Tau seeds are released and/or internalized by adjacent ( or far-flung ) cells - indeed the prion-like properties of Tau species following TBI had not been assessed until very recently ( Woerman et al., 2016; Zanier et al., 2018 )

. We selected drugs that are well-established to behave similarly in zebrafish as in mammals, although it is perhaps notable that the multi-day drug application used here is longer than the acute applications typically considered in zebrafish ( Ellis et al., 2012 ). Our hypothesis predicted that decreasing seizure-like activity following TBI would reduce tauopathy

. This knowledge gap is due in part to a lack of accessible in vivo models that can report the progression and spread of tauopathy, or that allow neural activity associated with TBI to be measured and manipulated. To address these issues, we engineered a tauopathy biosensor transgenic zebrafish that develops GFP+ puncta when Tau aggregates within the brain or spinal cord. Additionally, we introduce a simple medium-throughput method to induce TBI in zebrafish larvae

. 001 ) in comparison to larvae that showed no seizure-like response to TBI ( Figure 5E ). To assess the hypothesis that seizure activity has a causal role in increasing the abundance of Tau aggregates in our TBI model, we employed convulsant and anti-convulsant drugs to modulate the seizure intensity and in vivo neural activity

. To test if the Tau4R-GFP biosensor can report the in vivo progression of tauopathy, we emulated intracerebral injection methods that induce ( prion-like ) Tau pathology in mice ( Clavaguera et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Peeraer et al., 2015 ). We injected clarified brain homogenate laden with human Tau fibrils, prepared as above from Tg mice, into the hindbrain ventricle of 2 days post-fertilization ( dpf ) Tau biosensor zebrafish ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A )

. 0104 ) ( Figure 2D ). The distribution of larvae based on the number of Tau aggregates they accumulated also supported these findings ( Figure 2E ). In sum, the Tau4R biosensor deployed in the CNS of larval zebrafish was able to report Tau species, and further revealed the prion-like induction of tauopathy via protein-only seeding in vivo

. Considering the clinical prominence of post-traumatic seizures following TBI, and the suggested role of cell stress and increased neural activity in promoting protein misfolding diseases ( Kovacs et al., 2014; Sánchez et al., 2018 ), we speculated that post-traumatic seizures might form a causal link between TBI and subsequent tauopathy. We first asked if a correlation exists between seizure intensity and extent of tauopathy

. Indeed, we had noted the occurrence of post-traumatic seizures in most of our TBI samples, which is in agreement with the prevalence of seizures in blast TBI patients and TBI rodent models ( Bugay et al., 2020; Kovacs et al., 2014 ). However, whether post-traumatic seizures contribute to prion-like spreading of Tau pathology ( observed after TBI or not ) was unknown. Beyond TBI, several investigations have supported an association between Tau pathology and seizures ( Sánchez et al

., 2016 ). Indeed, our data from the application of the convulsant kainate here support the role of post-traumatic seizure in enhancing Tau abundance and cell death in our TBI model ( Figure 5G, H ). This finding is in line with observations in a patient with epilepsy and a history of head injury, in which progressive Tau pathology was noted ( Geddes et al., 1999; Thom et al., 2011 )

. Thus, anti-convulsants are intriguing as a route to slowing progression of tauopathy following TBI, and it is encouraging that they are already commonly deployed to prevent post-traumatic seizures. One particular convulsant drug, 4-AP, inhibited tauopathy in our TBI model ( Figure 6A and B ), contrary to our hypothesis that seizure intensity is positively correlated with tauopathy following TBI

., 2014; Woerman et al., 2016 ). Tau is predominantly expressed in the neurons of the CNS, and we reasoned that fluorescent biosensor tools would have good potential to reveal additional phenotypes when expressed in these cells and moreover, that prion-like mechanisms of tauopathy spread are best modeled in an intact brain ( e. g. vectored by blood and glymphatic circulation, ventricles, axonal projections, and immune systems )

., 1999; Thom et al., 2011 ). Intriguingly, reducing seizure activity after TBI via anti-convulsant drugs was able to significantly reduce tauopathy and cell death, providing further evidence of the relationship between seizures and tauopathy in TBI ( Figure 5F, G and H ). The mechanism of drug action appears to be dominated by its anticonvulsant properties, because its effects were reversed by co-application of convulsants

. Overall, convulsant and anti-convulsant drugs acted to increase and decrease TBI-induced tauopathy, respectively. The drugs appear to be specific – their individual impacts on tauopathy and cell death are largely attributable to their epileptic and anti-epileptic modulation of post-traumatic seizures, because when kainate and retigabine were applied concurrently they negated each others’ effects

. Regarding the etiology of tauopathy subsequent to TBI, the CaMPARI quantification provided us important validation that neural activity was substantively impacted by TBI, complementing the evidence of increased seizure-like movements. This supported our rationale that convulsant and anti-convulsant drug treatments might modulate neural activity and thereby accelerate or decelerate tauopathy accumulation

. We inspected the role of seizure activity and/or neuronal excitability, as well as the role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis, during the progression of tauopathy after TBI. Our data suggest that seizures and endocyt are druggable mechanistic links between TBI and tauopathy, and that anti-convants dampening post-tra seizures may be a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy

Our zebraf model of TBI recapitulates key features of human T, including cell death, postumatic seizures, and tau inclusions, and provides a tractable system to study the progression of tauopathy in vivo.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data. They found that the shape and location of brain regions interact with measures of connectivity and that spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. The study suggests that cross-subject variations in spatial configuration of brain are often interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. The researchers used Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to extract modes of-subject covari that represent correlations between behavioral and fMRI measures, uncovering multivariate relationships between brain and behavior. Results show that spatial features such as P subject maps and task maps are strongly associated with behavior. 

The study used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and found systematic differences in the organization of functional regions. The presence of behaviorally spatial variability is surprising because data were aligned using Multimodal Matching (MSM) approach driven by structural and cortical features. Researchers identified a key aspect of rf data that reflects variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. Results indicate spatial in topography of regions is associated with behavior. The findings have implications for future rf research and interpretation of findings. The study highlights the need for methods that accurately capture functional in subjects.

    Title: TBP/TFIID-dependent activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells
    Abstract: Change in the identity of the components of the transcription pre-initiation complex is proposed to control cell type-specific gene expression. Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression. The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis. We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs. While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression. This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed, with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression.

    Supporting Text:
    In this work, we demonstrate that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts, nor from primary mouse MuSCs. Consistently, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs

. Our data demonstrating the lack of requirement of TBP2 for adult skeletal muscle regeneration prompted us to compare the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild type mouse by FACS, and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line ( Blau et al., 1983 ). Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes ( Figure 2A )

. However, Gazdag et al. did not explore the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life, and thus have not ruled out the possibility that TBP2 can specifically promote the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem ( satellite ) cells ( MuSCs ) - the direct effectors of post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis ( Chang and Rudnicki, 2014 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 006 The requirement of TBP for skeletal muscle differentiation and the absence of TBP2 in skeletal myotubes suggest that the TFIID complex may be present in myogenic cells and may drive muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation into myotubes. To test this hypothesis we have set out to detect expression of TAF subunits of the TFIID complex in both cultured C2C12 and MuSC myoblasts and myotubes at the RNA and protein levels

. This result indicates that there are no defects in MuSC ontogenesis in the absence of Tbpl2 expression. Importantly, we detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury ( Figure 1B lower panel, 1C ), indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2

. This evidence firmly supports the conclusion that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed by Deato et al. ( Deato and Tjian, 2007 ). We have observed downregulation of TFIID subunits at both the RNA and protein levels in differentiated myotubes, compared to proliferating myoblasts, as has previously been reported ( Deato and Tjian, 2007; Zhou et al., 2013 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 003 Our in vivo data on adult muscle regeneration, as well as the intact differentiation potential of Tbpl2-lacking MuSCs ex vivo demonstrate that TBP2 is dispensable for adult skeletal muscle differentiation

To investigate the role of TBP2 in postnatal and adult skeletal myogenesis in vivo we assessed the muscle regeneration potential of TBP2 null mice ( Gazdag et al., 2009 ) in response to injury. Notexin-mediated muscle injury triggers extensive muscle damage and stimulates adult muscle regeneration and post-natal myogenesis in vivo, during which damaged muscle is replaced by newly formed myofibers arising from activated MuSCs

., 2008; Yao et al., 2011 ). This finding suggested that the widely established paradigm of a universal and prevalent use of TFIID as a promoter-recognizing complex in a variety of somatic cells might undergo drastic change during development. Nevertheless this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2 null ( TBP2_KO = TBP2 knock out ) mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype ( Gazdag et al

. Since TAF3 has been proposed as a mediator of TBP2 recruitment to muscle gene promoters ( Deato et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2011 ), these data provide the rationale for investigating whether TBP2 deficiency can impair post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis.

. Altogether, our results are contrary to previously reported data ( Deato and Tjian, 2007 ) and demonstrate that the TFIID complex is not replaced by TBP2 upon myogenic differentiation. The requirement of TBP for skeletal muscle differentiation prompted us to further analyze the dynamics of the PIC assembly on muscle promoters during C2C12 myoblast-to-myotube differentiation

. Our findings that TBP/TFIID is functional in muscle progenitors and their differentiated progeny are in agreement with earlier studies showing that TBP was able to bind the MyoD promoter in a TATA-dependent manner ( Leibham et al., 1994 ). It has been also shown that MyoD efficiently stimulated TFIID-dependent basal transcription ( Heller and Bengal, 1998; Dilworth, 2004 )

., 2007; Deato and Tjian, 2007 ). In particular, it was recently suggested that during skeletal muscle differentiation, canonical TFIID is replaced by a complex consisting of TBP2 ( also termed TRF3 = TBP-related factor 3; gene name Tbpl2 = TATA box binding protein like 2 ) and TAF3, which is required for activation of muscle genes ( Deato and Tjian, 2007; Deato et al., 2008 )

. We have quantified the differentiation index, the percentage of nuclei within myotubes of differentiated C2C12, to illustrate better the impaired differentiation potential of C2C12 in the absence of TBP ( Figure 3B ). mRNA analysis of skeletal muscle specific genes Myog, Ckm and Acta1 demonstrates an impaired activation of the skeletal muscle program in the absence of TBP ( Figure 3D )

. Thus, our data demonstrate the direct involvement of TBP in nucleating PIC assembly at MyoD-regulated skeletal muscle promoters during muscle differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 009Figure 5. TBP is recruited to muscle genes upon muscle differentiation

. TBP and RNAPII-S5P were not detected on these promoters in proliferating myoblasts, when the muscle genes are inactive ( Figure 5 ), further supporting the evidence that TBP drives MyoD-mediated activation of muscle-specific gene transcription during muscle differentiation. TBP and RNAPII-S5P were present on the constitutively active Gapdh promoter in myoblasts and myotubes, but not on transcriptionally silent loci such as the Sox2 promoter and the Igh enhancer ( Figure 5 )

. Thus, although TBP levels are reduced in myotubes compared to myoblasts under physiological conditions ( Deato and Tjian, 2007 ), near complete TBP elimination impairs muscle differentiation. We conclude that TBP is required for skeletal muscle differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 006Figure 3. TBP is required for myoblast differentiation into myotubes. ( A ) Representative images of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation into myotubes upon TBP downregulation

. We could detect the TBP2 protein ( Figure 2B ) and Tbpl2 transcript ( Figure 2C ) in C2C12 myotubes only upon ectopic expression of Tbpl2. Importantly, the ectopic Tbpl2 expression in C2C12s did not affect the formation of myotubes and the expression levels of muscle differentiation genes, such as Myog and Ckm ( Figure 2C ). The data we present here demonstrate that Tbpl2 is not expressed during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes

. Since TBP levels were reported to be significantly decreased during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes ( Deato and Tjian, 2007; Zhou et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015 ), while TBP2 is absent in differentiating myotubes ( data reported here ), we tested the hypothesis that T2 does not replace TBP during myogenic differentiation as previously proposed ( De and Tjian 2007 ).

    Title: Targeted cortical reorganization using optogenetics in non-human primates
    Abstract: Brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity. While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation, the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored. We studied stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in two macaques. A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocorticographic recording across primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2016 ). We tracked two measures of network connectivity, the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes; these were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

   . 037; see Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ). These results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network. These findings are well explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity.

. Next, we investigate how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within cortical areas. We then test whether stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner. The goal of this work is to investigate large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation, which will inform future neurorehabilitation strategies.

. This work takes advantage of a large-scale optogenetic interface ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2016 ) that enables us to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale μ-electrocorticography ( μ-ECoG ) activity across two brain areas, S1 and M1. We first establish and compare two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity

. Given that Hebbian rules have been used extensively to explain synaptic plasticity, we wanted to explore the idea that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity. The strongest test of the Hebbian model is to compare the correlations directly induced by stimulation with the changes in network correlations observed after conditioning. Our ability to record artifact-free signals during stimulation allowed us to perform this test

. Despite these differences, both appear to support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity. Still, a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require a study of intermediate time-frames as well, along with detailed cortical mapping. These are important questions for future work. The large-scale interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations

., 2013; Rebesco et al., 2010; Song et al., 2013 ) or paired electrical stimulation ( Rebesco and Miller, 2011; Seeman et al., 2017 ) can lead to plastic changes in both primate and rodent cortex. Here we demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation at even a single location strengthens inter-area functional connectivity between brain areas. A similar observation was reported for one session of single-site electrical stimulation ( Seeman et al., 2017 )

. While stimulation-induced long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and STDP have been observed within local circuits ( Iriki et al., 1989; Feldman, 2012; Shulz and Jacob, 2010 ), and have been posited as the mechanism of stimulation-induced plasticity within M1 ( Lajoie et al., 2017 ) this is the first study explaining large-scale changes across cortical networks. Notably, conditioning drove increases in coherence between S1 and M1 only in the theta band ( 4–8 Hz )

We quantified inter-area functional connectivity between S1 and M1 using two different measures—one based on the network response to optogenetic stimulation and the other based on spontaneous neural activity. The first measure focused on how the response to optical stimulation propagates through the network. Optogenetic stimulation in S1 and M1 evoked responses across both cortical areas, and we characterized these responses according to their amplitudes and delays ( Figure 2A and E )

. The temporal dynamics of both measures reveal a trend of increasing inter-area connectivity throughout the experiment. This trend suggests that neuroplastic changes start almost immediately after the start of stimulation. Interestingly, we observed unlearning of the stimulation-induced changes during passive recording, though some of the stimulation-induced changes persisted

., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013 ). Continuous reinforcement of this artificial connection led to a stable functional change in stimulation-evoked movements, indicating that stimulation induces large-scale plasticity. Recently these results were reproduced in a modeling work at the network level ( Lajoie et al., 2017 ). Similar results have been observed using open-loop stimulation protocols to induce targeted plasticity between two cortical sites ( Rebesco and Miller, 2011; Seeman et al

. Implementing such treatments requires a better understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network connectivity and network dynamics. The simple Hebbian model of plasticity ( Donald, 1949 ) and spike-timing dependent versions of it ( Bi and Poo, 2001 ) explain a large body of data on activity-dependent plasticity, including both in vitro ( Massobrio et al., 2015; Abrahamsson et al., 2016 ), and in vivo ( Andersen et al

., 2016 ), and in vivo ( Andersen et al., 2017; Feldman, 2012; Shulz and Jacob, 2010 ) studies. Despite the extensive work studying Hebbian plasticity at the cellular level, it remains unclear how synaptic plasticity leads to large-scale functional reorganization. Recently, several studies have shown large-scale plasticity following brain stimulation that is consistent with Hebbian mechanisms ( Jackson et al., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013; Seeman et al., 2017; Nishimura et al

., 2017 ). Notably, these papers have reported off-target effects, but these were either interpreted as global changes in excitability or were not explained. Although the results from closed-loop and open-loop experiments suggest large-scale plasticity, the underlying neural network changes remain unexplored. Here, we measure connectivity across sensorimotor cortex and track changes in network connectivity in response to open-loop stimulation

., 2012; Bastos and Schoffelen, 2015 ). We calculated the coherence between the site of stimulation and the secondary sites across different frequency bands. Because SERR and coherence are derived independently from recordings with and without simultaneous stimulation, they might reflect fundamentally different aspects of network connectivity. Therefore, in each experiment we compared these two measures prior to conditioning stimulation

. We next evaluated the fine-scale effects of conditioning across the entire network. Since SERR is restricted to connectivity from the stimulation site, this analysis was conducted using only changes in pairwise coherence. Figure 6A shows data from an example session, with connectivity changes represented as a set of heatmaps: the heatmap at each recording site represents the change in pairwise coherence between that electrode and all of the other electrodes

Functional connectivity between M1 and S1 has been demonstrated in fMRI ( Matsui et al., 2011; McGregor and Gribble, 2015 ), electrophysiology ( Iriki et al., 1989; Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2016; Prsa et al., 2017 ), and anatomical studies ( Kosar et al., 1985; Petrof et al., 2015 ). To evaluate stimulation-induced changes across these areas we investigated two measures of functional connectivity, one based on stimulation and one based on natural neural processing

. The two measures of functional connectivity were highly correlated: across sessions, the distribution of regression slopes was significantly different from 0 ( t-test: p=3. 73e-06 ), and 69 percent of individual experiments showed significant linear regressions ( p<0. 05 ). This finding indicates that at baseline, before any conditioning, the stimulation-evoked response reflects network dynamics across the frequency spectrum

. However, this decrease in the correlation between the measures after conditioning seems to be limited to high frequencies and may reflect a transient instability of the network due to the stimulation-induced perturbations in connectivity. Previous work has demonstrated that either activity dependent ( Jackson et al., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013; Nishimura et al., 2013; Rebesco et al., 2010; Song et al

., 2017; Nishimura et al., 2013; Rebesco and Miller, 2011; Rebesco et al., 2010; Song et al., 2013; Lajoie et al., 2017 ). In particular, Fetz and colleagues implemented an activity-dependent stimulation protocol, effectively introducing an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex ( Jackson et al., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013 )

In this study, we used a large optogenetic interface ( Yazdan-Shmor et al. 2016 ) to stimulate populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale μ-ECo activity across S1 and M1. This allowed us to investigate the effects of stimulation on functional connectivity between these areas. Our results show that stimulation-induced changes in functional connectivity between S and M1 are consistent with Hebbian plasticity. This is the first demonstration of Hebb plasticity in large-scale networks, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation

The results demonstrate a relationship between stimulation-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network. These are explained by a Hebb model of large-scale stimulation plasticity. Next, we investigate how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within areas. We test whether stimulation-evoked drives large-scale plasticity in a Hebb manner. The goal is to investigate large functional reorganization following stimulation, which will inform neurorehab strategies. This work takes advantage of a large optogen interface ( Yaz-Shmor et al 2016 ) that enables simultaneous stimulation populations excitatory neurons recording large μCo activity across brain S and M. First, we establish two measures functional that provide complementary views plasticity. Given Hebb have been used extensively explain synaptic plasticity, we explore idea large stimulation changes consistent Hebb plastic. The test Hebb model is compare correlations induced stimulation with changes network observed. Our ability record-free signals stimulation allowed perform this test Despite differences, both support key role Hebb sensorimotor plastic. Still, deeper understanding relationship require study intermediate timeframes detailed cortical. These important future work.

    Title: Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with substantial, naturally occurring damage to primary visual cortex
    Abstract: Lesions of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) lead to loss of conscious visual perception with significant impact on human patients. Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods. In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque ( monkey S ), likely born without V1, the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S, while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.

    Supporting Text:
   . Visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in monkey S with little evidence of atrophy. This suggests a role in residual visual function, consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas that was comparable to control monkeys. While the structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, the microstructure was intact

. For instance, it is conceivable that the heavily enlarged, fluid-filled ventricles within the visual cortex that formed the lesion could have differentially affected the pattern of action of anaesthesia in monkey S. Figure 6 showed no significant V5/MT activation in monkey S to either checkerboard or moving dots stimuli, so to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT, we performed a connectivity analysis

. Given the significantly weakened tract between V5/MT and subcortical nuclei indicated by the diffusion imaging, there is little evidence to suggest that a strengthening of these connections underlies whatever residual vision was present in monkey S. Residual vision can manifest in several different ways, including the ability to determine information from faces, as shown in patient TN ( Burra et al., 2013 ), a function that has been suggested to survive loss of V1

. Nevertheless, for visual motion stimuli we saw in monkey S foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD. Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses, it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT

., 2013; Goodale, 2011 ). Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to the anaesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities

., 2015; Arcaro et al., 2018 ), but also a number of children who acquired lesions congenitally or through perinatal stroke ( Mundinano et al., 2017 ). The presence of residual visual function suggests that functional visual networks can develop or be sustained in the absence of the main visual input to cortex. In monkeys, in the absence of primary visual cortex, a number of potential pathways have been proposed to convey visual information from the eyes to extrastriate visual cortex

. Earlier MRI studies in V1-lesioned monkeys have shown parallel activation in early visual areas, like V2, V3 and V4 as well as V5/MT ( Schmid et al., 2010 ). It has been suggested that V2 might be a crucial contribution to visual function and awareness ( Merigan et al., 1993 ). These visual cortical areas also receive direct subcortical input ( Wong-Riley, 1976; Kaas and Lyon, 2007 )

. Our aim here was to use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to determine the integrity of the structural and functional networks underlying residual visual function in this monkey with a long-standing anatomical lesion of primary visual cortex.

. However, for monkey S, looking through the whole brain ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ), we find only few regions with significant activation. A further challenge in monkey S is that the damage is bilateral. In much of the previous work in humans, the sighted hemisphere has been used as a control area, therefore controlling for any global variation in activation levels

. This would be expected since both sides of the brain received the same visual stimulation. In addition to the STS, a large swathe of dorsal extrastriate cortex and parietal areas showed significant correlation, both in the control monkeys and in monkey S. Finally, the network connected to V5/MT included the Frontal Eye Fields ( FEF ) in monkey S and all control monkeys. This connectivity analysis was also performed using the LGN and the pulvinar as a seed

. This was very similar in monkey S and the control monkeys, suggesting that this inter-cortical activity in the macaque visual brain was not affected by the loss of V1. Interestingly, none of the monkeys included LGN in this functional network, perhaps reflecting the weak anatomical connectivity between these areas in typical animals ( Sincich et al., 2004 )

. Macaque monkeys who received a unilateral V1 lesion at two months of age exhibited more residual vision as adults than monkeys who received their lesions in adulthood ( Moore et al., 1996 ). Cortical blindness due to bilateral damage to the primary visual cortex of humans is fortunately rare. There are a few cases of damage acquired in adulthood, some of whom have been extensively studied ( de Gelder et al., 2008; Hervais-Adelman et al., 2015; Arcaro et al

., 2012; Mars et al., 2013 ). Figure 8 shows the regions of the cortex with a pattern of BOLD activation that was significantly correlated to the time-series signal extracted from V5/MT on the right side of the brain when the monkey was shown the moving dot stimulus. The nature of the analysis ensured that V5/MT in the right hemisphere must have a significant correlation, but clearly the two hemispheres had similar connectivity as the pattern of activation we found was bilateral

Primary visual cortex ( V1 ) of primates is the major gateway for feedforward input of visual information from the retina via the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) into a network of over 30 extrastriate visual areas ( Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Markov et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2018 )

. Thus, unlike adult-acquired lesions, there appeared to be a maintenance of structural integrity of the visual system when V1 is damaged neonatally. This may explain the increased residual function both, in monkey S and in children with early damage to the visual cortex.

. This gross pathology of the cerebral cortex was most likely to have been acquired developmentally or perinatally. Previous data have implicated roles in residual vision for the LGN, pulvinar, SC and the extrastriate visual cortical networks including motion area V5/MT

. Furthermore, extrastriate visual area V5/MT appeared to have a similar functional connectivity profile to this area as observed in control monkeys. The cortical activation evoked by visual stimulation was variable in all the monkeys, so to investigate the connection between V5/MT and visual subcortical structures, we performed probabilistic tractography on diffusion-weighted images

. Based on our knowledge of functional representations, the activation of face patches in temporal cortex discussed above must be driven by a visual subcortical input other than to V5/MT. Since it is likely to be a wider pattern of cortical activation that underpins visual awareness and behaviour ( e. g. Papanikolaou et al., 2019 ), it might be supported by a wider pattern of weak, parallel subcortical inputs directly to extrastriate visual cortex

., 2018; Bridge et al., 2010 ). Thus, the lack of consistent activation in V5/MT in monkey S and some controls suggests a suppressive effect of the anaesthetic, which was most evident with larger doses of the volatile anaesthetic. Also, drifting eye movements and inappropriate ocular accommodation under anaesthesia could have affected the functional activation we measured

. Considering all the evidence, it appears that the dorsal visual network was intact, and would have the potential to support active vision ( Koyama et al., 2004; Davare et al., 2011 ), as seen in a number of human patients with damage to the visual cortical system ( Goodale and Milner, 1992; Bridge et al., 2013; Goodale, 2011 )

    Provide a **formal summary** of the article in 200-600 words. **Do not include explanations, self-referring to the text**

    A monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1) exhibited unremarkable behavior, but impaired visual task performance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal structures outside the lesion. Visual stimulation activated the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Functional analysis showed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas correlated with V/MT activation without V1. Despite subcortical responses, there was little evidence for strengthened subort input to V/MT supporting residual function or blinds-like phenomena.

Visual structures outside the lesion remained intact, suggesting a role in residual function. The network of extrastate visual areas was comparable to controls. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak but microstructure intact. The ventricles within the lesion may have affected anaesthesia pattern. V/MT showed no activation to checkerboard or moving stimuli. Connectivity analysis showed weakened tract between V/ and subort nuclei. Residual vision can manifest in different ways, including face information determination.

A network of cortical areas showed similar BOLD response to V/MT. Retinal information may reach dorsal areas via LG and pular, but lack of activation due to anaesthesia. Pathways between LG-V/MT and pular-V/MT were similar in monkey and controls. Residual function suggests networks can develop or sustain without main input cortex. Potential pathways convey information from eyes to extrate cortex. MRI showed activation in early areas V2, V3, V4, and V/MT in V-lesioned monkeys. V2 may be crucial for function awareness. Cortical areas receive subort input.

The study aimed to determine structural and functional networks underlying residual function in a monkey with long-standing V lesion. The brain showed few regions with activation. A challenge was bilateral damage. The network to VMT included Frontal Eye Fields in monkey and controls. Connectivity was similar in monkey and controls, suggesting intercort activity not affected by loss V. LG was not included in network, reflecting weak connectivity. Monkeys with V lesion at two months showed more residual vision than adults. Cortical blindness due to bilateral damage is rare. There are cases acquired in adulthood, some extensively studied.

    Title: The innate immune sensor IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus by scanning along the duplex
    Abstract: The ability to recognize foreign double-stranded ( ds ) DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment is an essential defense mechanism of the human innate immune system. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus are not understood. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, we show that the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.

    Supporting Text:
   . Nucleosomes are tagged with fluorescent anti-H4 ( Atto488, blue ). Most nucleosomes co-localize with IFI16, indicating that they are efficiently blocking 1D-diffusion by IFI16. This video is related to Figure 4. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 018 The molecular mechanism by which innate immune sensors distinguish self from foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus has been a major unresolved question in innate immunology ( Kerur et al

., 2014; Orzalli et al., 2013 ). By using time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we demonstrate here that IFI16 ID scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly. In vivo, this 1D scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens

. The interferon-inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) is a key innate immune sensor that detects foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm ( Unterholzner et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011; Orzalli et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 1A ). IFI16 plays a central role in defense against a number of pathogens ( e. g herpes simplex virus-1 ) ( Unterholzner et al., 2010; Johnson et al

. Here, we report the observation of a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves these central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways. 10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 003Figure 1. IFI16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA. ( A ) Top: IFI16 is composed of three functional domains flanked by unstructured linkers, namely one pyrin domain ( PYD ) and two dsDNA-binding Hin domains ( HinA and HinB; Hin: hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigen )

., 2010 ). Thus, we propose that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses. It has long been speculated that chromatinization acts as the key feature that allows IFI16 to distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus ( Kerur et al., 2011; Unterholzner and Bowie, 2011; Li et al., 2012; Orzalli et al., 2012; 2013; Johnson et at

., 2012; 2013; Johnson et at., 2014 ) ; IFI16 oligomerizes on exposed invading foreign-dsDNA before it becomes hetero-chromatinized. Previous in vivo work demonstrated that transfected chromatinized SV40 DNA is able to evade IFI16 oligomerization and downstream responses ( Orzalli et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which IFI16 could use chromatinization to distinguish self from nonself has yet to be identified

., 1983 ), these results directly support the hypothesis that chromatinization is a key deterrent for preventing the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on self-dsDNA. 10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 012Figure 3. Nucleosomes inhibit oligomerization. ( A ) A cartoon of di-nucleosome constructs with varying dsDNA-spacers. ( B ) Competition binding assays using IFI16 bound FAM-labeled 70-bp dsDNA against various di-nucleosomes and naked dsDNA

. In combination with 3D sampling of binding sites on a collapsed DNA molecule, this process optimizes the oligomerization and downstream signaling time. While the clustering on dsDNA presents a tempting explanation for the role of IFI16 in viral gene silencing, future in vivo experiments await to test this. IFI16 belongs to the family of AIM2-like receptors, which include other nuclear and cytosolic foreign dsDNA-sensors

., 2010; Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011; Orzalli et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, persistent IFI16 signaling is associated with autoimmunity ( e. g. Sjögren’s syndrome ) ( Mondini et al., 2007; Choubey et al., 2010; Mondini et al., 2010; Gugliesi et al., 2013; Smith and Jefferies, 2014 ). The molecular mechanisms by which IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA remain unknown

. Without the antibody, the motion of IFI16 was still confined, whereas for bare λdsDNA, IFI16 moved with a high processivity along the entire strand ( Figures 4B, C, and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ). These observations are consistent with the bulk experiments ( Figure 3 ), and confirm that nucleosomes directly restrict the 1D diffusion of IFI16 and consequently limit the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on dsDNA. 10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 014Figure 4

., 2011; Unterholzner and Bowie, 2011; Li et al., 2012; 2013; Orzalli et al., 2012; 2013; Johnson et al., 2014 ). The oligomerization of IFI16 on under-chromatinized foreign DNA plays a key role not only in initiating inflammatory and antiviral responses, ( Monroe et al., 2014; Orzalli et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011 ), but also in regulating the hetero-chromatinization and silencing of viral dsDNA ( Johnson et al., 2014; Orzalli et al., 2013 )

. To directly address this issue, we first used a competition-binding assay to investigate how IFI16 interacts with dsDNA fragments containing two nucleosomes with varying spacer sizes ( 6, 30, 50, and 70 bps; Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Here, di-nucleosomes with 6-, 30-, and 50-bp spacer failed to compete against IFI16-bound FAM-labeled 70-bp dsDNA, ( Figure 3B )

. To establish a functional signaling platform, IFI16 must overcome two challenges. First, individual IFI16 molecules must be able to locate one another on large pathogen genomes with sizes ranging from 105 to 106 base pairs ( bps ). Second and more importantly, this assembly mechanism can only take place on foreign dsDNA and must be inhibited on host dsDNA ( Figure 1A )

. The host counters this infection strategy in the nucleus by directly assembling supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on invading foreign DNA, but not on its own genomic material ( Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011 )

. In addition, longer DNA substrates work no longer as antennae, but as traps, since individual IFI16 molecules are farther apart and thus less likely to encounter one another ( Hu et al., 2006; Turkin et al., 2015; 2016 ). Overall, the results of our bulk and single-molecule experiments are consistent with the dsDNA-size dependent binding in vitro ( Morrone et al., 2014 ), which also correlates with the IFI16-induced inflammatory responses in vivo ( Unterholzner et al., 2010 )

. 0. Labeled antibodies were negatively tested against bare DNA and Ifi16 clusters in the microscopy assay, and showed high specificity for nucleosomal DNA preparations only. λ-DNA templates, loaded with nucleosomes and tagged with anti-H4, were constantly stretched in the flow channel. Ifi16 co-localized strongly with the nucleosome signal ( Video 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )

To identify the mechanisms underlying assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on DNA, we used a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques. We show that IF16 one-dimensionally scans exposed dsDNA to assemble into supram signaling platforms and that chromatin prevents IF16 from targeting hostDNA by interfering with 1-diffusion. This unique scanning-assisted mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish from foe and assemble oligomers efficiently on foreignDNA.

    Title: Determining composition of micron-scale protein deposits in neurodegenerative disease by spatially targeted optical microproteomics
    Abstract: Spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) is a novel proteomics technique for interrogating micron-scale regions of interest ( ROIs ) in mammalian tissue, with no requirement for genetic manipulation. Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0. 67 µm in the xy-plane and 1. 48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.

    Supporting Text:
   . Gel electrophoresis of the indiscriminately photo-tagged proteins reveals a very different pattern of protein bands compared to the specimen in which amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis ( Figure 1D ). The total volume of tissue that needs to be photo-tagged to obtain sufficient material for mass spectrometry analysis is a subjective matter and also depends on instrument sensitivity, fixation method used, sample complexity and perhaps other factors

. We have developed a semi-automated technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ), which combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry. While two-photon excitation has previously been used to drive microscopic, 3D-resolved photochemistry ( Lee et al

. Note that the predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample is Aβ ( arrow ), which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment because of its low overall abundance. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09579. 003 The photo-tagging procedure uses two-photon microscopy ( Skoch et al., 2006 ) rather than conventional confocal microscopy

., 2008 ), STOMP represents the first application of this technique to affinity photolabeling, offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art LCM. In addition to providing clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease, this new proteomic technique also has great potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification

In STOMP, laser light from the microscope is used not only to image the fluorescently stained specimen, but also to photochemically crosslink affinity purification ligands to protein components within pathological deposits ( Figure 1A ). The photo-affinity ligand or photo-tag used here is a peptide of sequence: 4-benzoylbenzyl-Gly-His-His-His-His-His-His-CONH2 ( 6HisBP ) ( Figure 1B ). Benzoylbenzene is a photoreactive group that forms covalent bonds with C–H and N–H groups upon excitation

. Slides were imaged by confocal microscopy to identify ThS-positive amyloid deposits. Confocal images of ThS-positive amyloid deposits ( Figure 1C1 ) were used to construct individual masks ( Figure 1C2 ). Because our technique hinges on selective photolabeling and purification, we needed to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP in ambient light and under immunofluorescence excitation, as well as non-specific binding to affinity purification beads

. Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue section with anti-His6 antibody after photo-activation superimposes on the digital mask, thus highlighting the very high accuracy of targeting of the two-photon laser ( Figure 1C3 ). STOMP combines microscopy with selective photo-labeling to accurately resolve, capture, and affinity-label highly irregular shaped micron-scale structures, via a semi-automated procedure

., 2004 ). The highly specific nature of STOMP protein labeling and recovery permits very sensitive detection of proteins present in plaques, even if those proteins are also abundant in the remainder of the brain. We have shown that the STOMP technique can be used to determine the proteomic composition of micron-scale microscopic features. The procedure does not require large quantities of tissue and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time

. Based on our determination of the resolution of STOMP, regions of interest ( ROIs ) as small as 0. 38 µm can be analyzed ( Figure 2 ). To analyze such small features, however, sufficient numbers of ROIs must be captured, and this may necessitate pooling photo-tagged material from several tissue sections. Protein identification via mass spectrometry involved on-bead digestion of the photo-tagged proteins with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by trypsin and LC-MS/MS analysis

. A custom software macro was written that reads the mask file and selectively delivers two-photon excitation light to each protein deposit present, while leaving the remainder of the specimen untouched by excitation light ( the custom macro is available as Source code 1 ). The STOMP macro provides a semi-automated tool for photo-tagging proteins in pathological deposits. Importantly, unlike LCM, no manual tracing of features is required with STOMP. 10. 7554/eLife. 09579. 004Figure 2

. All were found to be present and are apparently genuine components of the amyloid plaque ( Figure 3 ). Optical sectioning demonstrates the presence of each of these proteins in the core of the amyloid plaques suggesting they were incorporated at the earliest stages of plaque formation

. Senile plaques from brain sections of a severe case of AD were visualized with ThS and photo-tagged using a procedure identical to that used for the TgCRND8 tissue. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein composition of these senile plaques identified 60 proteins that were statistically significantly enriched, with Aβ being the most abundant protein component ( Table 2 )

. To establish the spatial resolution limits of our photo-tagging procedure, we tagged single-voxel spots within sections of methanol-fixed murine brain tissue. By subsequently staining the tissue with an anti-hexahistidine antibody, we were able to use confocal immunofluorescence imaging to directly visualize and measure the extent of the photo-tagged volume. We measured the diameter ( full width at half-maximum, FWHM ) of the phototagged volume at 0. 67 µm along the x and y axes, and 1

. Many of these approaches have been brought to bear on amyloid ( senile ) plaques in AD brain tissue, in an attempt to identify core components, if any, in addition to Aβ. Early LCM studies utilizing 2D gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry have detected a modest number of plaque-associated proteins, including an assortment of proteins associated with cell signaling, chaperone function, membrane trafficking, and proteolysis ( Liao et al., 2004 )

. Greater amounts of tissue will increase sensitivity and enable identification of lower abundance proteins, particularly in very complex samples containing a large number of unique proteins. In this study, we were able to identify proteins present in relative abundance in the pathological feature being examined using a total photo-tagged volume of approximately 2 × 106 µm3

. The width of the peaks is 0. 67 µm in x and y, and 1. 48 µm along the z axis, corresponding to an ellipsoidal excited volume of 0. 38 µm3.

. Identifying deposit-associated soluble proteins could further our understanding of disease mechanisms. A different strategy that can preserve some of the deposit-associated soluble proteins is laser capture microdissection ( LCM ), in which protein deposits are lifted intact out of sections of the fixed specimen; their protein composition is then analyzed by mass spectrometry. However, LCM requires manual tracing of the feature of interest, which can be time-consuming and prone to error.

    Title: Frizzled3 controls axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons
    Abstract: Disruption of the Frizzled3 ( Fz3 ) gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus, and, in contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants, Fz3−/− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. These experiments implicate planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling in motor axon growth and they highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell–cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth.

   . In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LMCL axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies.

. We next asked whether the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in the VIIth, XIIth, phrenic, and dorsal limb nerves in Fz3−/− mice is: ( 1 ) defective motor neuron differentiation, ( 2 ) excessive motor neuron death, or ( 3 ) defective axon growth and/or guidance. Since the vast majority of Fz3−/− motor axons do not appear to follow erroneous trajectories ( Figures 1A, A′, and 4 ), aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be relevant

. 5 and E13. 5 is an active process and is independent of the motor axon’s ultimate target. One class of models that could account for the precocious motor neuron death in Fz3−/− embryos invokes the existence of neuronal survival factors produced by intermediate targets along an axon’s trajectory, as suggested by in vitro co-culture experiments with spinal cord commissural axons and floor plate tissue ( Wang and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999 )

. 5, there is an analogous wave of precocious motor neuron death that is not observed in Fz3+/− controls ( Figure 5H–K′ ). Thus, in Fz3−/− embryos a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11. 5-E12. 5

. A corollary to this argument is that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons. In earlier work, Fz3−/−, and Celsr3−/− forebrains were found to have essentially identical defects in multiple axon tracts ( Wang et al., 2002, 2006b; Tissir et al., 2005 ), and in Fz3−/−, Celsr3−/−, and Vangl2Lp/Lp spinal cords the commissural axons of dorsal horn sensory neurons were found to exhibit the same rostral turning defect ( Lyuksyutova et al

. While the precocious cell death of Fz3−/− motor neurons can be rescued by eliminating Bax, the axon stalling phenotype remains unchanged. This observation is consistent with a model in which a defect in Fz3-dependent axonal growth induces apoptotic cell death, and it argues against an alternate model in which Fz3 functions in some other process to maintain cell viability, with defective axonal growth representing a secondary effect of the neuron’s impending demise

. In light of the essential role of Fz3 in the development of subsets of cranial motor neurons, we evaluated the role of Fz3 in the development of spinal motor neurons that innervate the limbs, a set for which the axonal projection patterns have been well defined ( De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008; Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010 ). NF immunostaining of E11. 5-E13

. 2011; Sasselli et al., 2013 ). In the present work, we have identified a hitherto unrecognized role for Fz3 in the growth of motor axons. Using conventional and conditional loss-of-function alleles for Fz3, we show that Fz3 is required for a subset of cranial and spinal motor axons to grow to their peripheral targets

., 2002, 2006b ). Fz3 appears to be part of a system that provides directional information to growing axons, as indicated by the observation that in Fz3−/− embryos commissural sensory axons in the spinal cord orient randomly instead of turning rostrally after midline crossing ( Lyuksyutova et al., 2003 ). Virtually identical CNS axon phenotypes are observed in embryos lacking Celsr3, one of three mammalian homologues of the core PCP protein Flamingo/Starry Night ( Tissir et al

. To eliminate Fz3 expression exclusively in CNS neurons, we controlled recombination with an Olig2Cre knock-in allele and found that Olig2Cre/+;Fz3CKO/− mice exhibit the complete spectrum of motor neuron phenotypes shown by Fz3−/− mice: ( 1 ) VIIth nerve axons do not form the well-defined C-shaped tract looping around the VIth cranial nerve nucleus ( Figure 6A, A′ ) ; ( 2 ) the XIIth cranial nerve is markedly thinned and fails to innervate the tongue at E13

. However, we note that the conceptualization of axon growth and path-finding as distinct behaviors may be simplistic, since the two attributes could be related mechanistically if axon growth is dependent on the same signals that guide the path-finding process. During normal embryonic development, motor axons compete for limited quantities of survival factors produced by their skeletal muscle targets, with the result that in the prenatal mouse >50% of motor neurons die beginning at E13

. In Fz3−/− embryos, other classes of spinal motor axons appear to be unaffected, including medial motor column and hypaxial motor column axons that innervate axial muscles and body wall muscles, respectively ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ). Although Fz3 is widely expressed in the mouse spinal cord and brainstem, it appears to be uniquely required by only a subset of motor neurons

. Taken together, these data imply that in spinal motor neurons the primary phenotype resulting from loss of Fz3 is a defect in the growth of LMCL axons. Since apoptosis is restricted to precisely those motor neurons that exhibit defective axonal growth and since the axonal growth defect is not secondary to apoptosis of LMCL neurons, it seems very likely that the chain of causality leads from the axonal growth defect to apoptosis

. 5, when most DRG axons are still far from their final targets, it is likely that intermediate targets are a major source of survival signals. The similar distributions along the spinal cord of dorsal clusters and delayed apoptosis suggested the possibility that in the lumber region of Fz3−/− embryos there may be an initial reduction in the number of NC cells arriving at the DRG, leading to decreased competition for peripheral targets and higher rates of survival of DRG neurons

. The affected axons derive from motor neurons in the ventral motor column of the spinal cord, which innervate the limb muscles of the hindlimb and forelimb. In Fz−/−, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the plexus, in contrast to the phenotypes of other axon-finding mutants, F−− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories.

The article discusses the role of Frizzled3 (F3) in controlling axonal development in cranial and spinal motor neurons.

    Title: Functional evaluation of transposable elements as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells
    Abstract: Transposable elements ( TEs ) are thought to have helped establish gene regulatory networks. Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted TEs as enhancers, but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation. Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs.

    Supporting Text:
   . Yet other TEs play only minor, redundant or no role in gene regulation, despite strong correlative evidence at the level of chromatin composition and conformation. To test in a single experiment the regulatory roles of multiple TE+ enhancers in ESCs we performed CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) targeted at RLTR13D6 elements

. These data are in line with the chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development. However, it is also possible for the correlations observed here to emerge in the absence of causal links between TEs and gene expression. To directly test for a functional role of TE+ enhancers in gene regulation, we performed CRISPR-mediated genetic excision of selected TEs

. To validate the relatively small effect of some TE+ enhancers on gene expression, we performed additional genetic editing experiments. We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed >2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, D ), but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3B, E )

. Here we have tested the gene regulatory function of specific TE families in ESCs and TSCs using genetic and epigenetic editing approaches, and compared them with predictions from extensive analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data. We identify a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes

., 2018 ). Extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements. In a contrasting example to our findings, epigenetic editing work by the Wysocka lab has revealed that a large proportion of LTR5Hs elements play significant roles in the regulation of nearly 300 genes in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line ( Fuentes et al., 2018 )

. These results suggest that only a small minority of RLTR13D6 elements play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs. This is in contrast with the broader correlations found by analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data in wildtype cells, highlighting the need to establish causal roles via direct molecular manipulation of TEs.

., 2017; Percharde et al., 2018 ). Finally, work from embryonic and trophoblast stem cells ( ESCs and TSCs, respectively ), suggests a divergence in TE regulatory activity that is concomitant with the separation of the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage ( Kunarso et al., 2010; Chuong et al., 2013 ). In ESCs, TE families such as RLTR13D6 bind key ESC TFs ( e. g., OCT4, NANOG ), whereas a distinct subset ( e. g

. However, the effects seen here from silencing 34 ( 44% ) of these copies suggest that regulatory RLTR13D6 elements would likely remain a minority. Another explanation to the differences between LTR5Hs and RLTR13D6 action is that the regulatory effects of TEs are variable between families and cellular contexts. Indeed, other TEs considered here and whose effects we did not test by CRISPRi ( RLTR9, RLTR13D5, RLTR13B ), may play important roles in ESC and TSC gene regulation

., 2010 ). In the absence of a substantial contribution of ESC TE+ enhancers to gene regulation, the striking correlations emerging from profiling efforts most likely reflect the fact that TE insertions are best tolerated in regions where their tissue-specific enhancer action matches the expression profiles of nearby genes. Whilst the enhancer activity of these TEs could be inconsequential for gene expression, this genomic ‘safe niche’ would be permissive for fixation by genetic drift

. In this respect, mammalian preimplantation development is a seemingly well exploited context for TE expansion, driving genetic conflicts with the host, as well as creating opportunities for TE exaptation ( Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla, 2018 ). In the mouse, TE-derived regulatory activity has been implicated at multiple stages of preimplantation development

. As expected, RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements only displayed enhancer-like profiles in ESCs and not in TSCs, whereas the reverse was true for RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements ( Figure 1C ). To confirm that TE+ enhancers display a similar lineage asymmetry in vivo and assess the timing of enhancer activation, we analysed two ATAC-seq datasets from pre- and post-implantation embryos ( Wu et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2017 )

. For the remainder of the targeted TEs, although as a group the associated genes displayed a significant downregulation upon CRISPRi, these changes were limited to at most 1. 4-fold ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). This included genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displaying a similar or greater H3K27ac loss to that observed at Tdrd12- or Spp1-associated RLTR13D6 elements

. The use of genetic and epigenetic editing tools as presented here, and also used by other labs ( Chuong et al., 2016; Jachowicz et al., 2017; Fuentes et al., 2018 ), initiate a much needed move to evaluating causal roles for TEs in gene regulation

. Given the tight tissue specificity of TE+ enhancer profiles that we described above ( Figure 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ), we asked whether genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displayed lineage-specific expression. We first compared their expression in ESCs and TSCs and found a bias towards the cell type where the interacting TEs display enhancer profiles ( Figure 3C )

. Smarcad1 knockout mice are subviable, displaying growth defects and low fertility ( Schoor et al., 1999 ). It remains to be seen whether the activity of the RLTR9E element we identified plays any role in these phenotypes, possibly by affecting early embryonic differentiation ( Hong et al., 2009 ). Other genes that we found to be regulated by TEs are not essential for development: both Map3k8 ( Dumitru et al., 2000 ) or Spp1 ( Rittling et al

., 2018 ). Notably, in the latter study virtually all H3K27ac-marked LTR5Hs elements were inactivated by CRISPRi ( 257 copies, according to our own analysis ), probably due to the use of twelve sgRNAs simultaneously ( Fuentes et al., 2018 ). It is therefore possible that more efficient targeting of all H3K27ac-marked RLTR13D6 elements ( 76 copies ) in mouse ESCs would uncover additional regulatory elements

., 2016 ), we first identified 98 TEs with biased chromatin accessibility signal across the two genetic backgrounds, suggestive of allele-specific enhancer activity. This included five elements that were polymorphic between 129 and Cast ( according to structural variation data from the Mouse Genomes Project ), as well as elements present in both species but bearing sequence variation. We then analysed RNA-seq data from the same cell line ( Gendrel et al

. However, our data suggest that these constitute a minority of all the putative TE-derived enhancers identified through bioinformatic analyses, highlighting the importance of functional tests when assessing the contribution of TEs to gene regulatory networks.

. Based on the bioinformatic analyses above, we chose a set of 4 TEs in ESCs and 2 TEs in TSCs that display strong evidence of enhancer activity ( Figure 4A, B; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Most genes targeted by these TE+ enhancers, as predicted from PCHi-C data, had skewed expression towards ESCs or TSCs ( Figure 4D ). We also selected an element interacting with Smarcad1, a gene involved in pluripotency maintenance ( Hong et al

. Similar results have been found in human embryonic stem cells ( Perde et al.,2017 ) and trooblast stem cells ( Chu et al. 2018 ), where TE+enh play a role in lineage-specific gene expression. Our results suggest that a subset of T are important for gene regulation in mouse embryonic and trooblast stem cells, and highlight the need for functional evaluation of T roles in gene regulation.

    Title: Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C4 photosynthesis
    Abstract: C4 photosynthesis has independently evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages, but, as with other complex traits, how it evolved is unclear. Here we show that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3–C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. We then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model that predicts how the C4 phenotype evolved. The alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. We conclude that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait.

    Supporting Text:
   . Here we report the development of a novel, predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. With this model, we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C4 photosynthesis

., 2011a ). As the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, C4 photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape

. We therefore conclude that these distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures. Furthermore, we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space.

., 2012 ), it is likely that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits. This may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C3 species ( Hibberd et al., 2008 ), expanding the molecular toolbox available to establish C4 traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds.

., 2012 ). Consistent with observations made from several genera, we predict that these cellular alterations are acquired early in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis ( Hylton et al., 1988; McKown and Dengler, 2007; Muhaidat et al., 2011; Sage et al., 2011b ). Importantly, including these additional early traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order of the original 16 traits. Together, these analyses did not alter our main conclusions, suggesting that they are robust

. A recent model for the evolution of the biochemistry associated with the C4 leaf also found that C4 photosynthesis was accessible from any surrounding point of a fitness landscape ( Heckman et al., 2013 ). Our study of C4 anatomy, biochemistry, and cell biology also suggests the C4 phenotype is accessible from multiple trajectories. Encouragingly, the trajectories predicted by Heckman et al

To parameterise the phenotypic landscape underlying photosynthetic phenotypes, data was consolidated from 43 studies encompassing 18 C3, 18 C4, and 37 C3–C4 intermediate species from 22 genera ( Table 1 ). These C3–C4 species are from 18 independent lineages likely representing 18 distinct evolutionary origins of C3–C4 intermediacy ( Sage et al., 2011a ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 )

. The phenotypic landscape underlying the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was then modelled as a transition network, with weighted edges describing the probability of transitions occurring between two phenotypic states ( two nodes on the hypercube, Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). Observed intermediate points were then used to constrain the structure of these phenotypic landscapes

., 2005; Vogan et al., 2007; Christin et al., 2011a; Sage et al., 2011a; Khoshravesh et al., 2012 ) and the prevalence of extant C3–C4 species in genera with the most recent origins of C4 photosynthesis ( Christin et al., 2011b ) all support the notion that C3–C4 species represent phenotypic states through which transitions to C4 photosynthesis could occur

. In addition to the likely order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis, the number of molecular alterations required is also unknown. We therefore aimed to test if multiple traits were predicted to evolve with linked timing, and therefore likely mediated by a single underlying mechanism. To achieve this, we performed a contingency analysis by considering trajectories across phenotype space beginning with a given initial acquisition step

. The numerous differences in leaf development and cell biology between C4 sub-types ( Furbank, 2011 ) may provide clues as to which developmental changes underlie subsequent differences in metabolic evolution. C4 photosynthesis provides an excellent example of how independent lineages with a wide range of ancestral phenotypes can converge upon similar complex traits

. The posterior probability distributions for the acquisition time of each phenotypic trait were combined to produce an objective, computationally generated blueprint for the order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 3 ). These results were consistent with previous work on subsets of C4 lineages that proposed the BS-specificity of GDC occurs prior to the evolution of C4 metabolism ( Hylton et al., 1988; Rawsthorne et al., 1988; Devi et al., 1995; Sage et al

. Furthermore, understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C4 photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species ( Hibberd et al., 2008 ). The C4 pathway is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago ( Christin et al., 2011b ) in response to multiple ecological drivers, including decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ( Vicentini et al., 2008 )

., 1980; Kotayeva et al., 2010 ). To address these unknown aspects of C4 evolutionary history, we combined the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes ( Wright, 1932; Gavrilets, 1997 ) with the analysis of extant C3–C4 intermediate species to develop a predictive model of how the full C4 phenotype evolved.

., 2006; Steiner et al., 2009 ) is underpinned by flexibility in the underlying molecular mechanisms, the extent to which this applies to complex traits is less clear. C4 photosynthesis is both highly complex, involving alterations to leaf anatomy, cellular ultrastructure, and photosynthetic metabolism, and also convergent, being found in at least 60 independent lineages of angiosperms ( Sage et al., 2011a )

. The phylogenetic distribution of known two-celled C4 photosynthetic lineages are annotated, together with the distribution of C3-C4 lineages that we used in this study. The numbers of independent C3-C4, or C4 lineages present in each order are shown in parentheses.

. This bimodality is indicative of multiple distinct pathways to C4 photosynthesis that acquire traits at earlier or later times. To investigate factors underlying this bimodality, we inferred evolutionary pathways generating the C4 leaf using data from monocot and eudicot lineages, or from lineages using NAD malic enzyme ( NAD–ME ) or NADP malic enzyme ( NADP-ME ) as their primary C4 acid decarboxylase

. Analysis of the posterior probabilities of the mean pathways representing either monocots or dicots revealed that this separation is the result of differences in the timing of events generating both anatomical and biochemical traits ( Figure 4C ). We propose that the ancient divergence of the monocot and eudicot clades constrained the evolution of C4 photosynthesis to broadly different evolutionary pathways in each. 10. 7554/eLife. 00961. 016Figure 4

This result, the sister-group relationships of C3–C4 lineages ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ) and the phylogenetic distribution of C–C lineages ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ) were used to constrain the structure of the phenotypic landscape

    Title: Reformulation of an extant ATPase active site to mimic ancestral GTPase activity reveals a nucleotide base requirement for function
    Abstract: Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates releases similar amounts of energy. However, ATP hydrolysis is typically used for energy-intensive reactions, whereas GTP hydrolysis typically functions as a switch. SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVAGTPase functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP-bound intermediate that we report is required for polymerization. Further, incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization. This approach revealed that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

Likewise, SpoIVAGTPase, which was functional in vivo ( Figure 3 ), and could use either ATP or GTP to induce a similar conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis ( Figure 4A, B ), only polymerized in the presence of ATP ( Figures 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1I; Supplementary file 2 ), suggesting a specific requirement for the nucleotide base, not simply the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, for its function

. 5–5 h after the initiation of sporulation, when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat ( Peluso et al., 2019 ), which suggests a selective pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP. Consistent with this notion, we observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase ( Figure 6E, F )

. Both SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase failed to undergo nucleotide hydrolysis-mediated structural changes in the presence of 0. 06 mM GTP at sub-polymerization levels of the protein but did so in the presence of 1. 5 mM ATP ( Figure 6E, F ). However, when we examined SpoIVA polymerization at different concentrations of ATP, we observed that while neither SpoIVA nor SpoIVAGTPase were able to polymerize in the presence of 0

In this study we examined an unusual bacterial cytoskeletal protein, SpoIVA, that hydrolyzes ATP to drive the formation of static polymers. We previously reported that the SpoIVA ATPase is ancestrally derived ( Castaing et al., 2013 ) from an Era-like GTPase, a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases ( Leipe et al., 2002 )

. One puzzling observation was that SpoIVAGTPase, which promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP, functioned similar to the extant SpoIVA in vivo ( Figure 3 ), which led us to wonder why the protein needed to have evolved further

. Although the sporulation efficiency and subcellular localization data indicated that SpoIVAGTPase was largely functional, it was difficult to infer if this variant used ATP or GTP to perform its function in vivo. We therefore monitored the nucleotide hydrolysis-driven conformational change and polymerization of SpoIVA in vitro in the presence of either nucleotide. Structural changes in SpoIVA may be monitored by limited trypsin proteolysis ( Castaing et al., 2013 )

. Since SpoIVAGTPase functioned similar to the extant ( WT ) SpoIVA in vivo with respect to sporulation efficiency and localization ( Figures 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A; Supplementary file 2 ), we wondered if the extant SpoIVA evolved to more efficiently utilize ATP at physiological nucleotide concentrations, in a way that was not evident by measuring sporulation efficiency by heat and lysozyme resistance ( Figures 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A )

. Finally, SpoIVAGTPase localized similar to WT ( Figure 3J–J’ ), consistent with its ability to support sporulation at a near-WT level. Thus, disruption of the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to permit the slightly preferential hydrolysis of GTP over ATP resulted in a protein that largely retained proper function in vivo

. In contrast, while hydrolysis of GTP drove a conformational change in SpoIVA similar to what was achieved with ATP hydrolysis ( Figure 4A, B ), GTP hydrolysis did not permit formation of the high molecular weight intermediate ( and therefore did not permit polymerization ), nor did the protein retain GDP after hydrolysis ( Figure 5B, C ). As sporulation proceeds, intracellular ATP levels 2 hr after the induction of sporulation were reported to reach a high of ~1

. This requirement for ATP led us to propose that the scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A ) could have helped drive the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially utilize ATP. Indeed, amino acid starvation and the onset of stationary phase are known to result in a reduction in GTP and GDP levels, which coincides with an increase in the production of the nucleotide alarmones ( p ) ppGpp ( Kriel et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Ochi et al., 1981 )

. Thus, after GTP levels have dropped at the end of the sporulation program, and when ATP also gradually depletes, the extant SpoIVA has apparently evolved to better utilize ATP to drive efficient polymerization

. 5 hr and 5 hr of sporulation ) therefore suggests a selective pressure that could have driven the initial amino acid substitutions required to switch nucleotide preference from GTP to ATP in SpoIVA and subsequent substitutions to enhance polymerization activity.

. We propose that a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP concentration relative to ATP during the late stages of sporulation could have driven the evolution of SpoIVA to utilize ATP instead of GTP to drive polymerization, a critical step in the morphogenesis of the spore cell surface.

. Interestingly, incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with ATP, but not GTP, partially shifted a population into the void volume ( Figure 5B, bottom right ), indicating that the reengineered SpoIVAGTPase retained its specific dependence on ATP instead of GTP in forming the polymerization-competent intermediate, despite being able to hydrolyze both NTPs

. Taken together, the results are consistent with a model in which SpoIVA, at a low concentration that does not promote polymerization, hydrolyzes ATP to undergo a conformational change and subsequently assembles into heterogeneous high molecular weight multimers that retain the ADP product of hydrolysis. Upon an increase in concentration, this functional SpoIVA multimeric intermediate releases the bound ADP and forms a nucleotide-free mature polymer

. Together, these observations suggested that the changes in the G4 ( NKxD ) and G5 ( SxE ) regions relative to the bona fide GTPases may have contributed to the emergence of ATP-specificity in SpoIVA ( Figure 1E ). To determine the relative contributions of the altered NKxD and SxE motifs in G4 and G5, respectively, on nucleotide hydrolysis specificity of SpoIVA, we first substituted different residues in each motif, either individually or in several combinations

. This ratio revealed a greater than ~30% increase in polymerization rate with ATP than GTP ( Figure 5A, Supplementary file 2 ), surprisingly indicating that the conformational change in SpoIVA driven by GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 4A, B, E ), which appeared similar to the conformational change driven by ATP hydrolysis, did not yield isomers of SpoIVA that were capable of polymerization. We next examined the ability of SpoIVA variants in polymerizing with ATP and GTP

., 1994; Zhong et al., 1995 ). The Glu in the SxE sequence further contributes to ATP hydrolysis specificity and likely stabilizes the binding of ATP over GTP. To ensure that the amino acid substitutions introduced to restore ancestral SpoIVA GTPase activity did not completely abrogate protein function, we tested the ability of the different variants to complement the sporulation defect caused by a deletion of the spoIVA gene in B. subtilis

., 2013 ). To understand the selective pressure underlying the switch in nucleotide specificity of the extant SpoIVA and the mechanistic details governing its function, we sought to restore its ancestral enzymatic ( GTPase ) activity by re-engineering its nucleotide-binding pocket and examining how the altered protein functioned in vivo and in vitro. Achieving this required altering amino acids in two loops near the base of the nucleotide-binding pocket ( G4 and G ) to restore GTPase activity ( Figure 1 ).

    Title: Long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life
    Abstract: Leptin regulates energy balance and also exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor ( LepR ) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems.

    Supporting Text:
   . For example, changes in leptin signaling during development could then affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. Thus, leptin may also be involved in the developmental programming ( Ralevski and Horvath, 2015 ). Accordingly, early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity ( Attig et al., 2008 )

., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004; Donato et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin is not yet fully understood. Thus, to uncover the role of leptin during development, we investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. For this purpose, we studied knockout mice for the Lepr gene that grew without leptin’s effects

. Leptin or LepR deficiency leads to reduced brain mass ( Ahima et al., 1999 ), disruption of the projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVH ) ( Bouret et al., 2004a; Bouret et al., 2004b; Kamitakahara et al., 2018 ), as well as behavioral and cognitive problems ( Liu et al., 2011 ). Therefore, we evaluated the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development

., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004 ). In addition to the role of leptin in energy homeostasis, other studies have shown that leptin can affect developmental processes, especially in the brain ( Ahima et al., 1999 ). Regarding this aspect, rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week of age that is not associated to changes in fat mass or food intake ( Ahima et al., 1998 )

., 2012; Chhabra et al., 2016 ). Thus, our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life, especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide ( Cunningham et al., 2014 ).

. Hence, null mutations in the genes that encode for leptin or LepR impair the capacity of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis, leading to profound metabolic dysfunctions in humans and rodents, including severe obesity, hyperphagia, low-energy expenditure, hypoactivity, insulin resistance and infertility ( Halaas et al., 1995; Montague et al., 1997; Farooqi et al., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004 )

., 2004b ). Importantly, exogenous leptin rescues the development of ARH projections of Lepob/ob mice only when provided in the neonatal period. Thus, these findings suggest that the lack of leptin signaling in the first weeks of life permanently disrupts these projections in mice ( Bouret et al., 2004b ). Important implications arise from the developmental effects of leptin

., 2008 ). Furthermore, neonatal leptin treatment reverses the developmental programming caused by maternal undernutrition ( Vickers et al., 2005 ). However, it is worth mentioning that despite the aforementioned evidence about leptin’s developmental effects, exogenous leptin replacement can reverse key metabolic abnormalities exhibited by leptin-deficient mice or humans ( Pelleymounter et al., 1995; Ioffe et al., 1998; Farooqi et al., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004; Donato et al

Our findings revealed that the absence of leptin signaling in early life led to permanent changes in energy homeostasis, melanocortin system, reproduction and brain development

. However, LepR expression was restored either at the fourth or tenth week of life. Our findings revealed that some defects previously considered irreversible due to the lack of leptin signaling in the neonatal period, such as the poor development of ARH neural projections, can be recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood

To study the importance of leptin signaling during development, we used the LepRNull mouse model that carries a transcription blocker between exons 16 and 17 of the Lepr gene ( Berglund et al., 2012 ), preventing the expression of the long LepR isoform ( Lepr-b ). As expected, adult male and female LepRNull mice were morbidly obese and hyperphagic ( Figure 1A–D )

. Although the complete absence of leptin signaling is rarely found in humans, both undernutrition and overnutrition are able to produce significant changes in serum leptin concentrations, leptin sensitivity or in the development of neurocircuits that regulate energy homeostasis ( Samuelsson et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Vogt et al., 2014; Ralevski and Horvath, 2015 )

. On the other hand, the absence of leptin signaling in early life permanently impairs energy homeostasis, the melanocortin system, as well as the reproduction and brain development.

. In contrast to the results observed after LepR reactivation in adult mice, LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity completely normalized the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in both male and female Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). Leptin not only controls the energy and glucose homeostasis, but it also plays an important role regulating several endocrine systems ( Ahima et al., 1996; Ramos-Lobo and Donato, 2017 )

. Previous studies have shown that there is a critical neonatal period, in which leptin plays a neurotrophic role inducing the development of neural projections from ARH neurons to post-synaptic targets, including the PVH ( Bouret et al., 2004b; Kamitakahara et al., 2018 )

., 1998 ). In addition, 2-week-old mice do not respond to the anorexigenic effects of leptin ( Mistry et al., 1999 ). Thus, leptin does not seem to be involved in the regulation of energy balance during the first weeks of life in mice. However, synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus is regulated by leptin ( Pinto et al., 2004 )

. The metabolic dysfunctions caused by the lack of leptin signaling during development possibly involved changes in neural populations that regulate the energy expenditure, such as POMC or Prlh neurons in the hypothalamus, as well as epigenetic mechanisms since the hypothalamic expression of several enzymes that modulate DNA methylation or histone acetylation were affected in Ubi-LepRNull mice

., 2004 ). Leptin signaling is also required for the formation of the neural projections from the arcuate nucleus ( ARH ) to post-synaptic targets, a process that takes place in the first 2 weeks of life ( Bouret et al., 2004a; Kamitakahara et al., 2018 ). In accordance, leptin promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and leptin-deficient ( Lepob/ob ) mice show disruption of ARH neural projections ( Bouret et al., 2004b )

. Body adiposity was determined by weighting perigonadal ( PG ), subcutaneous ( SC ) and retroperitoneal ( RP ) fat pads in males. For the females, the periovarian ( Ov ) fat pad was also included. To visualize leptin responsive cells in the brain, adult mice ( n = 3–4/group ) received an acute i. p. injection of mouse recombinant leptin ( 5 µg/g, from Dr. A. F

. In accordance with their insulin resistance, serum insulin concentrations remained significantly higher in Ubi-LepRNull mice, compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 4E, J ). Thus, absence of leptin signaling in early life produced long-term alterations in glucose homeostasis, the melanocort system, and brain development.

    Title: Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins regulate immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2 receptor
    Abstract: The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms.

   . In this study, we report XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 modulates flg22-triggered immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex. Prior to activation by flg22, the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1, ensuring optimum signaling competence. After flg22 stimulation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1, indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of Gα from Gβγ

. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state. In addition to the ligand-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1, flg22 induces the phosphorylation of XLG2 in the N terminus

. Together the results show that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling, and the findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants. 10. 7554/eLife. 13568. 012Figure 3. G proteins positively regulate immunity and BIK1 stability. ( A ) AGB1 is required for accumulation of BIK1, but not FLS2 and BAK1

., 2015 ). We show that XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 to regulate FLS2-mediated immunity. Thus, these studies collectively support that plant receptor kinases fulfil the roles of GPCRs by directly coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. Importantly, we show that the G proteins coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS2 signaling

. Indeed, PBL20 was also degraded in WT extracts, and this degradation was enhanced when extracts from xlg2 xlg3 or agb1 mutants were used ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B ). Together these results demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins formed by XLG2/3, AGB1, and AGG1/2 attenuate proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 and PBL20. We next tested whether the regulation of BIK1 stability contributes to the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in flg22-induced immune responses

. Unlike the animal heterotrimeric G proteins, however, the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins additionally regulate signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex prior to receptor activation. Taken together, our results highlight remarkable similarities and striking differences in heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor signaling in animals and plants as a result of independent evolution.

. ( C ) XLG2/3 interact with FLS2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts and the interaction is dynamically regulated by flg22. The indicated constructs were co-expressed in WT protoplasts, and Co-IP assays were performed using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. BIK1K105E carries a mutation in the ATP-binding site. ( D ) The C terminus of XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 kinase domain

. In addition, we provide evidence that activation by flg22 additionally leads to XLG2 phospohrylation by BIK1, and this phosphorylation positively regulates RbohD-dependent ROS production. Together the study illustrates two distinct mechanisms underlying the G protein-mediated regulation of the FLS2 signaling.

As an intensely studied Pattern Recognition Receptor ( PRR ) in plants, FLS2 serves as an excellent model understanding plant innate immune signaling and receptor kinases in general ( Macho and Zipfel, 2014 ). It forms a dynamic complex with the co-receptor BAK1 and the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 to perceive a conserved bacterial flagellar epitope, flg22, to activate a variety of defense responses ( Chinchilla et al., 2007; Heese et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al

. 10. 7554/eLife. 13568. 016Figure 4. BIK1 level accounts for G protein-mediated regulation of FLS2 immunity. ( A ) Transient expression of BIK1 in agb1 and xlg2/3 mutant protoplasts restores RbohD phosphorylation. FLAG-RbohD and BIK1-HA constructs are transiently expressed in protoplasts from WT ( Col-0 ), agb1 and xlg2/3. FLAG-RbohD protein was affinity purified and detected by anti-FLAG and anti-pSer39 immuoblots. ( B ) BIK1 transgene restores flg22-induced ROS burst in agb1

. As shown in Figure 1C, the flg22 treatment resulted in a great reduction in XLG2-AGB1 interaction in Nb plants, suggesting that Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins are reminiscent of their animal counterparts in that the heterotrimer is dynamically regulated upon ligand activation of receptors

., 2007; Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013 ). Stability of FLS2 and BIK1 is subject to regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome system and a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( Lu et al., 2011; Monaghan et al., 2014 ). We and others previously showed that BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to prime flg22-induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS; Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014 )

. The flg22-induced dissociation of the G proteins from BIK1 coincides with the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation triggers the dissociation of the G proteins. Indeed, de-phosphorylation of BIK1 strongly enhanced its interactions with both XLG2 and AGB1 in vitro. The decoupling of the G proteins from the receptor maybe necessary for the regulation of down-stream effectors

. The interaction between XLG2/3 and AGB1, which leads to the formation of XLG2/3-AGB1-AGG1/2 heterotrimers ( Maruta et al., 2015; Chakravorty et al., 2015 ), is dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1 likely reflects an increase of GTP-bound form of Gα which dissociates from the Gβγ dimer upon receptor activation. Secondly, the interactions of the G proteins with FLS2 and BIK1 are also dynamically regulated by flg22

. Col-0 NP::BIK1-HA plants displayed higher level of ROS compared to non-transgenic WT plants ( Figure 4B ), indicating that BIK1 protein level is rate-limiting in flg22-induced immune responses. We further tested the impact of the NP::BIK1-HA transgene on flg22-induced resistance to Pst. While the agb1 consistently supported greater amount of bacterial growth compared to WT plants following flg22 treatment, the agb1 NP::BIK1-HA plants were indistinguishable from WT ( Figure 4C )

. Col-0 NP::BIK1-HA plants supported less bacterial growth than did WT plants, further supporting the importance of BIK1 abundance in FLS2-mediated immunity. We similarly introduced the NP::BIK1-HA transgene into xlg2 xlg3 double mutant plants by transformation. The resulting transgenic lines displayed near WT ROS production ( Figure 4D ) and Pst resistance ( Figure 4E ) in response to flg22 treatment, indicating that XLG2/3 also regulate FLS2-mediated immunity by modulating B1 stability

In summary, we show that Arabidopsis heterotrimer G proteins composed of XL2, A1, and G1/2 dynamically interact with the F2-B1 receptor complex and regulate F2-mediated immunity through both pre- and post-activation mechanisms. The proteins attenuate proteas-dependent degradation of B1 prior to fl22 activation, and following fl22, XL2 dissociates from A1 and is phosphorylated by1 in the terminus. The phosphorylated XL2 enhances ROS production by modulating the NAD oxidase RhoD. The study demonstrates that the proteins are directly coupled to the F2 receptor and regulate signaling through both pre- and post-activation mechanisms.

    Title: Coordination of robust single cell rhythms in the Arabidopsis circadian clock via spatial waves of gene expression
    Abstract: The Arabidopsis circadian clock orchestrates gene regulation across the day/night cycle. Although a multiple feedback loop circuit has been shown to generate the 24-hr rhythm, it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells, or how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. Here we examine clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations, albeit desynchronised. In particular, we observe two waves of clock activity; one going down, and one up the root. We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and our measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points.

    Supporting Text:
   . From our single cell data, we are able to estimate the coupling strength between cells, and find evidence of coupling, especially strong in the root tip. A simple model suggests that our observed period differences, plus cell-to-cell coupling, can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression. Thus, our data reveals both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system.

., 2015 ). However, our results suggest that the structure of the plant clock is more complicated, as this hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip, or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip. Our results support a more decentralised model of clock coordination in plants ( Endo, 2016; Endo et al., 2014 ). Earlier studies of the Arabidopsis clock argue either that cellular oscillations are uncoupled ( Thain et al

., 2012 ). Previous studies have attempted to measure the clock in Arabidopsis at single-cell resolution; however, these have focused on specific parts of the plant for short time series ( Takahashi et al., 2015; Yakir et al., 2011 ). Here, using a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 ( CCA1 ) ( Wang and Tobin, 1998 ), we examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single cell level over several days

., 1999 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1b ), suggesting that our results are a general property of the clock. The coherent waves of gene expression suggested that the plant clock signal could be coupled. To estimate this coupling, we calculated the order parameter ( Kuramoto, 1984 ) from our single cell data and estimated the coupling strength based on a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont and Naef, 2007 )

. Our results reveal that damping of rhythms at the whole plant level is mainly due to desynchronisation of oscillating single cells with different periods, and not due to noise in gene expression due to low molecule numbers or damping of individual oscillations. We observe two waves of clock gene expression, one up and one down the root. These waves, combined with more variable clock periods at each position in the root, cause the most desynchronisation

. A hierarchical structure for the plant clock has recently been proposed, similar to that for the mammalian clock, where the shoot apex clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al., 2015 ). However, there are further tissue-dependent differences that must be explained. For example, experiments using a luciferase reporter for clock activity have shown waves of clock gene expression in leaves ( Fukuda et al., 2007; Wenden et al

. In the future it will be interesting to develop more mechanistic models of the plant circadian clock at the single cell level, as has been done at the bulk level previously ( Fogelmark and Troein, 2014; Guerriero et al., 2012; Locke et al., 2005; Locke et al., 2006; Pokhilko et al., 2012 ). One barrier to achieving this is that currently our estimations of clock periods from single cells are from the intact plant, and so will include the effects of cell-cell coupling

., 2007; Wenden et al., 2012 ), as well as striped expression patterns in roots ( Fukuda et al., 2012 ). Beyond the coordination of plant rhythms, how robust the circadian clock is in individual cells across the plant is also unclear. Through integration of data from whole plant studies, a genetic circuit consisting of multiple coupled feedback loops has been proposed to generate the 24-hr rhythm ( Fogelmark and Troein, 2014; Pokhilko et al., 2012 )

Our single cell measurements have revealed tissue specific differences in the phases and robustness of the clock in Arabidopsis. These differences are not restricted to one cell type, as similar periods are observed in the z dimension through the plant ( Figure 3c, d ), suggesting that cells are instead responding to information based on their longitudinal position

The circadian clock controls gene expression throughout the day and night in most organisms, from single cell photosynthetic bacteria to mammals ( Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005; Dunlap and Loros, 2017 ). In many cases, a core circuit that generates this rhythm has been elucidated and been shown to oscillate in single cells. In multi-cellular organisms, these single cell rhythms can be integrated to allow a coordinated response to the environment ( Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005 )

. To develop mechanistic models at the single cell-level, it will be critical to develop reliable methods to measure the rhythmic properties of physiologically representative plant cells in physical isolation. It will also be important to test future models by examining the clock experimentally under a range of environmental conditions and at different developmental stages

. In the top part of the root we observed strong damping of the circadian rhythm ( black line, Figure 1g ), although the oscillations recovered somewhat in the root tip ( grey line, Figure 1g ). Three repeat plants showed similar behaviour ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). We also observed similar behaviour in our CCA1-long reporter line ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ), showing that our results remain true across a range of clock activity

. The observed robust rhythms in the hypocotyl that peak before the cotyledon and the top of the root, with a wave of clock gene expression down the root, fit with a proposed hierarchical structure for the plant clock, where the shoot apex clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al., 2015 )

., 2005 ). Mammals achieve this by driving oscillations in peripheral tissues from a central pacemaker in the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) ( Pando et al., 2002; Reppert and Weaver, 2002 ). The Arabidopsis circadian clock generates a 24 hr rhythm in multiple key processes, including stomata opening, photosynthesis, and hypocotyl elongation ( Hsu and Harmer, 2014 )

. These heterogeneous oscillations could be synchronised by light-dark cycles ( Okada et al., 2017 ). Our single cell approach is consistent with weak coupling across the whole plant but reveals regions with strong local coupling between cells, especially in the root tip, which is sufficient to drive an increase in synchrony with time

., 2005 ). To investigate the mechanism for the waves of clock gene expression in the root we developed a simple mathematical model where the cells are described by coupled oscillators with different periods, as informed by the data ( Figure 3k ). The periods of the clock in the model were faster in the shoot and root tip than the rest of the root, as measured experimentally

. To further understand the spatial structure of the clock, we examined montages of clock gene expression ( Figure 3e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1g; Videos 1–3 ) and timing of peaks of expression ( Figure 3f–h ) across the plant. Examination of the clock phase between 48 and 72 hr reveals that the clock peaks earlier in the hypocotyl ( mean phase in upper hypocotyl 51. 2 ± 1. 1h, mean phase in lower hypocotyl 52. 1 ± 1. 5h ) than in the cotyledon ( mean phase 55. 6 ± 2

. Thus, the damped mean rhythm of clock activity we observed in the root ( Figure 1g ) is caused by the averaging of these two waves of gene expression that have a broad distribution of phases. We observed qualitatively similar waves in luciferase reporter lines for the clock genes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 ( Ito et al., 2003 ) ( Figure 3i; Video 4 ), CCA1 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1a ) and GIGANTEA ( Park et al

. An important next step will be to investigate what the coupling signal is for the plant circadian clock and how it is transmitted between cells, as well as the role of cell-to-cell coupling in the robustness of the clock. Our results suggest that the Arabid clock is not a centralised like the mammalian clock, but instead has multiple points of coordination. This is consistent with a decentralised model of the plant clock ( Endo 2016; Endo et al. 2014 ).
Researchers investigated the neural and behavioral markers of multi-talker speech perception in adults with clinically normal hearing. They found that multi-talker intelligibility varied widely in normal adults and could be predicted from neural-lock to modulation (FM) cues measured by ear EEG recordings. Combining neural fine processing, pupil-indexed listening, and FM accounted for 78% of variability in multialker intelligibility. Disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multialker perception identified could inform next-generation clinical tests for hearing disorders.

A battery of behavioral and physiological tests accounted for nearly 80% of variability in multialker intelligibility without linguistic cues. Individuals with clinically normal hearing exhibited considerable variability in measures, but neither had meaningful relationship with multialker recognition thresholds. Pupil functions correlated with difficulty in multialker task, leading to significant correlation between pupil change and intelligibility (r=0.53, p=0.03). Researchers aimed to develop objective markers explaining complaints of poor communication in clinically hearing individuals.

Association between psychophysical FM detection and speech-noise intelligibility attributed to early encoding cues at stages of processing. Correlation between low FM and intelligibility might reflect correlation between measure fast processing and intelligibility. FM strongly correlated with behavioral detection, suggesting FM reflects aspects of task, and correlated with performance on digits, suggesting fine timing cues contribute multialker intelligibility. To understand supr hearing problems, 23 young listeners participated in multi-stage study with questionnaires, behavioral measures, and EEG.

Correlation between psych tone FM and multialker recognition striking (r=0.85) documented by independent groups using various paradigms. Examined poor-no intelligibility associated with auditory integrity, encoding, fast processing, and cognitive resources. Developed non-invasive measure neural phase-lock early processing. Found intellig thresholds correlated self-reported multi conditions, suggesting comprehension captures real difficulties (r=0.46, p=0.02). Adaptations clinical tests identified deficits multialker intelligibility. Among measures, best model included bottom-up fine processing and top-down effort. Correlation talker and thresholds may reflect representation, instead general aptitude utilizing resources perform tasks.

    Title: Imaging single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the living retina
    Abstract: Tissue light scatter limits the visualization of the microvascular network deep inside the living mammal. The transparency of the mammalian eye provides a noninvasive view of the microvessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system. Despite its clarity, imperfections in the optics of the eye blur microscopic retinal capillaries, and single blood cells flowing within. This limits early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. To break this barrier, we use 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow, in one of the most widely used research animals: the C57BL/6J mouse. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude ( 0. 0002–1. 55 µL min–1 ) across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters ( 3. 2–45. 8 µm ), without requiring surgery or contrast dye. Here, we describe the ultrafast imaging, analysis pipeline and automated measurement of millions of blood cell speeds.

   . While the above studies employing adaptive optics have enabled noninvasive measurement of single-cell velocity, measurement of blood flow in the full range of vessel sizes of the mammalian retinal circulation is yet to be achieved. This has partly been a problem of scale as automation is needed to perform quantitative measurements in larger vessels containing hundreds of thousands of blood cells flowing per second

. In this study, we report single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels in the living mouse retina. This was enabled by AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to noninvasively image blood cells without foreign contrast agents. Pairing this novel imaging paradigm with an automated analysis workflow enabled high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second

. Development on quantification of mouse blood flow approaches will be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. In this study, we innovate imaging strategies as well as deploy custom algorithms to image single blood cells noninvasively in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation ( lumen diameters: 3. 2–45. 8 µm ) ; without requiring exogenous contrast agents to facilitate measurement

. We have shown recently ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ) that with label-free adaptive optics imaging, improved contrast of single blood cells can be achieved in the retina, compared to contrast of dye labeling techniques, especially in high flow conditions. Our method of noninvasively studying the retina may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the CNS. The eye may also serve as a window to systemic microvascular health

. Combined, these imaging capabilities enabled single blood cell resolution as they flowed in both tight and sparsely packed formations inside microvessels ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ). All flowing cells were imaged noninvasively with near infrared backscatter, without the need for foreign dye injections. Furthermore, this detailed resolution enabled sub-micrometer precision when measuring the lumen diameters of retinal vessels. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied

. In capillaries, average cell velocity and average flow rate was measured using orthogonal scanning ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and described later ), supplementing the lumen diameter and cell flux reported in single-file-flow capillaries in our previous publication ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ). For the mouse, we define ‘large’ vessels as first generation vessels near the optic disk, that is vessels that have not yet branched in the retinal plane ( diameters: 45. 8 to 20

. The mouse is the most widely used laboratory animal, yet there is a paucity of studies providing measures of retinal blood flow in the same. This gap need be addressed as the mouse has been and continues to be used to model human retinal physiology, including blood flow. The challenge of imaging mouse retinal blood flow is attributed to the difficulties of imaging its rather small eye, with even the largest vessels being only a quarter the size of the largest human retinal vessel

. Detecting subtle functional changes to flow becomes exceedingly difficult as the ratio of vessel lumen to RBC diameter decreases, because of the particulate nature of blood flow. Due to the above challenges, a device that can noninvasively study single-cell blood flow dynamics in the full range of retinal vessel sizes in the living body has not yet been demonstrated, in either the mouse or human

. To our knowledge, blood-cell velocity profiles have never been measured in the mouse retina, in any vessel size, because of limitations of imaging resolution. For the same reason, it has always been difficult to quantitatively measure such a profile in small retinal microvessels, in any species. Investigators have used adaptive optics to report velocity profile as a function of cardiac phase in vessels as small as a 72 µm artery in the human retina ( Zhong et al., 2011 )

. To our knowledge, we provide the first measurement of cross-sectional blood-cell velocity profile and the first absolute measurement of pulsatile blood-cell velocity in the mouse retina. We also provide the first measures of mean ( and pulsatile ) velocity and flow rate in medium and small vessels ( capillaries ) of the mouse retina

Seminal work studying blood flow in the human retina using adaptive optics space-time images ( Tam et al., 2011b; Zhong et al., 2008 ) used manual determination of cell velocity, which could take hours to days of analysis time due to the problem of scale ( hundreds of thousands of blood cell measurements required per vessel for even a few seconds of collected data ). Lengthy analysis times preclude the use of such techniques in a clinical setting

. On the other hand, disrupted perfusion at the level of small capillaries can have a slow but severe influence ( hours to years ) on the rest of the retinal tissue, as is believed to be the case in diabetic retinopathy. Our approach addresses some of these challenges by using the same imaging instrument to get measures of absolute single–cell blood flow in the smallest to largest retinal vessels in the living retina

. Our direct cell-by-cell measurement of particulate blood flow opens new possibilities to study flow dynamics in the full range of retinal vessels sizes, enabling detailed study of laminar flow in the larger vessels and the complex nature of non-Newtonian and single blood cell rheology at the level of small capillaries. At the capillary level, this direct measurement is critical as simple diameter-resistance models poorly represent the particulate nature of single-cell blood flow

., 2006; Shih et al., 2012 ). It is also worth mentioning important studies in the rat retina which have achieved measurement of blood flow in a large spectrum of vessel sizes/orders, using fluorescently labeled red blood cells ( Kornfield and Newman, 2014; Kornfield and Newman, 2015 )

., 2013 ). A graphical summary, classified by imaging technique, is given in Figure 11. In our literature survey, some important points were observed. There is disagreement across previous studies in the values of measured dimeter, velocity and flow of first-generation vessels in the mouse retina

. Multiple investigators have measured pulsatile flow in the human retinal microcirculation using adaptive optics, including pulsatile leukocyte velocity in human capillaries ( Martin and Roorda, 2009; Tam et al., 2011a; Tam et al., 2011b ), pulsatile erythrocyte velocity in human capillaries ( de Castro et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2018 ), and pulsatile erythrocyte velocity in medium-sized human arterioles/venules ( Zhong et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2011 )

. While investigating the mouse literature for normative values of diameter, velocity and flow in retinal vessels, we found, first, that there is a paucity of such studies. To the best of our knowledge, we have counted all of 15 journal papers which measure retinal blood velocity and/or flow in the living mouse eye ( Blair et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2013; Lee and Harris, 2008; Liu et al., 2017; Muir et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Watts et al

. A large range of mean velocities ( 0. 5–23. 1 mm s–1 ) and mean flow rates were measured ( 0. 0002–1. 55 µL min–1 ) across the smallest to largest retinal vessels in the mouse retina, thus giving a functional map of the complete vascular network of an intact organ in its native environment. Importantly, mean velocity was observed to be heterogenous across vessel diameters ( Figure 10A for arbitrary linear fits, arterioles: R2 = 0. 31, venules: R2 = 0. 43, capillaries: R2 = 0

. Finally, the noninvasive nature of this study, and the safe use of no contrast agents, make it suitable for use in clinical settings, such as retinal disease diagnosis and monitoring. This is especially important as the eye is a window to the brain and systemic circulation, and changes in retinal blood flow can be indicative of disease elsewhere in the body, such as diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

    Title: Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots triggered by receptor-like kinases
    Abstract: Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK ) is indispensable for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza ( AM ) as well as nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, but the mechanisms that discriminate between the two distinct symbiotic developmental fates have been enigmatic. In this study, we show that upon ectopic expression, the receptor-like kinase genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ), NFR5, and SYMRK initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signalling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Only SYMRK but not NFR overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.

   . japonicus roots, we employed the overexpression constructs of NFR1, NFR5, or the unrelated EF-Tu receptor kinase ( EFR; Zipfel et al., 2006 ) for co-immuno-enrichment experiments. The EFR construct did not interfere with nodulation in wild-type plants ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Endogenous full-length SYMRK was co-enriched with NFR1 and NFR5, but not with EFR demonstrating association of SYMRK and both NFRs ( Figure 4 )

. The SYMRK-mediated loss of signalling specificity may be explained by simultaneous complex formation of SYMRK with NFR1 and NFR5, and related LysM-RLKs that mediate recognition of signals from the AM fungus ( Maillet et al., 2011; Op Den Camp et al., 2011 ), which results in the release of both negative regulatory mechanisms, or by an unbalanced stoichiometry of SYMRK and putative specific negative regulators of AM- and root nodule symbiosis signalling

., 2011; Genre et al., 2013 ) and a NFR5-related LysM-RLK from Parasponia has been pinpointed as a likely candidate for their perception ( Op Den Camp et al., 2011 ). The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for AM and root nodule symbiosis. A subset of these genes is essential for either the generation or the decoding of calcium-spiking. In L. japonicus, the former group encodes the RLK Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK; Stracke et al., 2002; Antolín-Llovera et al

. japonicus roots ( Figure 4 ). Interestingly, under these conditions, the SYMRK-NFR association was detected in the absence of nodulation factor ( Figure 4 ). In mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases as well as plant RLKs, ligand-induced receptor dimerization is the single most critical step in signal initiation ( Li et al., 2002; Nam and Li, 2002; Schlessinger, 2002; Chinchilla et al., 2007; Schulze et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2013a, 2013b )

A hallmark of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis of legumes is the accommodation of rhizobia inside plant root cells in specialised organs—the nodules—that provide a favourable environment for nitrogen fixation. Given that the common symbiosis pathway is operating in AM symbiosis in most land plants, the discovery that expression of either of the three symbiotic RLK constructs from the strong Ubiquitin promoter leads to the spontaneous formation of nodules in transgenic L

., 2011 ), this finding also provides a conceptual mechanism for the integration of signals from the rhizobial and fungal microsymbiont through alternative complex formation between SYMRK and NFRs or AM factor receptors. One question that has puzzled the community since the postulate of a common symbiosis pathway is how the decision between the developmental pathways of AM or root nodule symbiosis is made when the signalling employs identical signalling components

., 2014 ). This is in line with the observation that dominant active variants of CCaMK were able to restore nodulation and infection in symrk mutant backgrounds, indicating that a main function of SYMRK in symbiosis is the activation of CCaMK ( Hayashi et al., 2010; Madsen et al., 2010 ). We observed association between SYMRK and either NFR1 or NFR5 upon NFR overexpression in L. japonicus roots ( Figure 4 )

. A negative regulatory role would explain the exaggerated root hair response of symrk mutants to rhizobia ( Stracke et al., 2002 ), since NFR1–NFR5 interaction is no longer under governance by SYMRK-ΔMLD. It has been demonstrated recently that expression of the intracellular kinase domain of SYMRK ( SYMRK-KD ) from Medicago truncatula or Arachis hypogaea in M. truncatula roots from the CaMV 35S promoter induces nodule organogenesis in the absence of rhizobia ( Saha et al., 2014 )

. However, the three RLK genes were not equally effective in inducing the symbiotic program: NFR5 or NFR1 overexpression resulted in a lower percentage of root systems showing promoter activation and formation of spontaneous nodules when compared to SYMRK overexpression ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Figure 2B )

. japonicus ( Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014 ). As our SYMRK antibody does not recognise endogenous SYMRK-ΔMLD, we were not able to assess whether overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 also associates with this truncated SYMRK variant in L. japonicus roots. In a hypothetical scenario, the SYMRK-ΔMLD complex with NFR5 forms constitutively to prevent inappropriate signalling, for example in the absence of rhizobia

. We observed that NFR5 requires NFR1 as well as SYMRK for the spontaneous initiation of symbiosis signalling. This provides support for a model first put forward by Radutoiu et al. ( 2003 ), in which NFR1 and NFR5 engage in a nodulation factor perception complex. This model has received additional support through their synergistic effect on promoting cell death in N. benthamiana ( Madsen et al., 2011; Pietraszewska-Bogiel et al., 2013 )

    Title: DeepPoseKit, a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning
    Abstract: Quantitative behavioral measurements are important for answering questions across scientific disciplines—from neuroscience to ecology. State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here, we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed >2x with no loss in accuracy compared to currently available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings—including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.

    Here, we have presented a new software toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for estimating animal posture using deep learning models. We built on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks to achieve fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. Our new pose estimation model, called Stacked DenseNet, offers considerable improvements ( Figure 3a; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) over the models from Mathis et al

Together these advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, more reliable behavioral datasets that could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment. In conclusion, we have presented a new toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for automatically measuring animal posture from images

. Achieving fast pose estimation using CNNs typically relies on massively parallel processing on the GPU with large batches of data or requires downsampling the images to increase speed, which increases error ( Mathis and Warren, 2018 ). These factors make fast and accurate real-time inference challenging to accomplish. Our Stacked DenseNet model, with a batch size of one, can run inference at ∼30–110 Hz—depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps ( Appendix 1—figure 1b )

. In contrast to conventional computer-vision methods, modern deep-learning–﻿based methods can be used to achieve near human-level accuracy in almost any scenario by manually annotating data ( Figure 1 ) —known as a training set—and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm—a convolutional neural network or CNN—to automatically estimate the locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images ( Figure 2 )

., 2018 ), we implemented two fast pose estimation models that extend the state-of-the-art model for individual pose estimation introduced by Newell et al. ( 2016 ) and the current state-of-the art for convolutional regression from Jégou et al. ( 2017 ). Our model implementations use fewer parameters than both the DeepLabCut model ( Mathis et al., 2018 ) and LEAP model ( Pereira et al., 2019 ) while simultaneously removing many of the limitations of these architectures

. These models are used to measure animal posture by training the network to transform images into probabilistic estimates of keypoint locations, known as confidence maps ( shown in Figure 2 ), that describe the body posture for one or more individuals. These confidence maps are processed to produce the 2-D spatial coordinates of each keypoint, which can then be used for further analysis. While deep-learning models typically need large amounts of training data, both Mathis et al

., 2018 ). We highlighted important considerations when using CNNs for pose estimation and reviewed the progress of fully convolutional regression models from the literature. The latest advancements for these models have been driven mostly by a strategy of adding more connections between layers to increase performance and efficiency ( e. g., Jégou et al., 2017 ). Future progress for this class of models may require better loss functions ( Goodfellow et al., 2014; Johnson et al

., 2019; Günel et al., 2019 ), which increases the cost and complexity of creating an experimental setup, as well as the manual labor required for annotating a training set, which must include labeled data from every camera view. These limitations make it clear that fundamentally-different methods may be required to move the field forward. New pose estimation methods are already replacing human annotations with fully articulated volumetric 3-D models of the animal’s body ( e. g

., 2015 ), which they call LEAP ( LEAP Estimates Animal Pose ), that attempts to limit model complexity and overparameterization with the goal of maximizing inference speed ( see Appendix 6 ) —however, our comparisons from this paper suggest ( Pereira et al., 2019 ) achieved only limited success compared to the DeepLabCut model ( Mathis et al., 2018 )

. ( 2018 ) ( DeepLabCut ) and Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) ( LEAP ), and our software framework also provides a simplified interface ( Figure 3b ) for using these advanced tools to measure animal behavior and locomotion. We tested our methods across a range of datasets from controlled laboratory environments with single individuals to challenging field situations with multiple interacting individuals and variable lighting conditions

. Once the barriers for implementing and training a model are sufficiently reduced, the main bottleneck for using these methods becomes collecting an adequate training set—a labor-intensive task made less time-consuming by techniques described in Appendix 3. Mathis et al. ( 2018 ) and Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) were the first to popularize the use of CNNs for animal pose estimation. These researchers built on work from the human pose estimation literature ( e. g., Andriluka et al

. The locust and zebra datasets are particularly challenging for pose estimation as they feature multiple interacting individuals—with focal individuals centered in the frame—and the latter with highly-variable environments and lighting conditions. These datasets are freely-available from https://github. com/jgraving/deepposekit-data ( Graving et al., 2019; copy archived at https://github. com/elifesciences-publications/DeepPoseKit-Data )

These inverse graphics models ( Kulkarni et al., 2015; Sabour et al., 2017; Valentin et al

. Additionally, we demonstrated that these modifications improve not the just the average error but also help to reduce extreme prediction errors—a key determinant for the reliability of subsequent statistical analysis. While our results offer a good-faith comparison of the available methods for animal pose estimation, there is inherent uncertainty that we have attempted to account for but may still bias our conclusions

. Each level of the hierarchical graph is built from lower levels in the output, which forces the model to learn correlated features across multiple scales when making predictions. We find that training our Stacked DenseNet model to predict a hierarchical posture graph reduces keypoint prediction error ( Appendix 1—figure 2 ), and because the feature maps for the posture graph can be removed from the final output during inference, this effectively improves prediction accuracy for free

., 2017 ). Understanding the connections between brain activity and behavioral output requires detailed and objective descriptions of body posture that match the richness and resolution neural measurement technologies have provided for years ( Anderson and Perona, 2014; Berman, 2018; Brown and de Bivort, 2018 ), which our methods and other deep-learning–﻿based tools provide ( Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019 )

. In the case of F-CNN models used for pose estimation, improvements in efficiency and robustness have been made through the use of multi-scale inference ( Appendix 4: 'Encoder-decoder models' ) by increasing connectivity between the model’s many layers across multiple spatial scales ( Appendix 4—figure 1 ) Multi-scale inference implicitly allows the model to simultaneously integrate large-scale global information, such as the lighting, image background, or the orientation of the focal

( 2016 ) ( Appendix 5 ) with hyperparameters that allow for changing the number of filters in each convolutional block to constrain the number of parameters—rather than using 256 filters for all layers as described in Newell et al. ( 2016 ). In addition to implementing our efficient pose estimation models, we developed a new method to process model outputs to allow for faster, more accurate predictions

. Mathis et al., 2018 developed their pose estimation model, which they call DeepLabCut, by extending the state-of-the model for individual pose estimation by Newell et al (2016) and the state-of-the for convolutional regression Jég et al (2017).

    Title: Disruption of glycolytic flux is a signal for inflammasome signaling and pyroptotic cell death
    Abstract: When innate immune cells such as macrophages are challenged with environmental stresses or infection by pathogens, they trigger the rapid assembly of multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes that are responsible for initiating pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death termed pyroptosis. We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.

Therefore, disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation.

. They suggest that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, in turn activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and S. typhimurium effectively limited glycolysis through distinct mechanisms, each resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis

. Importantly, we found that the NAD+ consumption rate increased upon pyruvate treatment ( Figure 9I ), indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream of glycolysis in infected BMDMs. Taken together, these data indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death.

. When functionally blocked, innate immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, resulting in inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Our results using this molecule and other established inhibitors of these enzymes suggest that disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages.

Pyruvate supplementation had no effect on inflammasome signaling induced by the NLRP3 activators ATP and nigericin ( Figure 6C–E ), indicating that pyruvate does not impair NLRP3 inflammasome signaling by a nonspecific mechanism

. typhimurium similarly results in inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death in an effort to clear the pathogen. Restoration of metabolism downstream of glycolytic disruption by GB111-NH2 or S. typhimurium infection was sufficient to abrogate the inflammasome response by restoring NADH production and preventing mitochondrial ROS production

. The inactive precursor of the cytokine interleukin-1β ( pro-IL-1β ) is also recruited to the inflammasome complex, where proteolysis by caspase-1 induces activation and secretion of the bioactive cytokine, further promoting inflammation. In addition to cytokine maturation, inflammasome formation and caspase activation are associated with a pro-inflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis ( Fink and Cookson, 2006 )

. These metabolic defects appeared on a similar timescale as initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome formation, suggesting that infection with S. typhimurium has a direct effect on glycolytic flux in host cells. Consistent with our findings using glycolytic inhibitors, we also observed that supplementation of cells with the glycolytic end product pyruvate significantly reduced inflammasome formation, IL-1β secretion, and cell death induced by S. typhimurium infection ( Figure 9A–D )

. Here, we report a small molecule, GB111-NH2, that induces NLRP3 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptotic cell death in bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ). Using chemical proteomics, we identify the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and α-enolase as the phenotypically relevant targets of this molecule. Facilitating TCA metabolism downstream of glycolysis by addition of pyruvate or succinate blocked the effects of the compound. We find that S

. Glycolytic disruption may be a broadly relevant mechanism of NLRP3 activation triggered in response to metabolic parasitism by microbes. Moreover, this pathway may also provide novel avenues for treating diseases in which NLRP3-driven inflammation results in pathology.

. Addition of extracellular K+, in contrast, did not reduce the number of inflammasome foci in GB111-NH2-treated BMDMs ( Figure 7I ) or impair GB111-NH2-induced cell death ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ), indicating that mitochondrial ROS, but not K+ efflux, is required for GB111-NH2-induced NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis. We and others have shown that the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium ( S

., 2011; Strowig et al., 2012 ), though the specific mechanisms driving macrophage and NLRP3 activation in these diseases have remained unclear. We speculate that, since glucose metabolism is often impaired in these diseases, glycolytic impairment may be the mechanism driving NLRP3-dependent inflammation

. S. typhimurium and chemical inhibitors disrupt glycolytic flux in LPS-primed BMDM, resulting in an increase in NAD+/NADH, a decrease in ATP production, and a decrease in lactate secretion. TCA cycle metabolism is also impaired, potentiating the elevated NAD+/NADH ratio into the mitochondria. Mitochondrial ROS are produced by glycolytic disruption and trigger NLRP3 inflammasome formation, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13663

., 2013 ). Disruption of glycolytic flux led to an NAD+/NADH imbalance and induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation, which has been shown here and elsewhere ( Tschopp and Schroder, 2010; Zhou et al., 2010 ) to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome ( Figure 10 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 13663. 024Figure 10.

( A ) LPS-primed BMDM were treated with the indicated compounds ( GB111-NH2 - 10 μM, sodium pyruvate - 1 mM, AA5 - 10 μM, oligomycin A - 1 μM, rotenone - 5 μM ) for 2 hr, after which cells were fixed, stained for ASC and DAPI, and visualized by microscopy

. Restoring glycolysis or downstream TCA cycle metabolism through supplementation with specific metabolites or activation of glycolytic enzymes could be therapeutically useful for dampening inflammation and associated immunopathology. In summary, our results suggest that inhibition of glycolysis creates a unique metabolic state that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome

. Macrophages containing active inflammasome complexes often rapidly die by a pro-inflammatory process called pyroptosis ( Fink and Cookson, 2006 ). We observed features of this form of cell death in GB111-NH2-treated BMDM, including release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ( Figure 1J ), and foci of caspase-1 activity in propidium iodide ( PI ) and Annexin V ( AnnV ) positive cells ( Figure 1K )

While screening peptide-based compounds for their effects on inflammasome signaling, we identified one compound, GB111-NH2 ( Blum et al., 2005; Verdoes et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 1A ), that was sufficient to induce caspase-1 activation, IL-β secretion and pyptosis in LPS-primed BMD ( Figure 1B–D ). GB-N2H also induced inflamome formation in BMD ( Figure 1E ), which was blocked by addition of the glycol product pyruate ( Figure 1F ) or the glycol inhibitor oligomycin ( Figure 1G ) but not the TCA inhibitor roten ( Figure 1H ).

    Title: Novel RNA and DNA strand exchange activity of the PALB2 DNA binding domain and its critical role for DNA repair in cells
    Abstract: BReast Cancer Associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1, −2 ) and Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) protein are tumour suppressors linked to a spectrum of malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PALB2 coordinates functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 during homology-directed repair ( HDR ) and interacts with several chromatin proteins. In addition to protein scaffold function, PALB2 binds DNA. The functional role of this interaction is poorly understood. We identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and the overall HDR efficiency in cells by 50%. PALB2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain ( N-DBD ) stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase. Surprisingly, it possesses the strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, N-DBD stimulates the inverse strand exchange and can use DNA and RNA substrates. Our data reveal a versatile DNA interaction property of PALB2 and demonstrate a critical role of PALB2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells.

    We identified major DNA-binding residues of PALB2 and demonstrated their critical role for HDR in cells. PALB2 is described as a scaffold protein linking BRCA1 with BRCA2 during HDR and interacting with many other chromatin proteins. However, the truncation variant with the preserved BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs but without the middle portion of the protein, which contains DBDs, does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 recruitment to DSBs ( Sy et al., 2009b )

. Mutations of only four amino acids significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and the efficiency of HDR in a model cell system. PALB2 N-DBD by itself stimulates RAD51 strand exchange reactions. Surprisingly, we found that the PALB2 N-DBD supports both forward and inverse strand exchange even in the absence of RAD51 and can use RNA as a substrate. Altogether, our data reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance.

. Even at 8 hr post-IR siRNA PALB2 cells complemented with PALB2-146AAAA still display a defect in HR. We suggest that the mutant display a failure to repair a subset of DSBs due to its defective DNA binding. Therefore, PALB2 interaction with DNA is critical for recruitment of the BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. Secondly, we demonstrate that the PALB2 N-DBD stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro

Breast cancer associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1, −2 ) regulate an efficient non-mutagenic pathway of chromosome break repair and are described as guardians of chromosomal integrity ( Venkitaraman, 2014 ). They initiate RAD51-mediated homologous recombination ( HR ) ( Davies et al., 2001; Moynahan et al., 2001; Sharan et al., 1997; Venkitaraman, 2000 ) and facilitate restart of stalled replication ( Badie et al., 2010; Lomonosov et al., 2003; Schlacher et al., 2011 )

. For example, PALB2 truncation of 500 amino acids situated between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs and containing both DBDs does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 foci formation in cells during DNA damage ( Sy et al., 2009b ). Since both the BRCA1-binding N-terminal and the BRCA2-interacting WD40 C-terminal domains are retained in this mutant, the results points to the potential importance of DBDs in PALB2 function

., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009b ). The latter localizes at double-stranded DNA break ( DSB ) sites at earlier stage of repair, inhibiting an alternative pathway of non-homologous end joining and initiating homology-directed repair ( HDR ) through recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2/RAD51 ( Prakash et al., 2015 ). PALB2 is often described as the hub for a network of tumor suppressors ( Park et al., 2014b; Sy et al., 2009b )

., 2014 ). Apart from protein-protein interaction domains, BRCA1, −2 and PALB2 proteins also contain DNA binding domains ( DBDs ), the function of which is poorly understood ( Buisson et al., 2010; Dray et al., 2010; Paull et al., 2001; Pellegrini et al., 2002 ). Recently, studies of BRCA1/BARD1 complex interaction with DNA and RAD51 led to the discovery of the BRCA1/BARD1 role in RAD51-mediated strand invasion and D-loop formation ( Zhao et al., 2017 )

., 2011 ), where the ‘miniBRCA2’ construct, including only DBDs with two BRC repeats, was 3–4 times less efficient than ‘midiBRCA2’ which includes PALB2 interaction motif. Moreover, interaction with PALB2 alleviates the requirement of BRCA2 DNA binding, including a deletion of the entire BRCA2 DBD. Here, we demonstrate that mutation of only four DNA-binding residues of PALB2 reduces both RAD51 foci and overall HDR efficiency by 50% in the presence of endogenous BRCA1 and BRCA2

. Alternatively, the PALB2 N-DBD can support a DNA conformation favourable for RAD51 binding to ssDNA or/and nucleation of RAD51 filament, similarly to the prokaryotic RecOR proteins ( Bell et al., 2012; Ryzhikov et al., 2014; Sakai and Cox, 2009 ). The most unexpected finding is the ability of PALB2 to stimulate strand exchange between homologous ss- and dsDNA fragments in the absence of recombinase

., 2006 ). Like BRCA proteins, PALB2 is an essential mammalian protein linked to a similar spectrum of cancers and Fanconi anemia ( Ducy et al., 2019; Pauty et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2007 ). The PALB2 C-terminal WD40 domain interacts with BRCA2 ( Oliver et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2006 ) while the N-terminus forms a complex with BRCA1 ( Zhang et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009b )

. Thus, PALB2 shares several specific structural and DNA-interaction features with both RecA/RAD51 and Rad52 proteins and supports a protein-specific strand exchange reaction. At the same time, PALB2 does not support D-loop formation with supercoiled dsDNA opposite to a full length PALB2. This may be a consequence of the inability to efficiently bind and distort supercoiled dsDNA plasmid through the secondary DNA-binding site

., 2017 ). Most missense mutations in the BRCA2 DBD are pathogenic ( Guidugli et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2005 ). Disruption of DNA binding in a BRCA2 truncation variant lacking the PALB2-binding motif leads to a significant HDR reduction ( Siaud et al., 2011 ). However, deletion of the BRCA2 DBD has a negligible effect when interaction with PALB2 is preserved, highlighting the functional importance of the previously reported DNA-binding property of PALB2 ( Buisson et al

., 2007 ). The strand exchange function of PALB2 may also be important for alternative DNA repair pathways. Indeed, PALB2 supports strand exchange not only with ssDNA, but with ssRNA substrates, and can be involved in transcription-initiated DNA repair. This hypothesis seems particularly attractive in light of the PALB2 interaction with MRG15 and its localization at the sites of actively transcribed genes Bleuyard et al. ( 2017 ).

., 2014b; Sy et al., 2009b ). In addition to BRCA1 and −2 interactions, it contains a chromatin-association motif ( ChAM ) that interacts with histones H3 and H2B ( Bleuyard et al., 2012 ). PALB2 binds MRG15 protein, a component of histone acetyltransferase-deacetylase complexes ( Hayakawa et al., 2010; Sy et al., 2009a ) ; RAD51 and its paralogs RAD51C, RAD51AP1 and XRCC3 ( Dray et al., 2010; Park et al

., 2015 ). Therefore, PALB2 N-DBD represents a novel structural fold that supports strand exchange. While the functional significance of this property remains to be investigated, it further supports the involvement of PALB2 in specific DNA transactions during HDR, similar to the involvement of BRCA1/BARD1 in D-loop formation ( Zhao et al.,2017 )

    Title: Bacterial actin MreB forms antiparallel double filaments
    Abstract: Filaments of all actin-like proteins known to date are assembled from pairs of protofilaments that are arranged in a parallel fashion, generating polarity. In this study, we show that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that adopt an antiparallel arrangement in vitro and in vivo. We provide an atomic view of antiparallel protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB as apparent from crystal structures. We show that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and demonstrate by in vivo site-specific cross-linking the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli. 3D cryo-EM shows that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of Caulobacter MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Finally, the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 are shown to bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double protofilaments.

   ., 2002; Galkin et al., 2012 ). Presumably, the membrane-binding ability of MreB and FtsA constrains their filament architecture to straight ( or slightly bent ), rather than helical, pairs of protofilaments. But how are these filaments arranged? Here, we demonstrate that MreB from Caulobacter crescentus forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments as revealed by crystal structures, an architecture unprecedented among actin-like proteins

., 2013 ). Taken together, our findings describe a novel architecture of actin-like protofilament pairs that is unprecedented among the actin family of proteins, whether of eukaryotic or prokaryotic origin. The straight, antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments ensures that each subunit can interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome. The non-polar nature of MreB filaments explains common assembly and disassembly kinetics for both filament ends

. The mechanism for protofilament formation of C. crescentus MreB is elucidated by crystallography and shown to be reminiscent of that of other actin-like proteins, revealing the typical domain closure upon polymerisation. Finally, co-crystallisation studies of Caulobacter MreB with the antimicrobial reagents A22 and MP265 explain their inhibitory mechanism and shed light on the activation mechanism of ATP hydrolysis during polymerisation.

The antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments of C. crescentus MreB as revealed by the crystal structure ( Figure 1D ) and by EM ( Figure 2A–C ) is unprecedented within the actin family of proteins. It ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments are able to interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ ( van den Ent et al., 2010 )

. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) make the protein ( ΔCcMreBdh ) less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB ( ΔCcMreBdh ) reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft ( Figure 1A; Kabsch and Holmes, 1995 ). Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B

. 02634. 006 Full-length, untagged MreB from C. crescentus ( CcMreB ) binds to a lipid monolayer as a double protofilament as shown by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM, Figure 2A ), similarly to TmMreB ( Salje et al., 2011 ). 2D averaging of images of negatively stained filaments shows double protofilaments interacting with their flat sides ( Figure 2B ), which coincides with other, double-helical actin-like protein filaments ( Popp et al

. To verify that the antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments observed both in EM and in the crystal structure reflects the functional state of MreB in cells, site-specific cross-linking was performed. Cysteine residues were introduced at specific sites in and outside the protofilament interface and mutated MreB was expressed in the MreB knockout strain as described above

. Domain II is structurally the most preserved domain within the actin family of proteins, whereas domain IB is the most diverse. But even this domain is very similar in both Caulobacter MreB and Thermotoga maritima MreB ( TmMreBh, van den Ent et al., 2001 ), superimposing with an RMSD of 0. 97 Å ( Figure 1A ). The protofilament architecture is also very well conserved, with an identical subunit repeat distance of 51

. Actin, MamK, ParM, and the other plasmid-segregating, actin-like proteins form pairs of protofilaments with subunits facing the same direction ( Ozyamak et al., 2013b ). In F-actin, the polar ends exhibit different growth and shrinkage rates and selectively interact with binding partners that affect filament protection or nucleation ( Pollard and Mooseker, 1981; Wegner, 1982; Wang, 1985; Pollard, 1986; Selve and Wegner, 1986; Theriot and Mitchison, 1991 )

. The antiparallel arrangement ensures that the amphipathic helix of each protofilament binds to membranes as shown by cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ). Pairs of protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in Escherichia coli and these are shown to be oriented in an antiparallel fashion by in vivo cross-linking. The mechanism for protofilament formation of C

. The electrostatic surface potential of the double protofilaments reveals the hydrophobic loop and the basic charges surrounding the membrane-binding site ( Figure 1B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02634. 003Table 1.

. In non-spherical bacteria, the actin homologue MreB ( Jones et al., 2001; van den Ent et al., 2001 ) is essential for shape maintenance as depletion of MreB through genetic knockouts or MreB-targeted drug treatment results in misshapen cells that eventually lyse ( Wachi et al., 1987; Levin et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2003; Bendezú and de Boer, 2008 )

. These results demonstrate firstly that MreB protofilament formation is essential for cell shape maintenance and secondly that these protofilaments need to interact with their flat sides to make functional MreB filaments. 10. 7554/eLife. 02634. 011Figure 4. Pairs of MreB protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in E. coli. ( A ) Schematic diagram showing the genetic set-up to examine cell shape maintenance by intra- and inter-protofilament mutants of MreB

. Given the almost surprising high degree of similarity between the structures of MreB from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms ( Figure 1A ), it is expected that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is conserved among the bacterial kingdom. This has far reaching consequences for the molecular mechanism of MreB's function

. In the presence of the antimicrobial agents A22 and MP265, MreB forms single but no double protofilaments ( Figure 7 ). By dislocating one of the dimerisation helices and thereby weakening the inter-protofilament interface, the inhibitor might destabilise the MreB filament. This would explain the disruption of MreB filaments by A22 as reported previously ( Bean et al., 2009; Dye et al., 2011 )

. 1 Å and a similar arrangement of the longitudinal interface ( Figure 1C ). However, only single protofilaments were present in the Thermotoga MreB crystals, despite the fact that electron microscopy images clearly show doublets ( van den Ent et al., 2001 ). In contrast, the crystals of Caulobacter MreB contain doublets that, remarkably, crystallised in an antiparallel arrangement ( Figure 1D )

Structural insight into MreB from mesophilic bacteria has been hampered by the tendency of the proteins to aggregate upon purification, but through biochemical and bioengineering tools sufficient quantities of stable versions of Caulobacter crescentus MreB were obtained ( Table 1 ) that were amenable to structural studies

    Title: The role of APETALA1 in petal number robustness
    Abstract: Invariant floral forms are important for reproductive success and robust to natural perturbations. Petal number, for example, is invariant in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. However, petal number varies in the closely related species Cardamine hirsuta, and the genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. Here we show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 ( AP1 ) can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions: A. thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling petal number in C. hirsuta. We show that C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of A. thaliana AP1, conferring variable petal number, and that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence. Moreover, variable petal number is maintained in C. hirsuta despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers.

   . hirsuta. We show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator AP1 can account for the difference in petal number robustness between species. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions: A. thaliana AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of all petal number QTL in C. hirsuta and, in this way, confers robustness. We show that C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of A

. hirsuta involved regulatory changes in AP1 that relaxed its epistasis over alleles that cause petal number to vary. Therefore, our results suggest that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in C. hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of C. hirsuta. AP1 is an important regulator of A. thaliana flower development, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs ( Bowman et al

In this study, we identified AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals, typified by A. thaliana, to a variable petal number in C. hirsuta. Despite this large effect, AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in C. hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in C

These flowers mimicked the variable petal number found in C. hirsuta, suggesting that there may be variability in the gene regulatory network controlling petal number in A. thaliana that is hidden beneath the uniformity of wild-type development. In C

. This means that floral organs with petal identity show no variation in number if they arise outside the second whorl. As predicted by the ABC model ( Coen and Meyerowitz, 1991 ), we found AP1 ectopically expressed in third whorl petals of ag mutants in C. hirsuta ( Figure 2j ). Therefore, ectopic expression of AP1 is associated with an invariant number of petals, whereas endogenous AP1 expression in whorl two of the C. hirsuta floral meristem is associated with variable petal number

It functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor during floral initiation and later as an activator during sepal and petal initiation, and has been described as a ‘true hub’ in the gene regulatory network that initiates flower development ( Kaufmann et al., 2010 ). We found that AP1 genes from A. thaliana and C. hirsuta diverged in their ability to specify an invariant number of four petals

Rather than restoring four petals like ap1-12; AtAP1::AtAP1:GFP ( Figure 3a ), we found that the distribution of petal number remained variable in ap1-12; ChAP1::ChAP1:GFP flowers ( homogeneity of variance accepted by Levene’s test, p=0. 282; Figure 4a, b ), mimicking the variable petal number found in C. hirsuta. Petal number varied between zero and four, and the average petal number was significantly lower in ap1 plants expressing the AP1 genomic clone from C

We found that this transgene was sufficient to convert C. hirsuta petal number from variable to robust, elevating petal number towards the A. thaliana value of four petals ( pairwise Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, p=2. 4e-08; Figure 3a, d, e )

. hirsuta rather than A. thaliana ( Figures 3a and 4a, b, Mann-Whitney U test p=2. 08e-07 ). In contrast, ChAP1::ChAP1:GFP expression was sufficient to reduce the ectopic flowers in ap1 mutants ( Figure 4b ), indicating that AP1 divergence between C. hirsuta and A. thaliana affected petal number independently of floral meristem identity. Therefore, the results of these gene swaps indicate that C. hirsuta AP1 has a reduced ability to promote four petals when compared to A

. hirsuta flowers ( Figure 2d ), and since distortions of this region have been shown to influence petal initiation in A. thaliana ( Baker et al., 2005; Lampugnani et al., 2012; Lampugnani et al., 2013; Laufs et al., 2004; Mallory et al., 2004 ), the enrichment of C. hirsuta AP1 in this domain might be relevant for petal number variation in C. hirsuta. Our findings suggest that petal number is a robust phenotype in A. thaliana that became decanalized in C

. thaliana AP1 over existing QTL. Based on these results, we propose that AP1 divergence perturbed the genetic equilibrium in C. hirsuta that confers petal number robustness. Given the large effect of the A. thaliana AP1 locus on petal number, it is interesting that endogenous AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to petal number variation in C. hirsuta. Rather, it is the ability of AP1 to exert epistasis over other loci that diverged between A. thaliana and C

. thaliana and C. hirsuta. Specifically, C. hirsuta AP1 transcript levels are reduced in floral tissues and protein abundance is reduced in the small regions of stage four flowers where petals initiate. Robustness to variation in developmental systems is often a consequence of nonlinear dose-response curves between gene activity and phenotype ( Félix and Barkoulas, 2015 )

. hirsuta. However, an alternative possibility is that AP1 divergence indirectly caused petal number to vary within C. hirsuta by altering the robustness of this phenotype to genetic variation. Given that petal number is a canalized trait in A. thaliana and robust to genetic variation ( Figure 1a ), we hypothesized that AP1 divergence may have decanalized petal number in C

. 4e-08; Figure 3a, d, e ). In contrast to this, the distribution of petal number remained variable in C. hirsuta lines expressing the endogenous AP1 locus ( ChAP1::ChAP1:GFP; pairwise Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, p=0. 07: Figure 3a ). This suggests that the function of the endogenous AP1 locus to confer four petals is attenuated in C. hirsuta. Therefore, divergence in AP1 function likely contributed to the variation in petal number between A. thaliana and C

., 2015 ). However, there are few examples ( Rohner et al., 2013 ) where the genetic basis of morphological differences between species can be traced to the release of cryptic variation. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals, typified by A. thaliana, to a variable petal number in C. hirsuta

. Therefore, a particular challenge is to understand the developmental transitions between the robust morphology of individuals within a species, and the variation in form between species. Petal number is a robust trait in flowering plants and usually invariant within species and even higher taxonomic orders. For example, three petals are commonly found in monocots while five petals are characteristic of many core eudicots ( Endress, 2011; Specht et al.,2013 ). However, pet number varies in some species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta, and the genetic basis for this difference is unknown. Here we show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APET1 ( AP ) can account for the species difference in petal robustness. This effect of AP is explained epistatic: A thalian AP confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of trait loci controlling pet number in huta. huta We show that huta AP fails to complement this function of thalian AP, conferring variable petal number and upstream regions of AP contribute to divergence. Moreover, pet number is maintained inuta despite standing genetic variation in accessions to produce four-pet flowers

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the genetic basis for the difference in petal number between Arabidopsis thalian and Cardamine huta. They found that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator AP1 (AP) can account for the species difference in petal robustness. The effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions: A. thalian AP masks the phenotypic expression of pet number QTL in C. huta, conferring robustness. They showed that C. huta AP fails to complement this function of A. th AP, conferring variable pet number and upstream regions of AP contribute to divergence. Moreover, pet number is maintained in C.uta despite standing genetic variation in accessions produce four-pet flowers.

    Title: Proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes
    Abstract: Biosynthesis of insulin – critical to metabolic homeostasis – begins with folding of the proinsulin precursor, including formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. Remarkably, normal pancreatic islets contain a subset of proinsulin molecules bearing at least one free cysteine thiol. In human ( or rodent ) islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum folding environment, non-native proinsulin enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and leptin receptor-deficient mice, the further increase of such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Proinsulin-Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes; indeed, proinsulin Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. We conclude that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with ß-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes.

   . We establish that proinsulin misfolding includes the inability to successfully complete its three internal disulfide bonds, with a subfraction of proinsulin molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues. This population of improperly folded proinsulin molecules enters into aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER, resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes that are for the first time identified in the islets of human beings

., 2012 ), we also examined islets from LepR-Nkx2. 1 KO mice that are deficient for leptin receptor in the hypothalamus but not in the islets ( Ring and Zeltser, 2010 ). Here too, pancreatic islets from these hyperphagic, obese, glucose intolerant animals demonstrated markedly increased abundance of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes with >90% of proinsulin entangled in such complexes ( Figure 4E )

., 2016 ) and rodent islets ( Ishida et al., 2017 ). In this study, we have exploited several independent lines of evidence to establish the presence of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes in the β-cells of human islets and model systems, in states that alter the ER folding environment, and in T2D progression prior to onset of β-cell dedifferentiation ( Bensellam et al., 2018 ) or death ( Eizirik and Millard, 2014; Kanekura et al., 2015; Marchetti et al

. We examined proinsulin in the islet lysates of 5 additional prediabetic LepRdb/db mice — all were similar to the islets of two animals shown in Figures 4D ( 4 and 6 weeks of age with random blood glucose levels of 101 and 118 mg/dL, respectively ) containing a large steady state level of proinsulin ( seen upon Western blotting of reducing SDS-PAGE ) with >90% of molecules entangled in disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes ( seen by Western blotting upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE,

. 1 KO mice ( Figure 5B ). In the islets of young, normoglycemic homozygous LepRdb/db male mice that are destined for diabetes, proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 5C upper left panel ) were increased slightly above the level observed in heterozygous LepRdb/+ males ( that do not progress to diabetes ), and islet insulin levels were similarly increased ( lower left panels )

. Disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers along with a ladder of higher-order complexes already represented the majority of recombinant proinsulin species, and these forms accumulated to a dramatically higher level in cells treated overnight with PERK inhibitor ( Figure 2D ). We then looked for the presence of such disulfide-linked dimers and higher order complexes formed by endogenous proinsulin in preparations of human islets from unrelated donors without a history of T2D

., 2003 ). Indeed, Western blotting of nonreduced lysates of Akita mouse islets with anti-proinsulin demonstrated that the majority of proinsulin was recovered in aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( Figure 1F ), which were converted to monomeric proinsulin upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions

. We note that we have been unable to detect secreted proinsulin that can be alkylated with AMS, or that is recovered in disulfide-linked complexes, even from islets or cells in which proinsulin has accumulated intracellularly in disulfide-linked complexes at massive levels

Both murine islets and the INS1 ( rat ) pancreatic ß-cell line cells secrete successfully-folded proinsulin in addition to processed insulin. Native proinsulin folding requires formation of Cys ( B7 ) -Cys ( A7 ), Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( A20 ) and Cys ( A6 ) -Cys ( A11 ) disulfide pairs ( Haataja et al., 2016 ). One way to detect improperly folded wild-type proinsulin in pancreatic β-cells is to look for the possible presence of unpaired Cys residues

. With increasing time of exposure, the majority of intracellular proinsulin accumulated in disulfide-linked complexes in the ß-cells ( Figure 2A second panel ), and this increase was ultimately accompanied by decreased insulin content ( third panel ) as well as decreased proinsulin secretion ( final panel )

. Nevertheless, the data presented herein establish disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin as one of the earliest tissue biomarkers indicating ß-cell secretory pathway dysfunction, which is associated with ER stress and ultimate insulin deficiency that occurs in the natural progression of T2D.

. Overnight treatment of human islets with PERK inhibitor resulted in a further increase in higher order disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 3A right panel, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) and an increase in total islet proinsulin as revealed by reducing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A left panel ). These data indicate that aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers and higher complexes exist in human islets and their abundance responds to changes in environmental conditions within the ER

. In the islets of humans not known to have T2D, improperly folded disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers were already apparent prior to SubAB addition, and an increase in larger-sized covalent proinsulin complexes was apparent at 4 hr of SubAB treatment ( Figure 3D lower panel ). These data demonstrate an acute increase in improper folding of human proinsulin, without any INS gene mutation, under conditions of BiP deficiency within the ß-cell ER luminal environment

. To determine if Cys ( B19 ) /Cys ( A20 ) are both necessary and sufficient for generating the full ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes, we compared the three different human mutant proinsulins noted above that each retain only one set of potential disulfide partners, and a human proinsulin mutant named ‘lose-B19/A20’ in which Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are mutated whereas positions B7, A7, A11 and A20 remain as cysteines

., 2016 ) ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ), but the availability of free Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) can recapitulate the entire ladder of improperly disulfide linked proinsulin complexes. Several pathways of disulfide propagation are possible, highlighted in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B

. To confirm that even in the absence of INS gene mutations, formation of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes constitutes improper proinsulin folding, we exposed INS1 pancreatic beta cells to PERK inhibitor for times up to 20 hr

. With a random blood glucose level in the mid 200’s ( mg/dL ), islet proinsulin was notably increased ( Figure 5C upper second panel ) and comprised >90% of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( upper first panel ) whereas simultaneously, islet insulin levels were dramatically decreased ( lower left panels ). With a random blood glucose level >500 mg/dL, islet proinsulin and insulin levels were both severely diminished ( Figure 5C left panels )

., 2010; Harding et al., 2012; Scheuner et al., 2005 ). We performed immunoblotting of nonreducing SDS-PAGE samples with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes rodent proinsulin but not insulin ( mAb CCI-17, see Materials and methods ), with the intent to identify intermolecular disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes

. These data indicate that a Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) disulfide is necessary and sufficient for the formation of proins disulfide complexes, and that proins Cys ( B )-Cys ( B ) homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proins complex formation. We conclude that increased proins misfolding via disulf-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that wors with ß-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes

The text is a scientific research article discussing the role of proinsulin misfolding in the progression of type 2 diabetes. Proinsulin is a precursor to insulin, and its proper folding is crucial for metabolic homeostasis. In the pancreas, a subset of proins molecules have unpaired cysteine residues, which form aberrant disulf-linked complexes with other proins. In genetically obese mice and leptin-deficient mice, disulf-linked proins are more abundant and associated with islet deficiency and diabetes. Pro-Cys (19) and Cys (20) are necessary and sufficient for proins disulf-linked complexes, and pro-Cys (19)-Cys (19) homodimers resist reductive dissociation. The study shows that proins misfolding via disulf-linked complexes is an early event in prediabetes that wors with ß-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

    Title: Impact of nucleic acid and methylated H3K9 binding activities of Suv39h1 on its heterochromatin assembly
    Abstract: SUV39H is the major histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) -specific methyltransferase that targets pericentric regions and is crucial for assembling silent heterochromatin. SUV39H recognizes trimethylated H3K9 ( H3K9me3 ) via its chromodomain ( CD ), and enriched H3K9me3 allows SUV39H to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. Here we show that Suv39h1’s CD ( Suv39h1-CD ) binds nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Suv39h1-CD had higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bind nucleic acids was independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Suv39h1 mutational studies indicated that both the nucleic acid–binding and H3K9me–binding activities of Suv39h1-CD were crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. These results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating SUV39H’s target specificity.

    Supporting Text:
   . Collectively, these results indicate that Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid–binding activity integrates and cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish/maintain Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin such as H3K9me3 formation, HP1 accumulation, and transcriptionally repressive status

. We also showed that Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNA in vivo in a manner dependent on its nucleic acid-binding activity and that knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentric heterochromatin. Our data suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to the targeting and retention of Suv39h1 at specific chromosomal regions.

. In addition to its role in establishing H3K9me3, Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity also contributes to Suv39h1’s stable association with H3K9me3-rich pericentromeric regions ( Figure 5 ). Knockdown of major satellite repeat transcripts ( Figure 6 ) further supports the notion that RNA ( major satellite RNA ) binding of Suv39h1 contributes to its stability on chromatin

. Intriguingly, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A interacted partially with the major satellite RNAs. This result does not seemingly fit with our model that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA- and H3K9me3-binding activities cooperatively function in Suv39h1’s chromatin targeting. However, we also found that Suv39h1-Y67A-4A loosely bound chromatin ( see below ). Considering this observation, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A may interact cellular RNAs without stable binding to chromatin

. Furthermore, we found that the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of Suv39h1’s N-terminal region contributed to the Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4C and [Muramatsu et al., 2016] ). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the four different activities of Suv39h1 other than its lysine methyltransferase activity cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly

. Despite having impaired binding of both RNA and methylated H3K9, the Suv39h1 mutant Y67A-4A was able to assemble CH on pericentric regions, although less efficiently and completely than wild-type Suv39h1 ( Figure 3 ). These data indicate that the Y67A-4A mutant retains other critical factors or functions that promote Suv39h1’s association with CH sufficiently for Y67A-4A to induce pericentric heterochromatin assembly

., 2004; Ragunathan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2008 ), it has been suggested that Suv39/Clr4 uses a direct read-write mechanism to maintain the H3K9me3 marks on CH. However, this mechanism alone is not sufficient for converting H3K9me3-free, naïve chromosomal regions to silent heterochromatin. Here we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids, and that this binding is crucial for Suv39h1’s function

. Even more interestingly, a relatively higher level of Suv39h1-Y67A-4A was detected in the soluble fractions ( Figure 4D ). Together, these results confirmed that Suv39h1 interacts with major satellite RNA within the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, and that both RNA- and H3K9me3-binding activities contribute to Suv39h1’s chromatin association

. The ΔN phenotype supports this possibility. In this study we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity is required for its targeting to and assembly of heterochromatin, highlighting the functional role of pericentromeric transcripts in introducing H3K9me3 marks. Recent studies using fission yeast demonstrated that H3K9me3 can be maintained during DNA replication as a self-perpetuating epigenetic mark ( Audergon et al., 2015; Ragunathan et al., 2015 )

. Thus, we concluded that both the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of the N-terminal region also contribute to Suv39h1-mediated heterochromatin assembly. Since Suv39h1-CD had a higher binding affinity for RNA than for DNA in EMSAs ( Figure 1D–G ), and this binding activity appeared to be crucial for Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin formation, we examined whether Suv39h1 binds RNA transcribed from pericentric major satellite repeats inside the cell

. Suv39h-CD prefers to bind ssRNA rather than dsDNA, and Suv39h-CD’s nucleic acid binding is independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Mutational analyses revealed that both the nucleic acid- and H3K9me3-binding activities of Suv39h1 are important for its induction of heterochromatin assembly

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 25317. 015 Since the Suv39h1-4A mutant is defective in major satellite RNA binding and more dynamic on CH in vivo, it is highly possible that major satellite repeat transcripts contribute to the retention of Suv39h1 on heterochromatin. However, the above experiments could not rule out the possibility that Suv39h1-CD targets chromatin via its DNA-binding activity ( Figure 1E )

. Thus, Suv39h1-CD’s function might be dispensable for maintaining H3K9me3 marks once established. However, Suv39h1-4A’s association with major satellite RNA was severely impaired in cells with rescued H3K9me3 and HP1 ( Figure 4 ), suggesting that defective RNA binding may affect Suv39h1 dynamics in the pericentromere, where major satellite repeat elements are transcribed

. In this study, we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD not only recognizes H3K9me3, but also binds RNA and DNA ( with a higher affinity to ssRNA than to dsDNA ), indicating that RNA may also be crucial for Suv39h1 recruitment/function. Indeed, our current data suggest that these two activities contribute to Suv39h1-mediated CH assembly, including the accumulation of H3K9me3 and HP1 ( Figure 3 ) and the retention of Suv39h1 itself on the pericentric regions ( Figure 5 )

. Interestingly, although Suv39h1 mutants ( 4A and Y67A ) failed to interact with major satellite RNA in the RNA-IP experiments ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ), most of these mutants were also detected in the chromatin-enriched fractions ( Figure 4D ), suggesting that Suv39h1 mutants are still associated with chromatin even without being stably bound to major satellite RNA

. This data further supports the notion that major satellite RNAs contribute to Suv39h1 stability on pericentric regions. 10. 7554/eLife. 25317. 016Figure 6. Major satellite RNAs contribute to Suv39h1’s retention on heterochromatin.

., 2016 ) ( Muratsu et al.,2016 ) demonstrated that Suvh39’s N-terminal region is involved in HP-binding and chromatin-binding activities that contribute to S39’s perentric H3me3 formation. Our results are consistent with this study, showing that S39’s N-terminal region is involved in HP-binding and chromatin-binding activities that contribute touvh’s perentric H3me formation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). Collectively, our results indicate that S39’s four activities other than its lysine methyltransferase activity cooperatively regulateuv’s perentric heterochatin assembly

We found that S39-CD has a higher affinity for RNA than DNA in EMSA ( Figure 1D–G ) and that this activity is crucial for S39’s perentric heterochatin formation. We examined whether S39 binds RNA transcribed from peric major satellite repeats inside the cell. S39-CD prefers ssRNA rather than dsDNA and S’s nucleic binding is independent of H3me recognition. Mutational analyses revealed that the nucleic and Hme-binding of S39 are important for heterochatin assembly.
Researchers investigated whether grid cells in the entorinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation, can be activated by attention without physical movement. Monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a moving stimulus in the periphery, and 20.14% of entorinal cells showed spatially structured fields. This contrasts with recordings in the hippocampus, where grid representations were not observed. The study provides evidence that entorinal cells do not rely on physical movement for activation. Grid cells have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive functions beyond navigation, and attention is a prerequisite for this hypothesis. The study tested this by recording from units in the entor cortex of monkeys performing a covert attention task. Monkeys performed the task at>70% accuracy, with most errors due to saccades outside the fixation window. To examine spatial representations in entorinal neurons, the standard grid measure was evaluated. Findings suggest eye movements are not required to activate cells with grid-like fields, and fields in the entor cortex can represent attention location. Future experiments linking grid responses to behavior are critical for understanding the function of the entor cortex. The study's design may underestimate the true percentage of grid cells in entor cortex, as it only detected cells with fields matching the screen size and spacing of the dot's trajectory.

    Title: Standardized and reproducible measurement of decision-making in mice
    Abstract: Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.

    These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, and more generally suggest a path toward improving reproducibility in neuroscience. To study mouse behavior across laboratories, we developed and implemented identical experimental equipment and a standard set of protocols. Not only did mice learn the task in all laboratories, but critically, after learning they performed the task comparably across laboratories

. Mice in different laboratories adopted a comparable reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability. To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, we adopt an open science approach: we describe and share the hardware and software components and the experimental protocols. It is increasingly recognized that data and techniques should be made fully available to the broader community ( Beraldo et al., 2019; Charles et al

. We here present results from a large cohort of mice trained in the task, demonstrating reproducible methods and reproducible results across laboratories. In all laboratories, most mice learned the task, although often at a different pace. After learning they performed the task in a comparable manner, and with no significant difference across laboratories

. Physiological studies of decision making are increasingly carried out in mice to access the unrivaled arsenal of genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for mouse brains ( Carandini and Churchland, 2013; Glickfeld et al., 2014; O'Connor et al., 2009 ). Our collaboration, International Brain Laboratory, 2017, aims to leverage these approaches by exploring the neural basis of the same mouse behavior in multiple laboratories

. Moreover, they will be able to compare each other’s results, knowing that any difference between them is unlikely to be due to differences in behavior. We also hope that these resources catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of our approach, and accelerate the use of mice in high quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making.

. internationalbrainlab. org. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, enabling collaborative studies of brain function in behaving mice.

. Overall, our procedures succeeded in training tens of mice in each laboratory ( Figure 2h ). Indeed, there was a 80% probability that mice would learn the task within the 40 days that were usually allotted, and when mice were trained for a longer duration, the success rate rose even further ( Figure 2h ). There was, however, variability in learning rates across mice and laboratories. This variability is intriguing and would present a challenge for projects that aim to study learning

. The reproducibility of this mouse behavior makes it a good candidate for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying decision making. A reproducible behavioral task can be invaluable to establish the neural basis of behavior. If different studies use the same task, they can directly compare their findings. There are indeed illustrious examples of behavioral tasks that serve this role

. We next ask whether the behavior of trained mice was consistent and reproducible across laboratories. Once mice achieved basic task proficiency, multiple measures of performance became indistinguishable across laboratories ( Figure 3a–e ). We first examined the psychometric curves for the three sessions leading up to proficiency, which showed a stereotypical shape across mice and laboratories ( Figure 3a )

., 2014 ). Behavioral assays can be difficult to reproduce across laboratories even when they share a similar apparatus ( Chesler et al., 2002; Crabbe et al., 1999; Sorge et al., 2014 ). This difficulty is not simply due to genetic variation: behavioral variability is as large in inbred mice as in outbred mice ( Tuttle et al., 2018 ). Difficulties in reproducing mouse behavior across laboratories would hinder the increasing number of studies that investigate decision making in mice

. Success did not seem guaranteed at the outset, because neuroscience faces a crisis of reproducibility ( Baker, 2016; Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020; Button et al., 2013 ) particularly when it comes to measurements of mouse behavior ( Chesler et al., 2002; Crabbe et al., 1999; Kafkafi et al., 2018; Sorge et al., 2014; Tuttle et al., 2018 ). To solve this crisis, three solutions have been proposed: large studies, many teams, and upfront registration ( Ioannidis, 2005 )

. Lastly, we investigated the strategies used by the mice in the basic task and in the full task and asked whether these strategies were similar across mice and laboratories. Mice might incorporate non-sensory information into their decisions, even when such information is not predictive of reward ( Busse et al., 2011; Lak et al., 2020a ). Therefore, even when reaching comparable performance levels, different mice might be weighing task variables differently when making a decision

. Through videography ( Mathis et al., 2018 ) one could classify these movements and perhaps identify behavioral strategies that provide insight in the performance of the task and into the diversity of behavior that we observed across sessions and across mice. We hope that this large, curated dataset will serve as a benchmark for testing better models of decision-making

. Three different classifiers were used to try to predict in which laboratory a mouse was trained based on behavioral metrics: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. We used the scikit-learn implementation available in Python with default configuration settings for the three classifiers. Some labs trained more mice than others resulting in an imbalanced dataset. This imbalance was corrected by taking a random subsample of 8 mice from each laboratory 2000 times

. Variation in performance across laboratories was so low that we were not able to assign a mouse to a laboratory based on performance ( Figure 3f ). Having found little variation in behavioral variables when considered one by one ( Figure 3c–e ), we asked whether mice from different laboratories may exhibit characteristic combinations of these variables. We thus trained a Naive Bayes classifier ( Pedregosa et al

. internationalbrainlab. org, and include all >5 million choices made by the mice. Another element that might have contributed to success is our choice of behavioral task, which places substantial requirements on the mice while not being too complex. Previous failures to reproduce mouse behavior across laboratories typically arose in studies of unconstrained behavior such as responses to pain or stress ( Chesler et al., 2002; Crabbe et al., 1999; Kafkafi et al., 2018; Sorge et al

. Just as in the basic task ( Figure 3 ), a classifier trained on these variables could not predict above chance the origin laboratory of individual mice above chance ( Figure 4j ). Moreover, neither choice fractions nor bias shifts showed within-lab consistency that was larger than expected by chance ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c ). This confirms that mice performed the full task similarly across laboratories

. Mice in different laboratories had similar psychophysical performance in a purely sensory version of the task and adopted similar choice strategies in the full task, where they benefited from tracking the stimulus prior probability. Behavior showed variations across sessions and across mice, but these variations were no larger across laboratories than within laboratories

We begin by describing training in the basic task, where stimuli on the left vs. right appeared with equal probability ( Burgess et al., 2017 ). This version of the task is purely visual, in that no other information can be used to increase expected reward. The training proceeded in automated steps, following predefined criteria ( Figure 1d, IBL Protocol for mice training ). Initially, mice experienced only easy trials with highly visible stimuli ( 100% and 50% contrast )

. Similar results were obtained with two other classifier algorithms ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3d–i ). This consistency across laboratories was not confined to the three sessions that led to proficiency, and was observed both in earlier and in later sessions. We repeated our analyses for three sessions that led to mice achieving a looser definition of proficiency: a single criterion of 80% correct for easy stimuli, without criteria on response bias and contrast threshold

The study aimed to develop a standardized and reproducible task for measuring decision-making in mice, a complex behavior that has been challenging to reproduce across laboratories. The researchers adopted a perceptual value-based decision-making task and standardized protocols, hardware, software, and procedures, and trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries. The results showed that mice learned the task at different rates, but once trained, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice from different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide their choices. This demonstrates that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools for studying decision-making in mice. The study also suggests a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open science approaches.

The researchers used an open science approach, sharing hardware, software, and protocols to facilitate reproducibility. They implemented identical equipment and protocols across laboratories and found that mice performed the task comparably after learning. Mice in different laboratories adopted comparable reliance on visual, past, successes, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide their choices. The study used a large cohort of mice, trained in the task, demonstrating reproducible methods and reproducible results across laboratories. The results indicate that physiological studies of decision-making can be carried out in mice, leveraging the arsenal of genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for brains.

The study also investigated strategies used by mice in the basic and full task and asked whether these were similar across mice and laboratories. Mice might incorporate non-sensory information into decisions, even when information is not predictive of reward. The study used videography to classify movements and identify behavioral strategies providing insight into performance and diversity across sessions and mice. The large, curated dataset will serve as a benchmark for testing models of decision-making.

    Title: Cell-type diversity and regionalized gene expression in the planarian intestine
    Abstract: Proper function and repair of the digestive system are vital to most animals. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in these processes requires an atlas of gene expression and cell types. Here, we applied laser-capture microdissection ( LCM ) and RNA-seq to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate all organs, including the gut. We identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Furthermore, spatial LCM enabled us to uncover previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Finally, we identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration ( hedgehog signaling effector gli-1 ) or maintenance ( RREB2 ) of goblet cells. Altogether, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair and regeneration.

   . In addition, we identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for production and/or maintenance of goblet cells, setting the stage for further studies of this cell type. The planarian intestinal transcriptome is a foundational resource for investigating numerous aspects of intestine regeneration and physiology

., 2015 ). Finally, we identified intestine-enriched transcription factors that play distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance, and found that depletion of goblet cells reduces planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with only negligible effects on regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues. Characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome provides a framework for several next steps

We have developed methods for applying laser-capture microdissection to planarian tissue, which we used to define gene expression and cell types in the intestine ( Figure 9A–C ). The intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, innate immunity, and other physiological roles, demonstrating considerable functional homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans

. First, a detailed description of intestinal cell types will facilitate further studies of digestive cell types. Here, we identified two transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, whose RNAi phenotypes suggest that distinct mechanisms govern differentiation and maintenance of goblet cells. We are unaware of studies in other organisms that have uncovered direct roles for either gli-1 or RREB2 in goblet cells

. These observations reinforce the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and indicate that physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs are consolidated in the planarian intestine. Definition of the intestinal transcriptome enables identification of genes required for regeneration and functions of distinct intestinal cell types

., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018; Plass et al., 2018 ), provides a rich list of candidate regulators for further elucidation of differentiation, maintenance, and functions of planarian digestive cells and their progenitors. Second, functional analysis of intestine-enriched transcripts will help to resolve the intestine’s role in regulation of the stem cell microenvironment. Knockdowns of the intestine-enriched TFs nkx2

. The planarian intestine is a prominent organ whose highly branched morphology, simple cellular composition, and likely cell non-autonomous role in neoblast regulation make it a compelling model for addressing fundamental mechanisms of regeneration

. Thus, although characterization of the precise roles of gli-1 and RREB2 will be required, our results suggest broad similarity between planarians and other animals with respect to evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that govern cell dynamics in the digestive tract. Furthermore, although we focused on goblet cells, previous studies suggest that several genes ( gata4/5/6-1, hnf4, egfr-1, PTF1A ) expressed by cycling neoblast subpopulations ( Barberán et al., 2016; Wagner et al

. Knockdown of mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 21 ( med 21 ) reduced goblet cells and blastema formation ( Supplementary file 5C ), but also caused severe disruption of intestinal integrity in our previous study ( Forsthoefel et al., 2012 ). This suggested a non-goblet-cell-specific role, and we did not investigate med21 further. Knockdown of a second transcription factor, gli-1 ( a transducer of hedgehog signaling [Rink et al., 2009; Glazer et al

. pre-existing intestine ). These complex observations suggest that mechanisms regulating goblet cell differentiation and maintenance may differ during homeostasis and regeneration, or that compensatory mechanisms capable of sustaining goblet cell production/survival in uninjured gli-1 ( RNAi ) and RREB2 ( RNAi ) animals are insufficient to meet the increased demand for new tissue during regeneration

. Together, these results suggest that gli-1 regulates neoblast fate specification and/or differentiation of neoblast progeny into goblet cells in new intestinal branches, while RREB2 may control maintenance or survival of goblet cells after they initially differentiate

. To facilitate exploration of the planarian intestinal transcriptome as a resource, we have developed a website, plangut. omrf. org. The methods and resources presented here will also support comparative analyses, complementing current and future efforts to understand digestive tract regeneration in platyhelminths, sea cucumbers, annelids, ascidians, amphibians, and mammals ( Goodchild, 1956; O'Steen, 1958; Takeo et al., 2008; Kaneko et al

. Reasoning that transcription factors ( TFs ) would regulate goblet cell generation and/or maintenance, we next focused on transcripts encoding 22 intestine-enriched TFs, only 10 of which were previously known to be enriched in intestinal cells ( Supplementary file 5C ). Using FISH, we validated expression of all but one of these TFs in the intestine ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 )

. In order to understand whether putative functional roles above are performed by specific intestinal cell types or domains, we also analyzed GO term over-representation among transcripts enriched in scRNA-Seq data ( Fincher et al., 2018 ), and in laser-captured medial and lateral intestinal tissue

. laser-captured intestine plots ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–H ). Similarly, the majority of phagocyte-enriched transcripts detected in our earlier study ( Forsthoefel et al., 2012 ) were also enriched in laser-captured intestine ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, we identified 809 intestine-enriched transcripts that single-cell studies did not find to be enriched in the intestine ( or for some, any planarian cell type ) ( Figure 5C )

., 2018 ), and PTF1A also reduces basal intestinal cell numbers ( Fincher et al., 2018 ). Thus, although our data support a role for gli-1 and RREB2 in goblet cells and/or their precursors, they also raise the possibility that basal cells ( and possibly phagocytes or muscle cells ) may non-autonomously influence goblet cell differentiation and/or survival. We asked whether goblet cell depletion affected planarian viability, behavior, or regeneration

., 2015 ), while the RREB-1 ortholog hindsight/pebbled suppresses midgut intestinal stem cell proliferation and is required for differentiation of absorptive enterocytes ( Baechler et al., 2016 ). In planarians, hedgehog ( Hh ) regulates anteroposterior polarity, neoblast proliferation, and neurogenesis ( Rink et al., 2009; Yazawa et al., 2009; Currie et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016 ) ; our data suggest a possible additional role for Hh in intestinal morphogenesis

. In order to globally characterize functional classes of genes expressed in the planarian intestine, we assigned Gene Ontology ( GO ) Biological Process ( BP ) terms to planarian transcripts based on homology to human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila, and C. elegans genes, and then identified over-represented terms among intestine-enriched transcripts ( Figure 6, Figure 6—source data 1A, and Supplementary file 3 )

. Comparison of gene expression in microdissected tissue to that of intestinal phagocytes ( previously isolated by sorting ) enabled identification of transcripts enriched in two other cell types: goblet cells and basal cells. We also discovered previously unappreciated intestinal cell-type diversity, especially amongst goblet cells, which reside in distinct medial and lateral intestinal domains

. However, in mice, modulation of Sonic Hedgehog ( an upstream activator of Gli-family TFs ) levels affects goblet cell numbers ( Gagné-Sansfaçon et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2012 ), and RREB1 cooperatively regulates expression of the peptide hormone secretin in enteroendocrine cells ( Ray et al., 2003 ). By contrast, in the Drosophila midgut, Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling promotes intestinal stem cell proliferation ( Tian et al

A novel mechanism of peripheral sensory coding has been discovered in weakly electric fish, where receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. This mechanism is distinct from spiking receptors, which are specialized for detecting signals from individuals and encoding information to identify the sender. Oscillatory receptors are tuned to lower frequencies than the peak frequencies of conspecific electric organ discharges (EODs) and are sensitive to interpulse intervals (IPIs) that can only be produced by groups of fish. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of receptor sensitivity, suggesting a novel coding mechanism for detecting signals from large groups. Oscillatory activity is widespread in neural networks and may contribute to distinguishing self-generated stimuli from external stimuli while maximizing sensitivity to external stimuli. Spontaneous oscillations across receptors are asynchronized in the absence of an electric stimulus, but reset when the fish emits its EOD, all receptors experience stimuli of identical polarity based on the direction of current flow. Evolutionary change in sensory systems can have profound effects on perception and behavior, and this study provides evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony at the periphery.

    Title: A new topology of the HK97-like fold revealed in Bordetella bacteriophage by cryoEM at 3.5 Å resolution
    Abstract: Bacteriophage BPP-1 infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough. Its diversity-generating retroelement ( DGR ) provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts are hampered without atomic structures. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy structure of the BPP-1 head at 3. 5 Å resolution. Our atomic model shows two of the three protein folds representing major viral lineages: jellyroll for its cement protein ( CP ) and HK97-like ( ‘Johnson’ ) for its major capsid protein ( MCP ). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We illustrate that the new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.

   . An atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive of stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses. In this study, we report the three-dimensional ( 3D ) structure of the BPP-1 head at ∼3. 5 Å resolution determined by single-particle cryoEM and derived an atomic model

., 1985; Chelvanayagam et al., 1992 ), and subsequently found widely in other DNA viruses, such as ϕX174, bacteriophage PRD1 and human adenovirus ( McKenna et al., 1992; Abrescia et al., 2004; Zubieta et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2010; Krupovic and Bamford, 2011 ). Unlike its role as the major capsid protein in the above-mentioned viruses, the jellyroll motif in BPP-1 forms an auxiliary protein to stabilize the viral capsid made by proteins of another fold

We found that BPP-1 CP and MCP adopt two of the three characteristic folds of major virus lineages, jellyroll, and HK-97/Johnson. Moreover, the topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted as compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold. Until now, the Johnson fold has been observed at atomic detail in the Siphoviridae and Myoviridae families of the three tailed-bacteriophage families, exemplified by gp5 of HK97 ( Siphoviridae ) ( Wikoff et al

. 5 Å resolution map ( Baker et al., 2013 ) to bear the same BPP topology as we initially reported ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) and detailed further in this study. As described in the results above, the BPP topology and HK97 topology represent the only two feasible topologies of the Johnson fold ( Figure 5 ). To date, all other known atomic structures of proteins with the Johnson fold adopt the HK97 topology, including gp5 of HK97 in Siphoviridae ( Wikoff et al

., 2007; Lander et al., 2008 ). Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a short-tailed, dsDNA virus and a member of the Podoviridae family. It infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. It has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, ∼670 Å in diameter. A 7 Å resolution cryoEM structure of BPP-1 showed that its capsid protein has an HK97-like fold, but the shell has an additional protein component ( Dai et al., 2010 )

Capsid proteins of non-enveloped viruses fall, so far, into three major structural classes: the β-jellyroll, the HK97 fold, and the fold of dsRNA-virus shell proteins ( Bamford et al., 2005; Oksanen et al., 2012 ). The RNA bacteriophage MS2 subunits have a fourth structure, not yet found in eukaryotic viruses ( Valegard et al., 1990 )

., 2005; Abrescia et al., 2012 ). Our result suggests that BPP-1 is likely a hybrid virus that has adopted the characteristic structures from both the jellyroll and HK97 lineages. The head of bacteriophage Epsilon15 also contains two capsid proteins ( gp7 and gp10 ) located at similar positions as CP ( Bbp16 ) and MCP ( Bbp17 ) in BPP-1

Finally, to verify that genes bbp16 and bbp17 encode components essential for forming infectious phage particles, we constructed in-frame deletions of the bbp16 and bbp17 genes

. Notably, in some dsRNA viruses, the jellyroll motif has been adopted as a domain in a stabilizer/adaptor protein that forms trimers located at an intermediate layer of viral capsids ( Grimes et al., 1998; Mathieu et al., 2001; Liemann et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2010a ). In BPP-1, CP subunits form a dimer through β-sheet augmentation between the F-strands of two CHEF sheets, forming an 8 stranded β-sheet visible on the external surface ( Figure 3C )

., 2010 ). Lacking information at the time about their genetic identities, these proteins were named according to their structural roles: a major capsid protein ( MCP ) and a ‘cement protein’ ( CP ) that decorates the shell. From a biotechnology standpoint, BPP-1 has emerged as an attractive phage-display system thanks to its unique and well characterized diversity-generating retro-element ( DGR )

. Although the BIDG sheet of the jellyroll motif faces but do not interact with the underneath MCP shell, instead, as described in detail below, CP interacts with the MCP shell mainly through its N- and C-termini as well as a linking loop between its β-strands B and C. We traced 327 amino acid residues ( Ser5 to Val331 ) of the total 331 residues of the major capsid protein Bbp17 in the cryoEM density map ( Figure 4; Video 3 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01299. 010 The topological organization of strands in the two β sheets ( i. e., BIDG and CHEF; Figure 3B ) of CP is identical to that of the jellyroll motif. This structural motif was first discovered in spherical RNA viruses ( Harrison et al., 1978; Abad-Zapatero et al., 1980; Hogle et al., 1985; Rossmann et al., 1985; Chelvanayagam et al

. Indeed, we observed infectious phage particle formation when either CP or MCP was fused to a peptide of 22 amino acids at their C-terminus ( HG and JFM, unpublished observation ). As BPP-1 DGRs diversify DNA sequences in vivo, this suggests they may be engineered to display heterologous sequences on the phage capsid by fusion to the termini of CP or MCP

. In particular, many side chains in the ‘interchanged model’ do not match those resolved in the cryoEM density map ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, C ). This verification provides additional support to the BPP topology established by our de novo modeling approach. Interchange of two of the structural elements can lead to proteins with different topologies of the Johnson fold ( Figure 5C )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01299. 017 As remarked above, despite of the similar architectural appearance ( or fold ) of BPP-1 Bbp17 and HK97 gp5, the two proteins have different topologies of the Johnson fold ( Figure 5 ). The topology of B-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the topology of HK gp5 ( Figure 5 ). This is the first time the Johnson fold has been observed in a non-circular permuted topology in a viral protein. In contrast, all other proteins with the Johnson fold have the HK topology ( Figure 5 ), including gp of HK97 Siphiridae ( Wik et al. 2007; Lander et al. 2008 ) and gp of T4 phage35 ( et al. 201 ). The topology of B- MCP is likely the only feasible alternative of the topology of the fold ( Figure 5 )
Researchers used serial passage of deng virus (DENV) in human and mosquito cell lines to examine how populations adapt to different host environments. They estimated the effects of single nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing and determined the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. The analysis revealed a continuous influx of deleterious mutations balances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations shaping adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster in defined regions of the genome. These phenotyp redundant alleles facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints in this system mirror observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term evolution.

The study quantified the cost of deleterious mutations across the DENV genome, highlighting negative selection shapes diversity in viral populations. The analysis of allele reveals fitness represents a balance between beneficial and deleterious mutations during adaptation. Adaptation relies on host-specific mutations clustered in regions of DENV and enriched in flexible regions of the proteome. CirSeq was used to characterize fitness landscapes of D populations adapting to human and mosquito cells by tracing allele trajectories of single nucleotide variants across the genome. This reveals influence of positive and negative selection shaping evolutionary paths in distinct environments. Beneficial mutations were clustered in specific locations, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host selection. The fitness of these hotspots was mapped on the three-dimensional structure of DENV protein, a transmembrane protein forming the outer layer of the envelope.

Adaptive mutations were largely excluded from transmembrane and structured regions of D proteins. Structural integrity places constraints on variation in these regions. The sequence of arviral domains is poised to optimize function in distinct environments. The study reveals biophysical constraints shaping the D adaptive landscape and constraining diversity. The distribution of allele over adaptation reflects the rate of new mutations and strength of selection. Viral untranslated regions exhibit host-specific patterns, consistent with roles in the life cycle. Human D UTRs were more brittle but contained beneficial than mosquito populations, suggesting strong selection.
Researchers used single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (s-PALM) to study the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12, an active Ras mutant, on the membrane of U2 cells. They found that KRas12 exhibits three distinct diffusion states: a fast, immobile, and intermediate. The immobile state is ~70 nm in size, embedded in a larger domain ~200 nm that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KRas12 is continuously removed from the membrane via immobile and replenished to fast, reminiscent of internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRas12 remain invariant over a broad range of expression levels. The study reveals how membrane organization dictates diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offers insight into spatial regulation of Ras signaling.

The researchers used s-PAL and trajectory analysis to uncover details of KR12 localization and interaction with the membrane. Results suggest KR12 diffusion on membrane is best recapitulated by a model comprising three states: fast, immobile, and intermediate. Leveraging large diffusion trajectories, they mapped locations KR12 exhibits specific states. Membrane nanodomains have been implicated in regulation of cellular processes such as Ras signaling, but studying complex membrane compartments in living cells has been a challenge. A mechanistic understanding is important for understanding Ras functions on membrane, as Ras multimers have been implicated in signaling.

The study found KR12 membrane is a non-equilibrium state, constitutively removed through immobile and replenished fast, potentially coupled to trafficking via endocytosis and recycling. Single-particle tracking complements static imaging by providing molecular motions and has been used to study Ras dynamics on membrane. The rationale is interactions Ras with different domains and partners manifest varied behavior. Researchers combined s-PAL with trajectory to reveal previously aspects of Ras on membrane. Based findings propose a model for membrane and trafficking as shown in Figure. In this model, Ras experiences three environments: regular membrane freely diffuses, transition with increased viscous drag, and immobile where interacts with static molecules.

KR12 partition into three states remains invariant over wide expression, demonstrating diffusion and trafficking through mobility and nanodomains maintained homeostatic. Data paint a picture of spatiemporal KR12 on membrane, basis understanding mechanisms multimer and signaling. With diffusion defined, demonstrated intermediate and imm states KR12 associated distinct membrane. Sizes immobilization and domains KR12 ~70 and ~200, consistent beliefs nanoscopic membrane regulate organization membrane.

    Title: Systems biology derived source-sink mechanism of BMP gradient formation
    Abstract: A morphogen gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) signaling patterns the dorsoventral embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates for BMP gradient formation is through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often along with ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. To delineate the mechanism in zebrafish, we precisely quantified the BMP activity gradient in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Our analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a bmp transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Surprisingly, rather than supporting a counter-gradient mechanism, our analyses support a fourth model, a source-sink mechanism, which relies on a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

    Supporting Text:
   . To identify the mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in the zebrafish embryo, we established a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient. We integrated the results with a mathematical modeling approach, using the experiments to inform our model selection. The modeling then provided information on key parameters to measure to identify the mechanism by which the BMP signaling gradient is formed

. The recent observation that bmp2b and bmp7a are expressed in a graded manner in WT embryos has lead to the hypothesis that the BMP signaling gradient may largely reflect the bmp expression gradient ( Ramel and Hill, 2013 ). We sought to determine if the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is predominantly established by matching the bmp expression gradient. Three results do not support this hypothesis

. Through quantification and modeling, we present a new view of the mechanism that the BMP antagonists and ligand use to establish the BMP signaling gradient patterning the DV axis in zebrafish.

., 2013; Rogers and Schier, 2011 ). Bone Morphogenetic Proteins ( BMPs ) act as morphogens repeatedly during development, including in patterning the embryonic DV axis, the neural tube, and the Drosophila wing disc ( Bier and De Robertis, 2015; Briscoe and Small, 2015; Rogers and Schier, 2011 ). BMP morphogen systems are established by a network of extracellular regulators ( Dutko and Mullins, 2011 )

. In vertebrates, the mechanism by which the BMP ligands and antagonists shape this gradient is unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed: 1 ) an inverse gradient of BMP antagonists imparts the shape of the BMP signaling gradient ( Figure 1C ) ( Blitz et al., 2000; Connors et al., 1999; Little and Mullins, 2006; Thomsen, 1997 ), 2 ) BMP antagonists generate the peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions ( Figure 1B, D ) ( Ben-Zvi et al

. Combining the P-Smad5 data with a computational screen of mathematical models showed that shuttling of BMP during DV patterning does not shape the gradient, and that a gradient of bmp transcription cannot account for the gradient of BMP signaling activity. From these results, we conclude that the signaling gradient patterning the vertebrate DV axis is generated by either a source-sink or counter-gradient mechanism

. The zebrafish gradient is established gradually in ~2–3 hr and maintained for several hours ( Ramel and Hill, 2013; Tucker et al., 2008 ), whereas the Drosophila BMP signaling gradient is established and patterns DV tissues in ~1 hr ( Dorfman et al., 2001; Wang and Ferguson, 2005 )

. The zebrafish BMP signaling gradient is broad, reaching half of its maximum at ~40% of the total DV axis length ( Figure 2F ). In contrast, the Drosophila gradient is incredibly steep, reaching half of its peak at only ~10% of the total embryo DV axis length ( Figure 9A ) ( Peluso et al., 2011; Sutherland et al., 2003 )

., 2008; Zhang et al., 2007 ). The transcriptional profiles of zebrafish BMP components at the onset of gastrulation resemble that of the Drosophila embryo ( Dutko and Mullins, 2011; O'Connor et al., 2006 ). In Drosophila, sog is expressed ventral-laterally while the BMP ligand dpp is expressed dorsally ( Figure 1A )

. To illustrate the distinct manners by which a source-sink and counter-gradient mechanism would generate the zebrafish BMP signaling gradients observed, we graphically display in Figure 10 the relative contributions of BMP and Chordin diffusion and BMP-Chordin binding to gradient formation for the median simulations that fit our WT, chordin mutant, chordin +/-, and Bmp2b-Venus FRAP data

. Figure 7L, M ) to reach the dorsal sink. Together, these effects show that the shape of the bmp expression domain contributes to BMP gradient formation even if it does not entirely account for it, similar to that found for the bicoid transcript and protein gradients that pattern the Drosophila AP axis ( Little et al., 2011 )

. A BMP ligand lifetime of 30 to 50 min is inconsistent with the low BMP half-lives required for the counter-gradient simulations, but consistent with the BMP half-lives of source-sink simulations ( Figure 8H ), suggesting that the source-sink mechanism much more likely establishes the BMP signaling gradient patterning the zebrafish DV axis. Finally, we asked whether the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms are robust to uniform chordin expression

. BMP signaling patterns prospective head and rostral trunk DV axial tissues during late blastula to mid-gastrula stages at ~5 to 7 hr post fertilization ( hpf ) in the zebrafish ( Hashiguchi and Mullins, 2013; Kwon et al., 2010; Tuazon and Mullins, 2015; Tucker et al., 2008 ). We quantified the BMP signaling gradient at 30 min intervals across this period. We found that the ventral-most 30˚ undergoes about a 2-fold intensification from 4. 7 to 6. 7 hpf ( Figure 2F )

. For the simulations performed where the bmp expression domain matched the signaling gradient, distinct biophysical requirements were also observed for each mechanism. The source-sink mechanism required BMP to have a high range, while the transcriptional mechanism required BMP to have a lower range ( Figure 5I )

The shape of the BMP signaling gradient differs greatly between Drosophila and zebrafish DV patterning ( Figure 9A ). The parameters that drive the most significant difference between the Drosophila-like and zebrafish simulations are the mobility and processing rates of BMP-Chordin ( Figures 7I and 9D, F )

. A crucial class of these regulators is the BMP antagonists, defined by their ability to bind BMP ligand with high affinity, thereby blocking ligand-receptor interaction ( Brazil et al., 2015 ). During axial patterning in zebrafish and Xenopus, three antagonists, Chordin, Noggin, and Follistatin play key roles in inhibiting BMP signaling to promote dorsal cell fate specification ( Dal-Pra et al., 2006; Khokha et al., 2005; Schulte-Merker et al., 1997 )

. While the source-sink gradient mechanism is also modulated by Chordin, Chordin instead acts in a distinct manner as a sink, binding BMP ligand predominantly in dorsal regions, thus allowing a BMP diffusive gradient to form throughout most of the ventral half of the embryo. Key to deriving this alternate model was the integrated approach used that combined quantitative experimental analysis with computational modeling

., 2011 ). Although we and most others in the vertebrate field have contended that a Chordin ( or BMP antagonist ) counter-gradient drives formation of the BMP activity gradient in DV patterning, our studies here, intriguingly, suggest that an alternate source-sink mechanism may prevail

., 2011; Sutherland et al., 2003 ). Similarly, the loss of the main BMP antagonist in either organism, Chordin or Sog, causes markedly different effects on the BMP signaling gradient ( Figure 9A ) ( Mizutani et al., 2005; Peluso et al., 2011; Sutherland et al., 2003 ). Zebrafish and Drosophila DV patterning differ in both length-scale and time-scale. The Drosophila embryo has a 250 µm half-circumference, while the zebrafish embryo has a 700 µm half-circumference

. We now know that the mechanisms by which morphogen gradients are established are diverse and complex, and that understanding these mechanisms is paramount to understanding developmental biology ( Briscoe and Small, 2015; Müller et al., 2013; Rogers and Schier,201 )

    Title: The lysosomal transporter MFSD1 is essential for liver homeostasis and critically depends on its accessory subunit GLMP
    Abstract: Lysosomes are major sites for intracellular, acidic hydrolase-mediated proteolysis and cellular degradation. The export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products is facilitated by polytopic transmembrane proteins mediating secondary active or passive transport. A number of these lysosomal transporters, however, remain enigmatic. We present a detailed analysis of MFSD1, a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal family member of the major facilitator superfamily. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated. It contains a dileucine-based sorting motif needed for its transport to lysosomes. Mfsd1 knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from Mfsd1 knockout mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact. GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. Glmp knockout mice mimic the phenotype of Mfsd1 knockout mice. Our data reveal a tightly linked MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex.

    Supporting Text:
   . Previous proteomic studies identified a large number of novel putative lysosomal transporters ( Chapel et al., 2013 ), and in this study, we characterized one of those candidate transporters, MFSD1 in detail. We identified GLMP as an essential accessory subunit of MFSD1 and establish an essential role of GLMP and MFSD1 in the homeostasis of the liver and particularly LSECs

. These data indicate that MFSD1 is likely not a transporter for any of the tested amino acids at least under the tested conditions. We next investigated how the deficiency of MFSD1 affects the composition of the lysosomal proteome. Lysosomes from three wildtype and three Mfsd1 KO mice were isolated from the liver by differential centrifugation followed by sucrose-gradient centrifugation after injection of the mice with Tyloxapol

. In summary, MFSD1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady state conditions, is not N-glycosylated, is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues and its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus. In order to determine the physiological functions of MFSD1, we generated Mfsd1 knockout ( KO ) mice

. By means of differential proteomics of isolated liver lysosomes from wildtype and Mfsd1 KO mice, we identified GLMP as an essential accessory protein for MFSD1. GLMP is a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of so far unknown function. Deficiency of Mfsd1 leads to drastically reduced levels of GLMP and vice versa

., 2007 ). Chapel et. al. particularly aimed to identify lysosomal transporters and one of their top candidates was ‘Major facilitator superfamily domain containing 1’ ( MFSD1 ). MFSD1 is a poorly characterized protein. It belongs to the major facilitator superfamily ( MFS ) of transporters, one of the two largest family of transporter proteins mediating secondary active or passive transport processes over cellular membranes ( Pao et al., 1998 )

. These data suggest that the interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP is not entirely essential for their trafficking to lysosomes and both proteins can still reach lysosomes in the absence of the other interaction partner. Finally we evaluated if a blockage of lysosomal proteolysis can rescue MFSD1 levels in Glmp KO MEFs ( Figure 6F )

. In conclusion, MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact, their transport to lysosomes does not essentially depend on each other and the stability MFSD1 against lysosomal proteolysis depends on GLMP. A schematic representation of the two interacting partners is shown in Figure 6H.

. However, while it is reasonable to assume that the accumulation of a toxic substrate or dysfunction of lysosomes due to the loss of the transporter function of MFSD1 is the underlying cause for the observed severe phenotype in Mfsd1 and Glmp KO mouse strains, we cannot provide final certainty for this hypothesis. We cannot finally exclude that GLMP might also interact with other ( lysosomal membrane ) proteins or provides general stability for the lysosomal membrane like LAMP proteins do

. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact and Glmp-deficient mice resemble a phenocopy of Mfsd1 KO mice suggesting the MFSD1/GLMP complex to be a stable and functional relevant lysosomal transporter complex.

., 2014; Schieweck et al., 2009 ). GLMP is a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein previously shown to be a component of the lysosomal membrane ( Schieweck et al., 2009 ). In order to validate our proteomics-based findings, we detected GLMP by immunoblot with an antibody raised against its luminal domain ( Figure 3D, E ). In confirmation with our proteomics data, GLMP was undetectable in isolated liver lysosomes from Mfsd1 KO mice

. It harbors a dileucine-based sorting motif in its cytosolic N-terminus which is required for its transport to lysosomes. In order to decipher the physiological function of MFSD1, we generated and analyzed Mfsd1 knockout ( KO ) mice. MFSD1-deficient mice develop a severe liver disease characterized by extravasation of erythrocytes, sinusoidal damage, loss of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs ) and finally signs of fibrosis

., 2018 ). Most accessory-/ β-subunits are essential for the stability of their corresponding transporters, but additionally mediate at least in part the intracellular sorting of their corresponding polytopic transmembrane interaction partner. Our data show that the sorting of ectopically expressed GLMP in Mfsd1 KO cells or MFSD1 in Glmp KO cells to lysosomes is not critically altered, but that instead the stability against lysosomal proteolysis of MFSD1 is altered in Glmp KO cells

. These data show that the dileucine motif in the cytosolic N-terminus is critical for the sorting of MFSD1 to lysosomes. We wondered if MFSD1, similar to the great majority of lysosomal membrane proteins ( Saftig and Klumperman, 2009 ), is N-glycosylated. MFSD1 contains two putative N-glycosylation sites ( N76 and N449 )

. These data also implicate that the interaction of MFSD1 and GLMP is essential for the stability of both proteins, but might additionally affect post-Golgi-sorting. We therefore analyzed if either MFSD1 or GLMP are properly transported to lysosomes in MEFs with a KO of the other interaction partner

. In line with these experiments, immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with the wildtype MFSD1-HA cDNA, but not the PM-localized MFSD1LL/AA–HA mutant showed the proteolytic fragments ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ), indicating that they are not due to misfolding or destabilization of MFSD1 in pre-lysosomal compartments, but occur specifically in lysosomes if GLMP is limiting

The understanding of the lysosomal proteome has considerably improved in the past years. However, there is still a major gap of knowledge about the nature of polytopic transporter proteins, mediating the transport of metabolites between the lysosomal lumen and the cytosol. This is surprising, given the lack of knowledge of the lysosomal transporters for most amino acids, peptides, monosaccharides and several other small solutes

. The major goal of this study was to identify the substrate ( s ) of MFSD1 by analyzing KO mice, assuming that a substrate accumulates in lysosomes. The phenotype of Mfsd1 KO mice is complex and the liver phenotype did not resemble that observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases. We failed to detect any signs of typical lysosomal storage like aberrant storage material or enlarged lysosomes in the liver or MEFs

. We identified a dileucine-based lysosomal sorting motif close to the cytosolic N-terminus of murine MFSD1 ( amino acid 7–12, EDRALL ) that is highly conserved among different species and bears similarity to motifs found in MFSD8 and SLC17A5/Sialin, structurally related lysosomal transporters ( Figure 1F, G, H )

., 2013; Palmieri et al., 2011 ). However, there are also reports showing non-lysosomal localization of MFSD1 at the plasma membrane of neurons and the Golgi-apparatus ( Perland et al., 2017; Valoskova et al., 2019 ). In this study, we provide a detailed biochemical characterization of MFSD1. Endogenous MFSD1 is localized in lysosomes. It contains 12 transmembrane domains and it is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues

. OSTM1 stabilizes CLC-7 but is also essential for mediating the trafficking of the CLC-7/OSTM1 complex from the ER to lysosomes ( Lange et al., 2006 ). Finally, we tested if blockage of lysosomal proteolysis can rescue MF1 levels in Gl KO MEFs ( Figure 6F ). Our data indicate that the interaction between MF1 and GL is not essential for their trafficking to lysosomes and that stability of MF1 against lysosomal proteolysis depends on GL. A schematic of the interacting partners is shown in Figure 6.

    Title: High-resolution structures of kinesin on microtubules provide a basis for nucleotide-gated force-generation
    Abstract: Microtubule-based transport by the kinesin motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, is essential for a wide range of vital processes in eukaryotes. We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5–6 Å resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved ‘linchpin’ residue in kinesin ( N255 ), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's ‘neck linker’ element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules.

    Supporting Text:
   . This mechanism would thus allow microtubules to regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, yielding an elegant structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. A number of sites in the kinesin fold have been identified that uncouple the motor's nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, but the structural basis of the uncoupling has remained unclear

In order to clarify the mechanism of kinesin's microtubule-attached cycle, we solved high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human monomeric kinesin motor domain ( K349 ) attached to the microtubule in two different chemical states ( Figure 1B ), representing the motor before and after ATP binding ( no-nucleotide and in the presence of ADP•aluminum fluoride ( ADP•Al•Fx ) )

. No-nucleotide and ATP-bound models of the kinesin-microtubule complex ( this work ) are depicted in panels A, D, G and B, E, H ( respectively ). A pair of X-ray crystal structures of the ADP-bound kinesin K349 construct ( PDB ID: 1BG2, 1MKJ, which have undocked and docked neck linkers, respectively ) are superposed in C, F and I. Panels G–I show rotated views of the structures, presenting the view from the microtubule interior looking outward at the kinesin interface

. 10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 005Figure 2. Clamshell-like closure of kinesin's nucleotide cleft triggered by ATP binding on microtubules, as revealed by cryo-EM density maps of no-nucleotide kinesin ( top panels ) and the ADP•Al•Fx state ( bottom panels )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 025 Cryo-EM analysis of the ADP and ATP analog-bound states of the N255K point mutant of our construct support this hypothesis, revealing two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin in which the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile ( Figure 7C–E and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ). The corresponding 3D maps did not refine to high resolution, presumably due to mobility of the kinesin heads

Conventional kinesin is the founding member of a superfamily of molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport cargo along microtubules, serving essential roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, most notably mitosis and neuronal transport. More than 20 different members of the kinesin superfamily are identified with mitosis alone, underscoring the motor's fundamental importance in the cellular life cycle ( Rath and Kozielski, 2012 )

. Analysis of these structures leads us to infer that kinesin's switch loops, controlled by microtubules, serve as a nucleotide exchange factor while ATP binding docks the neck linker via a clamshell distortion of the active-site nucleotide cleft

. In effect, this simulation protocol is designed to reverse the isomerization induced by ATP binding in microtubule-attached kinesin, yielding a detailed prediction for the conformation of kinesin in the absence of nucleotide ( Video 2 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 012Video 2. Animation depicting our MDFF simulation for no-nucleotide kinesin, up to t = 1. 4 ns. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04686

. To address these questions, we exploited recent advances in cryo-EM methodology to obtain structure models of the kinesin motor domain complexed with microtubules in the absence of nucleotide and following binding of the non-hydrolyzable transition state analog, ADP•Al•Fx

. ( A ) Flexing of the beta sheet coupled with motion of alpha 2 in comparisons of no-nucleotide and ATP-bound conformations of microtubule-attached kinesin ( this work ). Structures are aligned by central region of the beta strand adjoining the switch II loop ( residues 226–231 ). ( B ) Comparison of no-nucleotide and ADP-bound ( 1MKJ ) structures of kinesin, aligned as in panel A

. Recently, a series of X-ray crystal structures of kinesin have been solved in the presence of ATP analogs that are thought to closely resemble kinesin's ATP state on microtubules; these include not only two structures of kinesin solved in the absence of protein co-factors ( Parke et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2013 ), but also a structure of kinesin co-complexed with a dimer of tubulin ( Gigant et al., 2013 )

., 2013 ). Thus, our maps indicate that the upper and lower domains are pinned down against the microtubule surface by a three-way interaction between the switch II loop, the switch II helix and alpha tubulin during the ATP binding transition. 10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 009Figure 3. The effect of nucleotide state and microtubule attachment on kinesin’s ‘nucleotide’ and ‘polymer’ clefts

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 015 In order to identify the basis for microtubule-affinity regulation of kinesin by ADP and vice versa, we compared our structures of microtubule-attached kinesin with two X-ray structures ( PDB ID's 1MKJ, 1BG2 ) of the same construct in an ADP-bound, weakly attaching state ( Kull et al., 1996; Sindelar et al., 2002 )

., 2013 ). However, it has remained unclear how closely these structures resemble the corresponding state of kinesin when bound to its physiological substrate ( an intact microtubule ), and structure models for other nucleotide states of microtubule-attached kinesin have remained elusive

., 2013; Kull and Endow, 2013; Arora et al., 2014 ). However, it has remained unclear how such twisting would relate to the complex interplay of affinities between kinesin and microtubules, ADP and ATP. The structure models derived in the current study indicate that in kinesin, the energy of nucleotide binding is captured by a related but distinct mode of distortion in the peptide backbone, involving coordinated rearrangements of the beta sheet and alpha 2 ( Figure 7 )

. However, closure of the switch loops ( as accompanies microtubule attachment in our structure models ) eliminates the ability of switch II to latch onto the P-loop, which would thus allow the nucleotide cleft to relax into its open conformation unless gamma phosphate is present. The preceding analysis has indicated that residue N255 in kinesin plays a key role in the motor's microtubule response pathway

. However, the side chain of N662 in the 4OZQ structure ( equivalent to N255 ) projects downward toward the microtubule surface, introducing a steric clash with alpha tubulin. 10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 016Figure 5.

., 1999 ). The neck linker connects the C-terminus of the motor domain to the stalk, which in turn is attached to the microtub. The structure of the kines-microtule complex in the presence of AD•AlFx is similar to that in the absence of nucleotide ( Figure 1B ), indicating that AD•Fx binding does not induce a significant conformational change in the kines-microtule complex. In contrast, the structure of the kines-microule in the presence of ATP is distinct from that in the absence of nucle ( Figure 1 ), indicating that ATP binding induces a conformation change in the kines-microtule. The structure of the kines-microule in the presence of ATP is similar to that in the absence of nucle ( Figure 1 ), indicating that ATP binding does not induce a significant conformation change in the kines-microule. The structure of the kines-micro in the presence of ATP is similar to that in the absence of nucle ( Figure 1 ) indicating that ATP does not induce a conformation change in kines-micro. The structure of kines in the presence of ATP is similar to that in the absence of nucle ( Figure 1 ) indicating that ATP does not induce conformation in kines-micro. The structure of kines in the presence is similar to that in absence ( Figure 1 ) that ATP does not induce conformation kines. The structure of kines in the presence is similar to absence ( Figure 1 ) that does not induce conformation kines The structure of kines in the presence is similar to absence ( Figure 1 ) that does not induce conformation kines The structure kines in the presence is similar to absence ( Figure 1 that does not induce conformation k The structure kines in the is similar absence ( Figure 1 that does not induce conformation k The kines in the is similar absence ( Figure 1 does not induce conformation k The kines in is similar ( Figure 1 does not conformation k The kines is ( Figure 1 not conformation k The k is ( 1 con k The k 1 k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k

    Title: A protein quality control pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane
    Abstract: Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins. However, quality control ( QC ) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly defined. Here, we establish temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) proteins as novel model QC substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ts- proteins sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is ubiquitinated primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation ( MAD ) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. In addition to a role for the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways.

    Supporting Text:
   . Taken together, these data establish roles for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the turnover of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts at the MOM. To date, the only ubiquitin ligases known to act on mitochondrial proteins in yeast are SCFMdm30 and Rsp5 ( Belgareh-Touzé et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al., 2006; Kowalski et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2016 ). However, the known mitochondrial substrates for these E3s are native proteins

Our knowledge of protein QC in the ER, cytosol, and nucleus derives in part from the study of proteins that undergo temperature-dependent misfolding and degradation ( Biederer et al., 1996; Gardner et al., 2005; Khosrow-Khavar et al., 2012; Ravid et al., 2006; Wang and Prelich, 2009 ). To elucidate how misfolded mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction, we exploited two previously-identified yeast ts- alleles, sam35-2 and sen2-1 ( Li et al., 2011; Milenkovic et al

., 2014 ). Generally, pathways converge post-ubiquitination, where the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex and its associated co-factors facilitate unfolding and/or extraction of substrates from their natural environments prior to targeting to 26S proteasomes for degradation ( Olszewski et al., 2019; Wolf and Stolz, 2012 ). Mitochondrial proteins are subject to ongoing oxidative insults that can result in damage, misfolding, and dysfunction

. We further assessed whether ubiquitin-modified forms of the ts- proteins were localized to mitochondria under conditions of proteasome impairment. Ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts both accumulated largely in the mitochondrial pellet fraction ( P12, 000xg; Figure 2—figure supplement 1H ) and to a lesser extent in the soluble fraction, correlating with the relative distributions of unmodified species

. Deletion of these or another proteasome shuttling factor, Ddi1, did not affect the degradation of sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ), further distinguishing MAD from ERAD. All together, these results indicate that ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates require the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex for efficient proteasomal degradation. The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex can be recruited to substrates via Cdc48’s interaction with co-factors ( Buchberger et al

. For npl4-1 and ufd1-1, however, both substrates remain primarily mitochondrial ( Figure 5B, middle and right panels ). This indicates that in the absence of a functional Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts largely retain their mitochondrial localization. The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex generally binds to ubiquitinated proteins ( Bodnar et al., 2018; Park et al., 2005; Tsuchiya et al., 2017 ), acting downstream of E3-mediated ubiquitination

., 1988; Sass et al., 2003; Young et al., 2003 ), positioning them to play a role in recognizing misfolded mitochondrial proteins and targeting them to the UPS. On the other hand, we have found that the degradation of a native MOM protein, Fzo1, largely does not require Hsp70 chaperones, extending to mitochondria a distinction between misfolded substrates and those whose ubiquitination occurs in a regulated manner

. These results establish that San1 and Ubr1 can function as components of the MAD machinery for proteasome-mediated degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts, respectively. The cytosolic SSA family of Hsp70 chaperones ( Ssa1, Ssa2, Ssa3, and Ssa4 ) is broadly involved in protein folding and refolding, but also plays a role in the degradation of several San1 and Ubr1 QC substrates ( Guerriero et al., 2013; Heck et al., 2010; Prasad et al., 2010; Stolz et al., 2013 )

. A similar fractionation pattern was observed with chromosomal HA-tagged ts- alleles ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ). Therefore, sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts are destabilized at the non-permissive temperature yet remain mitochondrially-localized, validating their use as model MAD QC substrates. Since proteasomes have broad roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and morphology, we assessed whether the degradation of these MOM ts- proteins was dependent on proteasome function

. After establishing that the stabilization of the ts- proteins in pre1-1 pre2-2 spheroplasts mirrors that observed in intact cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E ), we assessed whether sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts remain mitochondrial when proteasome function is impaired. Even after 40 min at the non-permissive temperature, the majority of both sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts accumulated in the 12, 000xg mitochondrial pellet ( Figure 2C )

. However, we found another Cdc48 complex co-factor, Ubx2, to have a substantially greater role in degradation of the two ts- substrates. Ubx2 is well-known as an ER transmembrane protein with a role in ERAD. Here, we provide strong evidence for a discrete, functional, mitochondrial pool of Ubx2. Interestingly, we find that Ubx2 also interacts with Fzo1 at mitochondria and is required for its degradation

. However, fractionation data in the proteasome mutant strain ( Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) strongly suggests that ts- protein degradation occurs from the mitochondria. Sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts also largely accumulate in the mitochondrial pellet in ubx2Δ cells ( Figure 6H ). Similar to the ts- proteins, degradation of Fzo1HA, which is a substrate for the cytosolic E3 SCFMDM30 and its cognate E2 Cdc34 ( Cohen et al

., 2019 ). With regard to ubiquitination, we find no evidence for the involvement of Rsp5 or SCFMdm30 ubiquitin ligases, which are both implicated in ubiquitination of native MOM proteins and/or maintenance of mitochondrial integrity ( Belgareh-Touzé et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2008; Escobar-Henriques et al., 2006; Fritz et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2016 ). Instead, San1 and Ubr1, which have broad roles as quality control E3s for misfolded cytosolic and nuclear proteins ( Amm et al

. Loss of other factors implicated in San1 and Ubr1 nuclear import-dependent QC, including Hsc82/Hsp82, Sti1, Hsp104, and Dsk2 were also without effect on the degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1F ). These results establish that the degradation of the mitochondrial QC substrates is dependent on both Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones, but independent of nuclear import

., 2017; Tan et al., 2018 ). The Cdc-N4pl-U1 AAA-ATase complex and its associated coactors facilitate extraction of substrates from their natural environments prior to targeting to the 26S proteasome for degradation ( Ozewski et al,2019; Wolf Stol,2012 ). Mitochondrial proteins are subject to oxidative insults that can result in damage, misfolding and dysfunction.

    Title: Intercellular propagation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation revealed by in vivo imaging of mouse skin
    Abstract: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) is a key effector of many growth signalling pathways. In this study, we visualise epidermal ERK activity in living mice using an ERK FRET biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis occasionally revealed bursts of ERK activation patterns where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of radial ERK activity distribution ( SPREAD ) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue.

   . Despite the significance of ERK activity regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue. In this study, we exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK and monitored ERK activity in epidermal cells at single cell resolution

. Our long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagate radially up to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 min until disappearance. We named this novel phenomenon as SPREAD and investigated its mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression. Although we previously reported stochastic propagation of ERK activity pulse in a single cell to its neighbouring cells ( Aoki et al

. In this study, we propose how dynamically growth signal is regulated in steady-state and wounded skin in a living tissue by showing two types of novel ERK activation patterns.

Exquisite control of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) MAPK signalling is required for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues ( Pouysségur et al., 2002; Kholodenko, 2006; Khavari and Rinn, 2007; Roberts and Der, 2007 ). ERK activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) through binding to their cognate ligands ( Yuspa, 1994; Sibilia et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2008 )

. The ERK activation pattern originated from a few cells and radially propagated mainly in the basal layer of epidermis and to a lesser extent in the suprabasal layer ( Figure 2B ). We named this focal and transient ERK activation as ‘Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution’ ( SPREAD ). It is also noteworthy that SPREADs were also observed in the epidermis of backskin, indicating that SPREADs are generally observed in mouse epidermis ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). 10

Cell proliferation at proper time and place is essential for tissue maintenance in multicellular organisms. In steady-state skin, epidermal cells undergo continuous turnover through autonomous activation of growth signal pathway triggered by the interaction of EGFRs and their cognate receptors ( Kholodenko, 2006; Khavari and Rinn, 2007 )

. To address this issue, we live imaged transgenic ( Eisuke ) mice expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) biosensor for ERK in order to visualise ERK activity in living epidermis under two photon excitation microscopy ( Kamioka et al., 2012 ). During long-time time lapse imaging of the steady-state mouse skin, we noticed the epidermis occasionally appear with bursts of ERK activation patterns, where ERK activation is propagated from cell to cell in a radial wave

. The propagation of ERK activity was achieved by cellular interaction via EGFRs and the production of their cognate ligands. Our finding of SPREAD achieved by in vivo imaging of dynamic changes in kinase activity pave a new way to understanding intrinsic relationship between cell cycle and the underlying growth signal in vivo regulated by an intercellular communications via EGFR ligands.

. Interestingly, wounded skin revealed another type of ERK activation propagation pattern, where waves of ERK activation propagated in parallel with the wound edge. Single cell analysis revealed similarity and difference between the wound-induced waves and SPREAD. While the velocity of ERK activity propagation in wound-induced waves was similar to that of SPREAD, the ERK activation waves from the wound edge was relatively maintained during propagation during propagation

. These similarities and differences between SPREADs and ERK activation waves from the wound edge suggest the possible modification of the amplitude and efficiency in propagation depending on the surrounding environment of the cells. 10. 7554/eLife. 05178. 019Figure 7. Two types of ERK activity propagation patterns during epithelial wound healing. ( A ) CFP images of the wounded ear skin of an Eisuke mouse

. Interestingly, in regions within about ca. 100 μm from the wounded edge, we found another type of ERK activation propagation pattern ( Figure 7C and Video 4 ). Here, repetitive waves of ERK activation parallel to the wound edge emerged and propagated to cells ca. 100 μm from the wound edge ( Figure 7C ). The ERK activation waves from the wound edge were suppressed by TAPI-1 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the similar mechanisms as that of SPREAD ( Video 5 )

. Together with the difference in ERK propagation manner between SPREADs in steady-state skin and ERK activation waves, this suggests that ERK propagation pattern might be altered depending on the surrounding environment of the cells, including the involvement of stem cells, cellular density, and pathological conditions. The induction of SPREADs by double TPA treatment raises the possibility that the alterations in SPREADs could be involved in tumorigenesis

. First, we observed significant increase of cell division in TPA-treated C57BL/6 mice, indicating that TPA promotes cell cycle in C57BL/6 as in FVB/N ( Figure 5 ). Second, we observed SPREADs in C57BL/6 mice as in FVB/N, although quantitative data analysis was hampered by the fluorescence from the melanin granule. In summary, here we revealed localized propagations of ERK activation regulate cell cycle progression in mouse epidermis

., 2006 ). These previous reports together with our findings show that exquisite regulation of ERK activation in terms of time, place, and degree is required for cell cycle progression and the localised transient activation of ERK in SPREAD can contribute to it. To validate the causal relationship between SPREADs and cell cycle progression, we need to develop methods to control cell cycle and/or ERK activity with the single cell resolution in the tissues

., 2013 ). Unlike the ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells, however, we could not conclude whether the inhibitors against EGFRs and MMPs suppress ERK activation in the initiator cell or abrogate intercellular propagation of the ERK activation. This is because we cannot clearly identify the ERK activation pulse at single cell resolution due partly to the long interval of image acquisition in vivo and low signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo FRET imaging

. Thus, it will be of special interest to observe SPREADs in various pathological conditions including cancer. The dependency on EGFRs and MMPs strongly suggests that a common molecular mechanism operates between SPREADs and ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells ( Aoki et al., 2013 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05178. 017 We previously showed in vitro that lateral propagation of ERK activity pulses was dependent on MMPs and EGFR activity, indicating that cleavage of pro-EGFR-ligands is critical for the signal propagation ( Aoki et al., 2013 )

. Single-cell analysis of the ERK activation waves from the wound was performed with segmentation and sine curve fittings as performed for SPREADs in Figure 3 ( Figure 8A–C ). The velocity of ERK activity propagation was determined as 1. 4 μm/min, which is similar to that in SPREAD ( Figure 8D )

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05178. 011 Previously, Albeck et al. and we reported that ERK can be spontaneously and transiently activated in culture cells and we reported that the ERK activity pulse in a single cell could be propagated to the neighbouring cells ( Albeck et al., 2013; Aoki et al., 2013 ). There are some differences between the propagation of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo, that is, SPREADs

. In contrast to ERK propagation in SPREAD, ERK activation waves from the wound edge maintained high ERK activity and propagation efficiency ( Figure 8E–F ), suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be synchronized and superimposed to generate trigger waves if a number of ERK activation pulses are evoked in close temporal and spatial proximity. The ER waves of ERK from wound were suppressed by TAPI-1 treatment ( Figure 8G ) indicating that ERK propagation is dependent on EGFR and their cognate ligands as SPs

In this study, we visualised ERK activity in living epidermis using ER FRET biosensor and observed two types of ERK activation patterns, SP and ERK waves from wound edge. SPs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression while ERK waves from wound were not. Our results provide new insights into how transient ER activity and cell cycle are synchronised in living tissue and suggest that ERK propagation can be superimposed to generate waves of ER activation.

    Title: The cyanobacterial circadian clock follows midday in vivo and in vitro
    Abstract: Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations that schedule daily changes in physiology. Outside the laboratory, circadian clocks do not generally free-run but are driven by daily cues whose timing varies with the seasons. The principles that determine how circadian clocks align to these external cycles are not well understood. Here, we report experimental platforms for driving the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in vitro. We find that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. We develop a general mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments.

    Supporting Text:
   . Thus, the entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters. This framework in turn can be used to guide the design of experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, but the model is general, so we expect it to be useful for other organisms as well.

. 51 ± 0. 11 ( sinusoidal fitting ) The fact that the core oscillator of the cyanobacterial circadian clock can be reconstituted in vitro from purified Kai proteins ( Nakajima et al., 2005; Kageyama et al., 2006 ) naturally led to the question of whether the ability to track midday in vivo is intrinsic to the core oscillator, or if it requires additional factors present in the cell

. Cyanobacteria present a unique opportunity to elucidate molecular mechanisms in circadian biology because the core oscillator responsible for driving genome-wide transcriptional rhythms can be reconstituted using purified KaiABC proteins, and these proteins have been extensively studied biochemically in constant conditions ( Nishiwaki et al., 2004; Rust et al., 2007 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 23539. 013 We biochemically simulated seasonal effects in the reconstituted KaiABC oscillator by driving the Kai proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24 hr cycle, simulating in vivo metabolic conditions during day and night. Remarkably, this in vitro system shows a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins

. The data reduction achieved in our linear model holds the promise of predicting the behavior of the circadian rhythms in many time-varying environments from a minimal data set that characterizes oscillator response, and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms. Although the biochemistry of even the simplest circadian clock is complex, our analysis suggests that a key determinant of entrained behavior is how the clock limit cycle is deformed by coupling to the environment

. To test whether this linear mathematical framework holds more generally and to understand how the cyanobacterial clock responds to a broader range of environments, we sought to measure clock response to a variety of external conditions with both single and repeated light-dark transitions. The phase oscillator model described above was inspired by the observation of linear scaling of clock phase in 24 hr days with various day lengths

. The linear approximations work because the regions where the step response functions deviate strongly from linearity are avoided in our entrainment simulations ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2C ). Together, these results indicate that the driven behavior of the cyanobacterial circadian clock in 24 hr cycles can be approximated as a simple oscillator that shifts in response to light-dark transitions with a sensitivity that varies linearly with phase

. In this context, it would be informative to analyze the geometric arrangement of day and night limit cycles of clock gene transcripts in other species. An important goal for the future is to understand how the biochemical properties of the clock components in cyanobacteria and other organisms achieve the effect of shifting the limit cycle without changing the period, allowing us to use dynamical systems theory to bridge the gap between molecular detail and systems-level clock phenotypes.

., 2015; Rémi et al., 2010 ). In this way, circadian oscillators are able to coordinate physiological events relative to specific times of day and, in multicellular organisms, specialized mechanisms exist that allow oscillators in different cells to follow distinct times of day ( Herzog, 2007; Daan et al., 2003 )

. We thus sought to extend the reconstituted system such that we could drive the biochemical oscillator with rhythmic input signals. A purified mixture of the KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins spontaneously generates a stable circadian rhythm in KaiC phosphorylation and in the formation of KaiB-KaiC complexes ( Nakajima et al., 2005; Kageyama et al., 2006 )

., 2015 ). The ability to reconstitute this effect in vitro by delivering metabolic pulses to the purified Kai proteins indicates that midday tracking is not necessarily achieved through additional feedback mechanisms in the cell, but appears to be a property of the clock proteins themselves. The purified clock responds to metabolic steps with phase shifts that are linear functions of the previous phase

. While these considerations suggest that care must be taken in connecting the in vitro and in vivo results, they also underscore the significance of our observation that the Kai oscillator proteins by themselves are sufficient to yield the linear response of the system to altered day length. We therefore sought to use this in vitro model of seasonality to uncover the biochemical basis of the linear seasonal clock response

., 2004 ). For example, the multi-feedback loop clocks in plants are able to track phases of both dawn and dusk ( Edwards et al., 2010 ). Consistent with this picture, we find that the core circadian oscillator in cyanobacteria, which relies on a single posttranslational feedback loop, keeps track of a single phase—the midpoint of the day portion of the cycle, a property described in our mathematical framework as a linear scaling of entrained phase with day length with slope m ≈ 0. 5

. Viewed in this way, the hours between dawn and dusk provide a limited window for gene expression, so that winter months at high latitude provide fewer daylight hours for this cyanobacterium to accomplish biosynthetic tasks relative to summer months. We surmised that an important function for the circadian clock in this organism might be to schedule gene expression appropriately during daylight hours, when biosynthetic resources are available

. We found that the circadian rhythm in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 ( S. elongatus ) follows a simple rule: the phase of clock-driven gene expression scales linearly with day length and remains fixed relative to the middle of the day over a wide range of day lengths. 10. 7554/eLife. 23539. 003Figure 1.

To mimic daytime in vitro, purified Kai proteins ( green, blue and red symbols ) were incubated in ‘day’ reaction buffer containing ATP. ADP was added to mimic nightfall ( [ATP]/ ( [ATP]+[ADP] ) ≈ 25% ). At simulated dawn, reactions were returned to ‘day’ buffer via buffer exchange

., 2003 ). Because the biochemical circuits governing circadian rhythms and light-dark sensing in such organisms are complex, it has been difficult to identify which features of circadian systems are responsible for seasonal adaptation. More generally, it remains unclear what features oscillators must have to respond appropriately to varying light-dark cycles and how those features are implemented molecularly in specific systems

., so that the need to carry out certain activities diurnally or nocturnally presents changing demands as the length of the day varies throughout the year. The situation is especially dramatic for cyanobacteria because there is an extreme metabolic contrast between day and night. We found that S. elongatus contends with these challenges using a clock that tracks the middle of the day

. This corresponds to a classical phase response curve ( PRC ) analysis, a commonly used tool in circadian biology for characterizing the response of a biological clock to perturbations. We also probed clock responses to dark pulses of varying lengths ( a so-called ‘wedge’ analysis ), and to repeated light-dark cycles with periods different from 24 hr

., 2004; Rust et al., 2007 ). Cyanobacteria must contend with large seasonal variations in day length because their natural aquatic environments span a wide range of latitudes ( Flombaum et al., 2013 ). Yet, comparatively little is known about how the cyanobacterial clock functions when driven by light-dark cycles that mimic days in different seasons

    Title: Loss of the transcription factor Meis1 prevents sympathetic neurons target-field innervation and increases susceptibility to sudden cardiac death
    Abstract: Although cardio-vascular incidents and sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) are among the leading causes of premature death in the general population, the origins remain unidentified in many cases. Genome-wide association studies have identified Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. We report that Meis1 inactivation in the mouse neural crest leads to an altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults characterized by a chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, thus increasing the susceptibility to SCD. We demonstrated that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1 deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. In addition, we showed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery. Accordingly, the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. These results suggest that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation.

    Supporting Text:
   . We further demonstrate that this imbalance results from neurodevelopmental defects leading to sympathetic neurons apoptosis and we position Meis1 as novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation by its role in distal target-field innervation. Among the target genes regulated by Meis1, we evidenced a transcriptional regulation of proteins necessary for retrograde transport, endosomes formation, functioning and traffic

In this work, we demonstrated that genetic inactivation of Meis1 in rodent results in an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of heart functions leading to conduction defects, chronotropic incompetence and premature SCD. In addition, we demonstrated that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation

. We aimed in our study at investigating if Meis1 participates in neural aspects of cardiac regulation by intervening in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons and how Meis1 mutations could mediate susceptibility for unexplained SCD. In this work, we highlight that loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD

. Accordingly, following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised.

. Our results further complement the study by Mahmoud et al. demonstrating Meis1 function in the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis especially following myocardial infarction ( Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). However, cardiac functions were not affected following specific Meis1 inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes ( Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). Finally, because the Meis family participates in cardiogenesis ( Stankunas et al., 2008; Mahmoud et al

. We also found that many of the Meis1 potential target genes have been documented to participate in heart functions or pathologies ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C and Figure 6—source data 2 ). Strikingly, a large number of the identified genes ( 65/309 ) were involved in vesicles formation, traffic and fusion or the regulation of exocytosis and/or endocytosis ( Figure 6—source data 3 )

. Its inactivation results in defects of distal innervation and progressive neuronal apoptosis. Identification of Meis1 effector genes revealed a large number of genes involved in endosomal and clathrin-coated cargoes formation and fusion, as well as cytoskeletal proteins participating in their anchoring and transport. Accordingly, loss of Meis1 function impairs Rab5+ endosomes formation and trafficking

. 5 PLATCRE::Meis1LoxP/LoxP embryos revealed a dramatic decrease in clathrin-positive structures in the sympathetic axons innervating the heart, as well as in the cell bodies of sympathetic neurons ( Figure 6B, C ), suggesting perturbation in the traffic of endosomal cargoes. 10. 7554/eLife. 11627. 016Figure 6. Meis1 target genes encode proteins necessary for early endosomes formation. ( A ) ISH for Syt1 on SCGs of E14. 5 and E16. 5 WT and PLATCRE::Meis1LoxP/LoxP embryos

. For instance, studies in mice and humans have revealed the implication of Sema3a-mediated sympathetic axonal guidance and patterning in the development of ventricular tachycardia and SCD ( Ieda et al., 2007; Nakano et al., 2013; Fukuda et al., 2015 ). Here, we demonstrated that Meis1 inactivation results at adult stages in a persistent and spontaneous bradycardia, blocks of conduction and severe sinus arrests independently of any cardiac malformation

. Since the function of Gdnf on survival of early SCG neurons remains unclear, and because some studies detected Gdnf mRNA in embryonic sympathetic neurons ( Trupp et al., 1995 ), a potential regulation of its expression by Meis1 could account for the increased apoptosis of this small subset of neurons. To conclude, our results show that Meis1 inactivation induces apoptosis of embryonic sympathetic neurons through different mechanisms: a severe loss of neurons occurring after E16

. In addition, preventing apoptosis of sympathetic neurons lacking Meis1 by Bax mutation did not rescue the defects in sympathetic cardiac innervation at P0 ( Figure 4D ). These results demonstrated that in the absence of Meis1, sympathetic target-field innervation, but not proximal axonal growth, is compromised. 10. 7554/eLife. 11627. 012Figure 4.

., 2010; Smith et al., 2011 ). Meis1 is a transcription factor of the TALE homeobox gene family, known to play important roles during embryonic development, cardiogenesis and postnatal cardiomyocytes turnover ( Moens and Selleri, 2006; Stankunas et al., 2008; Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). The early steps of sympathetic neurons development have been extensively documented

., 2008; Mahmoud et al., 2013 ) and has been associated with SCD by independent GWA studies ( Pfeufer et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011 ), it is tempting to speculate that Meis1 mutations in humans would result in heart dysfunctions due to cardiac malformations and/or regeneration, sympatho-vagal deregulation of cardiac rhythmicity, or a combination of dysfunctions affecting both compartments

. Altogether, these results demonstrated that in the sympathetic nervous system, part of the transcriptional program mediated by Meis1 is necessary for Rab5+ endocytic structures formation and traffic. 10. 7554/eLife. 11627. 022Figure 7.

In several neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, Meis1 expression is differentially modulated by retinoic acid ( RA ) and bFGF

. Indeed, our result are consistent with a function of Meis1 interfering with the retrograde transport of several trophic factors. In our study, we detected an increased apoptosis of Meis1 inactivated sympathetic neurons at E14. 5 that did not result in a significant variation in the volume of the SCGs, and at E16. 5 concomitantly with a significant reduction in the volume of the mutant SCGs.

Our results suggest that Me1 is involved in the regulation of sympathetic innervation of the heart by controlling the formation and traffic of Rab5+ endosomes.
Researchers investigated the morphogenesis of biofilms using Vibrio cholera as a model system. They found that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis of growing biofilms. Interfacial energy was identified as a key driving force for mechanomogenesis, dictating the generation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces. Feedback between mechanomogenesis and bio expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour. The principles discovered in bacterial biofilms, relying on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, should be applicable to morphogenesis in higher organisms. Biofilms represent a tractable model to investigate the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morph-engineering.

 Biofilms undergo morphogenic transformations from flat to wrinkled and delaminated states due to compressive stress. The authors propose a mechanomogenesis model for bio, where the mismatch between the growing biofilm and non-growing substrate causes mechanical instabilities. They inoculated V. cholera bio onto agar plates with varying agar concentrations to control substrate properties and observed changes in bio topography. Radial features reduced and amplitudes became more homogeneous with increasing agar concentration. Theoretical models describe mechanical instabilities in abiotic systems inspired a mechanom model for bio.

Biofilms harbor a growing top layer and dead layer. The mismatch causes mechanical instabilities enabling transition from flat to wrinkled and delaminated states. Quantitative imaging, biomaterial characterization, and mutant analyses supported the model. The authors suggest exploiting mechanical principles drive morphogenic events occur in bacteria and reused in eukaryotes. Biofilms could wrinkle and delaminate as growth builds compressive stress. Feedback between mechanogenesis and bio expansion shapes the bio contour. Biofilms provide a system to investigate mechanogenesis and morph-engineering.

    Title: The transcription factor NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by selective repression of a subset of target genes
    Abstract: The mechanisms generating epileptic neuronal networks following insults such as severe seizures are unknown. We have previously shown that interfering with the function of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor ( NRSF/REST ), an important transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype, attenuated development of this disorder. In this study, we found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased the low NRSF levels in mature hippocampus several fold yet surprisingly, provoked repression of only a subset ( ∼10% ) of potential NRSF target genes. Accordingly, the repressed gene-set was rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked. Unexpectedly, genes selectively repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, a property that rendered them sensitive to moderate fluctuations of NRSF levels. Genes selectively regulated by NRSF during epileptogenesis coded for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function. Thus, dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.

Of the hundreds of NRSE-containing hippocampal genes only a subset are repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy as evident from their rescue when the function of NRSF is blocked. The basis of the selective regulation of a subset of NRSE-containing genes includes their mid-range binding frequencies to NRSF, so that moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels influence the degree of their binding

. The latter set of genes was those preferentially repressed by NRSF in mature hippocampus ( Figure 4B and Figure 5C ). As shown above, only a subset of NRSE-containing genes in mature hippocampus was repressed by seizure-dependent increase of hippocampal NRSF levels and ‘rescued’ when NRSF binding was prevented. Interestingly, this sub-population of putative NRSF target genes had moderate repressor binding in the naive state which increased markedly after seizures

. NRSF-regulated hippocampal genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium-related molecules, and other transcription factors that govern neuronal function and plasticity, suggesting that their repression might contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

The key findings of these studies are: ( 1 ) NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function; ( 2 ) whereas hundreds of hippocampal genes are potential NRSF targets because they contain NRSEs, only a few dozen are actually repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy as evident from their rescue when the function of NRSF is blocked; ( 3 ) the basis of the selective regulation of a subset of

. In this study, we used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ), and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. Surprisingly, a twofold to threefold increase of NRSF levels, induced by epilepsy-provoking seizures, led to repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, and these were rescued by interfering with NRSF function

. Most were rescued by blocking NRSF function—as evident using a differential array that included control and insult groups as well as groups where NRSF function was blocked—thus ascertaining that genes that are repressed during epileptogenesis are indeed repressed by the augmented levels of endogenous NRSF. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the specificity of NRSF-mediated gene regulation in mature hippocampus in vivo

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01267. 006 To probe the basis of the differential regulation of these two gene groups, we compared the binding of NRSF to the repressed and non-repressed genes in both the naive hippocampus and following KA-seizures. Figure 5A depicts the relative binding of NRSF to 13 genes that are presented in the order of increasing NRSF binding in the naive hippocampus. Genes repressed by the seizures are shown in green

., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013 ). Here, we examined the binding of NRSF to hippocampal genes before and after an epilepsy-provoking insult and found significant increment in genes that were repressed by the factor. This suggested a correlation between repressor occupancy and gene repression ( Hammar et al., 2014 ). To our surprise, basal binding of NRSF in regulated hippocampal genes was moderate

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01267. 007 Specifically, the effects of seizure-induced increase of NRSF levels on NRSF binding to the chromatin correlated with the degree of repressor binding in the naive state: binding of NRSF to certain genes ( Ep300, Hcn2, P2xr5, Xpo6 ) was modest and did not increase significantly upon seizure-induced increase of NRSF levels ( white columns of Figure 5A–C )

. Figure 5B shows the relative binding of NRSF to the same genes in hippocampi taken from rats undergoing seizures. For each of these genes, we calculated the increment in NRSF binding after the seizures ( when NRSF levels are increased ) relative to the naive state ( Figure 5C ). As apparent in this figure, ( a ) genes repressed by seizure-induced increases of NRSF levels were those that had a large increment in NRSF binding

. 25 ). Genes that were both repressed by the seizures and ‘rescued’ by blocking NRSF–NRSE interactions encoded primarily molecules that are well-known to contribute to neuronal function and plasticity. These included ion channels and their accessory subunits, neurotransmitter receptors, genes involved in calcium-mediated cellular cascades, and phospho-enzymes ( Table 2 ). Several of these genes encode for transcription factors ( e. g

. These microarray data supported the idea that in mature hippocampus a twofold to threefold change in NRSF levels influenced the expression of only a subset of putative NRSF target genes and this repression required binding of NRSF to the chromatin. To examine the validity of the microarray data supporting this observation, we performed qPCR on a subset of genes to confirm both their seizure-induced repression as well as their ‘rescue’ by NRSE-ODN administration ( Figure 3C )

. NRSF binding was very robust at NRSE sites of other genes ( Atp2b, Crhr2, Htr1a, Pcsk1 ), and the degree of binding was relatively independent of NRSF tissue levels ( black columns of Figure 5A–C ). In contrast, seizure-induced increase of NRSF levels markedly augmented NRSF binding to genes such as Calb1, Glra2, Grin2A, Hcn1, and Kcnc2, where binding was moderate in the naive hippocampus

., 2012; Maslarova et al., 2013 ). Whereas NRSF-mediated repression might theoretically involve hundreds of hippocampal NRSE-containing genes, it was intriguing to discover that in fact only a small subset of detected NRSE-containing genes were repressed by seizures

. 3% ) contained NRSF binding sites ( Figure 2A ). The significant enrichment in the fraction of NRSE-containing genes in the repressed vs total gene population ( 8. 3% vs 2. 8% ) indicated that NRSF-regulated genes were preferentially repressed by epilepsy-provoking network hyperactivity ( Figure 2B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01267. 004Figure 2. NRSE-containing genes are enriched among hippocampal genes repressed after network activity

. In this study, we used large-scale transcriptome arrays and found that NRSE-containing genes were enriched among seizure-suppressed genes and that the majority of these genes were restored to control levels after treatment with decoy NRSE–ODNs. The fact that preventing the repression of ( ‘rescuing’ ) these genes led to attenuation of epilepsy strongly supports a role for these genes in the transformation of normal neurons ( and neuronal networks ) into epileptic ones

Their importance is supported by the fact that preventing their repression attenuated seizure-provoked neuroplasticity that promoted epilepsy ( McCloskey et al.,2013 ). The genes selectively repressed by NRS in mature hippocampus included ion channels, receptors, calcium-related molecules, and transcription factors that govern neuronal function and plasticity, suggesting that their repression might contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

    Title: Distinct lateral inhibitory circuits drive parallel processing of sensory information in the mammalian olfactory bulb
    Abstract: Splitting sensory information into parallel pathways is a common strategy in sensory systems. Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.

( a–f ) Schematics of the levels of activity in the olfactory bulb circuit consisting of M72 M/TCs ( presynaptic M/TCs ) and the recorded M/TCs ( postsynaptic M/TCs ) and the associated GCs

Parallel pathways are a common feature of many sensory systems. Yet how local circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we have identified a novel circuit mechanism for generating differential responses across two parallel pathways ( formed by MCs and TCs ) in the olfactory system and examined the emergence of feature selectivity

. How local circuits support feature selectivity in these parallel streams remains poorly understood. This issue is of particular interest when considering brain areas in which distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources, such as in the olfactory system. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, firing of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) excites two classes of projection neurons – mitral cells and tufted cells ( MCs and TCs )

. Other similarities between the olfactory and visual systems suggest that the mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared across sensory systems. In the retina, feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types ( Masland, 2012 ). Similarly, differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs, external tufted cells ( Najac et al., 2011; Gire et al

. Specifically, the combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type.

. Here we show that MCs and TCs perform odor discriminations best at separate concentration ranges and that a combination of MCs and TCs discriminates similar odors better than either population alone. These results suggests that parallel processing may offer similar benefits in other sensory systems in which stimulus intensities can vary over many orders of magnitude. For instance, rods and cones in the retina function best at different ranges of light intensity

., 2015 ). In the olfactory bulb, lateral inhibition occurs between pairs of MCs or TCs via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with inhibitory granule cells ( GCs ) ( Schoppa and Urban, 2003; Egger and Urban, 2006 ). Previously, we have shown that lateral inhibition most strongly affects MCs firing at intermediate rates because coincident input is required for the activation of GCs ( Arevian et al., 2008 )

., 2008 ). M/TCs firing at rates outside the effective range of lateral inhibition may be encoding complementary olfactory information beyond odor identity. Performing these experiments in acute slices provides the best opportunity to explore the causes and consequences of differences in lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs

. MCs. Moreover, using simulations, we show that differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition, along with other intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs, work cooperatively to enable MCs and TCs to best discriminate between similar odors in separate concentration ranges. Finally, we show that the combination of MCs and TCs facilitates odor discrimination across a wide range of odor concentrations

. Together, these simulations show that intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs work cooperatively to optimize discrimination between similar odors in separate concentration ranges. Finally, we asked more generally how sensory systems, including the olfactory system, might benefit from splitting information into multiple channels with distinct ADLI

. Finally, what are the benefits of parallel processing? In other sensory systems, different pathways may arise from functional differences at the initial stages of stimulus detection, which are then maintained through selective feedforward connectivity. In the olfactory system there is no evidence that MCs and TCs are targeted by distinct subsets of OSNs. Rather, we show that differences in bulbar circuitry are sufficient to generate important differences in response properties

Procedure used to create the odors that served as inputs to simulated mitral and tufted cell networks. ( a ) The first step in the procedure is the creation of a single odor at a set concentration using the rules outlined in a

. Our data describe local, circuit-level mechanisms that can account for several differences between MC and TC odor-evoked responses observed in vivo. Weaker lateral inhibitory currents may contribute to the finding that TCs are less frequently inhibited by odors ( Nagayama et al., 2004 )

. While understanding how animals discriminate between odors presented at a variety of concentrations is important, we confined our discriminations to odors presented at the same concentration to more closely match behavioral experiments in mice ( Abraham et al., 2010; Lepousez and Lledo, 2013 ) and to keep from making a number of assumptions about how the representation of individual odors varies with concentration

., 1983; Wellis and Scott, 1990 ). Whether these differences in odor-evoked activity in vivo reflect functional differences between GC subtypes and M/TC connectivity remains unclear, however, as: 1 ) odors activate multiple glomeruli in distinct spatiotemporal patterns, which can evoke a complex array of convergent excitation and inhibition onto individual GCs ( Burton and Urban, 2015 ), and 2 ) GC activity in vivo is strongly influenced by centrifugal input ( Balu et al

. We found that populations using subtractive or divisive inhibition performed no better than the control population across all concentrations ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2c ). These results agree with prior work that showed that ADLI substantially decorrelates MC responses to similar odors while subtractive and divisive forms of lateral inhibition have little effect on MC correlation ( Arevian et al., 2008 )

. For instance, TCs are more intrinsically excitable and receive stronger OSN-mediated excitation than MCs ( Gire et al., 2012; Burton and Urban, 2014 ). Whether other elements of the olfactory bulb circuit account for differences in MC vs. TC odor-evoked activity is unknown. Throughout the brain, lateral inhibitory circuits enhance contrast and facilitate discrimination of similar stimuli by decorrelating neural responses ( Hirsch and Gilbert, 1991; Urban, 2002; Gschwend et al

. We therefore made relatively few assumptions in performing our simulations, mostly relating to how odor concentration is encoded ( as firing rate differences [Cang and Isaacson, 2003; Fukunaga et al., 2012; Igarashi et al., 2012; Sirotin et al., 2015] – however see [Meredith, 1986] ), how lateral inhibitory connectivity is specified ( randomly ), and how MCs and TCs differ ( which was explicitly explored )

. First, we asked whether models containing a combination of MCs and TCs discriminate odors better than models that have only MCs or TCs. We used a variant of the models presented above: here, each glomerulus provided input to 2 neurons instead of 1. We compared three different output neuron configurations: 2 MCs per glomerulus, 2 TCs per glomerulus, and 1 MC and 1 TC per glomerulus ( Figure 6k, see Materials and methods )

The study investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory system of mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these types via lateral inhibitory circuits. Differences in activity-dependent inhibition between mitral and tuft cells likely reflect differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that circuit-level differences allow mitral and tuft cells to discriminate odors in separate ranges, indicating that segregating information about different stimulus intensity may be a function of parallel pathways.

Local circuits support selectivity in parallel remains poorly understood, particularly in areas with distinct outputs generated from homogeneous sources, such as the olfactory. The mammalian olfactory bulb firing olfactory neurons excites two classes of projection neurons, mitral and tuft cells. Similarities between olfactory and visual systems suggest mechanisms parallel processing may be shared.

The combination of activity-dependent inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables tuft and mitral cells to encode odors better than either population and supports computations unlikely with single neurons. The study shows mitral and tuft perform discriminations at separate ranges and combination discriminates similar odors better than either population. Results suggest parallel processing offer benefits in systems with stimulus varying intensity.

Lateral inhibition occurs between pairs of mitral tuft via dendritic synapses with inhibitory granule cells. Previously, inhibition strongly affects mitral firing at intermediate because coincident input required activation. Firing rates outside effective inhibition may encode olfactory information beyond identity. Experiments in slices explore causes and consequences differences inhibition between mitral tuft.

Simulations show differences effective range inhibition, intrinsic and circuit-level between mitral tuft work cooperatively enable to discriminate similar odors separate ranges. Combination mitral tu facilitates discrimination across wide concentrations. The study asked how sensory systems, including olfactory, benefit from splitting channels distinct AD.

    Title: Allosteric modulation in monomers and oligomers of a G protein-coupled receptor
    Abstract: The M2 muscarinic receptor is the prototypic model of allostery in GPCRs, yet the molecular and the supramolecular determinants of such effects are unknown. Monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor therefore have been compared to identify those allosteric properties that are gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

    Supporting Text:
    Allostery at the M2 muscarinic receptor generally has been understood in terms of interactions within a monomer ( Christopoulos et al., 2002 ), but that view disregards the tendency of GPCRs to form oligomers ( Park et al., 2004 ). Moreover, the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in the multiphasic effects of allosteric ligands on the dissociation rate of orthosteric antagonists and their binding at equilibrium ( Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ) ( e. g., Figure 1 )

., 1994; Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ). To understand how a multimeric complex might account for allosteric behavior that resists explanation in terms of monomers, we have compared positive and negative allosteric modulators for their effects on oligomers and purified monomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor

., 2007 ), the M2 muscarinic receptor has been a prototype for such effects within the broader family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Most studies of the interaction of an allosteric ligand with the allosteric site have been based on the modulation of events at the orthosteric site, typically on receptors in native membranes or detergent-solubilized extracts. Such events may be measured directly, as in the binding of a radiolabeled antagonist ( Christopoulos et al

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11685. 01810. 7554/eLife. 11685. 019Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Chemical structures of allosteric and orthosteric ligands to the M2 muscarinic receptor. The ligands shown are: NMS, N-methylscopolamine; QNB, quinuclidinylbenzilate; Str, strychnine; and Gal, gallamine. Different liganded states of the receptor are identified as X_R_Y, where X and Y are the allosteric and orthosteric ligands, respectively

. Allosteric effects were examined in molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level, starting from the crystal structure of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist iperoxo ( 4MQS ) ( Kruse et al., 2013 ). The ligand and accessory proteins were removed, and conformations of the receptor were sampled from a canonical ensemble accessible within a period of 30 ns

. Intermolecular interactions—i. e., between two sites on neighboring protomers of an oligomer—result in high-affinity allosteric modulation that may be positive or negative, depending upon the constraints associated with ligand-binding and the nature and extent of conformational changes transmitted between protomers. The results provide a direct demonstration of how allosteric effects characteristic of M2 receptors arise from interactions between the constituent protomers of an oligomer.

., 2013 ). Allosteric and orthosteric ligands may interact via steric hindrance, conformational changes, or electrostatic effects. In the structure computed for a monomeric M2 receptor, the interaction between gallamine or strychnine on the one hand and NMS or QNB on the other is dominated by electrostatic repulsion ( Figure 4, Table 1 )

. The allosteric site therefore is more subtype-specific than the orthosteric site, and allosteric ligands are increasingly of interest for their therapeutic potential ( Kenakin2004 ). Owing to the early demonstration of allosteric interactions in muscarinic systems ( Clark et al., 1976; Stockton et al., 1983 ) and the variety of available modulators ( May et al

. Only oligomers mimic the binding patterns observed in native membranes ( Redka et al., 2014 ). We show here that oligomers of the M2 receptor also are responsible for the high-affinity binding of allosteric ligands and for positive allosteric modulation. Whereas both effects are observed routinely with M2 receptors in natural membranes, neither is expected or observed with monomers

. The role of oligomers formed by GPCRs of Family 1A is debated, in part because oligomers are not seen to possess a unique or obligatory functionality. Both monomers and oligomers can activate G proteins, and both display allosteric communication between agonists at the receptor and guanylyl nucleotides at the G protein ( Redka et al., 2014 ). In the case of the M2 muscarinic receptor, however, the two forms mediate those effects by different mechanisms

Models of the liganded receptor were simulated by molecular dynamics as described in Materials and Methods. The region of the ligand-binding sites is shown in the figure, with NMS and strychnine ( A, C ) or with QNB and gallamine ( B, D ) at the ortho- and allosteric sites, respectively

., 2013 ). That uncertainty relates to questions regarding electrostatic repulsion between highly charged allosteric and orthosteric ligands, steric effects of the former on binding of the latter, and the effect of either ligand on conformational stability at the site of the other ( Dror et al., 2013 ). The common view that allosteric interactions occur within monomeric receptors is limited in its ability to rationalize complex effects that are seen in the binding of radioligands

. Allosteric effects that produce multiphasic binding profiles such as those illustrated by the dashed lines in Figure 1C, D have been attributed to a combination of inter- and intramolecular interactions within oligomers ( Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ). For more direct information on those interactions and related conformational changes, we developed a sensor based on FRET between FlAsH and mCherry

., 2012 ) ( e. g., Figure 1 ). Such effects appear to involve at least four allosteric sites in a mix of intra- and intermolecular heterotropic interactions within a complex of receptors that is tetrameric or larger ( Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ). We show here that all such complexity is lost when the M2 receptor is purified as a monomer ( Figure 1 )

. Our approach has involved a novel FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site, mutants that allow only for allosteric modulation between linked protomers, mechanistic modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the results indicate that intramolecular interactions—i. e., between two sites on a monomer or on the same protomer of an oligomer—are dominated by electrostatic repulsion and result in low-affinity negative modulation by the allosteric ligand

. Second, the orthosteric site was eliminated in an M2 receptor bearing mCherry at the N-terminus and FlAsH in ECL2, which together serve as a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site ( Figures 2A ). The FRET efficiency of the binding-deficient mutant was affected by NMS only when the mutant was co-expressed with the wild-type receptor ( Figure 3D ). Three lines of evidence indicate that the FRET-based sensor reports primarily on changes at the allosteric site

. Ligands therefore bind to monomers in the manner expected for a protein with one allosteric site and one orthosteric site, in contrast to the behavior of M2 receptors in myocardial membranes and unprocessed solubilized preparations. With either gallamine or strychnine, the potency defined by the single phase observed with monomers is similar to that defined by the weakest of the two or three components of the multiphasic curves observed with oligomers

. Simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble of conformations of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist ipxo 4S ( Kruse et al,201 ). The lig and accessory were removed and conformations of the receptor were sampled within a period of 30 ns. Intermolecular interactions—... between sites on neighboring protomers of an olig—result in high-affinity alloic that may be positive or negative depending on the associated ligand and nature and conformation changes transmitted between prot. The results demonstrate how alloic effects of M receptors arise from interactions between the protomers of an olig

The results show that oligomers of the M receptor are responsible for high-affinity binding alloic ligands and positive alloic modulation. Both effects are observed routinely with M receptors in membranes but not with monomers. The role of oligomers by GPC Family 1 is debated, in part because oligomers do not possess unique or obligatory functionality. Both monomers and olig can activate proteins and display alloic between agonists at the receptor and guanyl nucleotides at the protein. In the case of M musinic receptor however, the forms mediate effects by different mechanisms.

    Title: SETD2 is required for DNA double-strand break repair and activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint
    Abstract: Histone modifications establish the chromatin states that coordinate the DNA damage response. In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 ( H3K36me3 ), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.

    Supporting Text:
   . We demonstrate using powerful reporter assays that SETD2 is necessary for the DDR and that depletion of SETD2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. Our data further reveal that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5′ ends and SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs. SETD2 mutations were recently found in several cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) ( Dalgliesh et al

. Hence, additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR. Unlike all histone modifications found to promote the DDR, previous studies ( Pei et al., 2011 ) and our data show no evidence of increased H3K36me3 levels at the DNA damage sites or of a DDR-dependent recruitment of SETD2 to DSBs. These findings disclose an unprecedented role for a histone-modifying enzyme in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage

. CcRCC is an example of a cancer, where a high rate of genomic alterations occurs in parallel to inactivating mutations and deletions of histone modifiers, such as SETD2 ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013; Sato et al., 2013 ). The present study provides a functional link between these two events extending our understanding of the impact of altered chromatin states on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity

., 2013 ). Nevertheless, whether SETD2 impinges on the cell's ability to cope with DNA DSBs is not yet known. In this study, we investigate the role of SETD2 on the cellular response to DNA DSBs. Our findings identify a novel role of this histone methyltransferase in rendering cells competent to repair DSBs

In this study, by focusing on the pathways that repair DSBs upon RNAi depletion of SETD2, we reveal that this histone methyltransferase is necessary for the DDR. We show that SETD2 is required for the activation of ATM following DNA damage. In agreement with the impaired ATM activation, spreading of γH2AX and 53BP1 phosphorylation was greatly compromised in SETD2-depleted cells treated with NCS or etoposide, but only marginally affected in DSBs induced by phleomycin

. Depletion of SETD2 abrogates p53 activation, and leads to eviction of the G1/S checkpoint upon DNA damage. In addition to the defects in the DNA damage signaling that we found in SETD2-depleted cells, which could extend to improper p53 activation, it is also possible that SETD2 impinges directly on p53 activity and activation of its downstream targets through direct protein–protein interactions ( Xie et al., 2008 )

. The binding of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin tilts the balance between the DNA repair pathways towards NHEJ by preventing 5′ end resection of the broken DNA ends ( Bouwman et al., 2010; Bunting et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2012 ). We therefore investigated whether SETD2 depletion favors DNA 5′ end resection and repair of DSBs by HR. To this end, we quantified the DNA in the vicinity of a DSB created by the I-SceI nuclease using the DR-GFP reporter assay ( Pierce et al

. This suggests that H3K36me3 decorates at least a fraction of the nucleosomes to which 53BP1 binds. Altogether, these findings further support the view that H3K36me3 contributes to the establishment of the chromatin state that coordinates the recruitment and activation of DDR factors, even though SETD2 is not actively recruited to DNA damage sites

. From all cancers on which SETD2 mutations have been reported, ccRCC shows the highest mutation rate ( Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Varela et al., 2011 ). Our present findings reveal that SETD2 mutant ccRCC cells have impaired DDR signaling which leads to inefficient repair of DNA damage. However, the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint is not activated in SETD2-deficient cells despite the persistence of DNA damage

. Although it is now evident that alterations in histone modifications are a hallmark of most cancers, it is still unclear whether these changes are drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis ( Waldmann and Schneider, 2013 ). Our findings endorse the classification of SETD2 as a tumor suppressor and place inactivating mutations in this histone modifier at the peak of a harmful cascade of events that may ultimately drive malignant cell transformation and tumor development.

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02482. 008 A high frequency of SETD2 mutations was recently disclosed in several cancers, of which clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) shows the highest SETD2 mutation rate ( Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Varela et al., 2011 ). Our present findings suggest that impaired DDR proficiency constitutes a hallmark of SETD2 mutant cancers and could reveal a novel mechanism through which SETD2 suppresses tumor development and growth

., 2011 ). In addition to γH2AX, other histone modifications have been shown to play key roles during the DDR, illustrating the importance of a thorough characterization of the chromatin landscape of a DNA lesion. We have recently shown that the histone methyltransferase SETD2 ( also termed KMT3 or HYPB ), which is responsible for all H3K36 trimethylation, but not H3K36 mono- or dimethylation ( Edmunds et al

. 3 at DSBs and facilitates RAD51 recruitment and efficient HR repair. Nevertheless, the major impact of SETD2 on RNA polymerase II transcription and pre-mRNA processing that others and we have previously described ( reviewed in de Almeida and Carmo-Fonseca, 2014 ) discloses the alternative possibility that the impaired formation of RAD51 filaments and HR may result from disrupted gene expression of key DNA repair factors

. In fact, most H3K36me3 is found at actively transcribed chromatin where it signals the recruitment of the histone chaperone FACT to reassemble nucleosomes in the wake of RNA polymerase II elongation ( Carvalho et al., 2013 ). Should a DSB amputate a coding region, exposure of H3K36me3 previously deposited by SETD2 traveling with the transcriptional machinery may promote DNA repair by HR and would guarantee the integrity of the genetic information

. Herein, we further investigated whether the role of SETD2 in the DDR extends to the regulation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. We show that ccRCC cells carrying inactivating mutations on SETD2 phenocopy the impaired DDR observed in SETD2 RNAi-depleted human cells. Importantly, SETD2 inactivation severed the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint despite the persistence of unrepaired DNA lesions in ccRCC cells

DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are the most catastrophic form of DNA damage and pose great threat to genome stability. The major sensor of DSBs is ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) kinase, which is critical for the initial steps of the DNA damage response ( DDR ). In response to DSBs, ATM phosphorylates and regulates the activity of several substrates involved in DNA repair, such as p53-binding protein 1 ( 53BP1 ) and histone H2AX ( Matsuoka et al., 2007 )

. These findings reveal that the impaired DDR observed in SETD2 mutant cells translates into a massive failure to repair DSBs, which is likely to impact severely on genomic stability and may sustain the tumorigenic phenotype. 10. 7554/eLife. 02482. 010Figure 7. Repair of double-strand breaks is compromised in SETD2 mutant ccRCC cells

. In DSBs induced by phleomycin, depletion of SETD2 impairs the recruitment of 53BP to DSB sites and the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, leading to reduced homologous recombination (HR) repair. In contrast, SET2 mutant ccR cells show persistent DNA lesions but fail to activate the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint. This suggests that loss of SET2 provides an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the p53 checkpoint without the need for additional mutations in TP53

The authors of this study investigated the role of the histone methyltransferase SET2 in the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. They found that SET2 is required for the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which is a key sensor of DSBs, and for the recruitment of 53-binding protein 1 (53BP) to DSB sites. They also found that SET2 is necessary for the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, which are involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DSBs. In contrast, SET2-deficient cells showed impaired DNA signaling and failed to activate the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint, despite the presence of unrepaired DNA lesions. The study suggests that SET2 is a tumor suppressor and that inactivating mutations in this histone modifier may contribute to tumorigenesis.

    Title: Rasgrp1 mutation increases naïve T-cell CD44 expression and drives mTOR-dependent accumulation of Helios+ T cells and autoantibodies
    Abstract: Missense variants are a major source of human genetic variation. Here we analyze a new mouse missense variant, Rasgrp1Anaef, with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rasgrp1Anaef mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and gradually accumulate a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Rasgrp1Anaef is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells. CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation.

   . Rasgrp1Anaef is distinct from previously described autoimmune mutations in Rasgrp1, Zap70 or Lat, as Rasgrp1Anaef has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal TCR repertoires, but results in peripheral accumulation of a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ T-helper cells and production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. In contrast to Rasgrp1 deletion, the Rasgrp1Anaef missense variant increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells

The findings here reveal a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells. By analyzing a missense mutation in the Rasgrp1 EF-hand, the results dissociate this new function of Rasgrp1 from its well-known role in thymic positive selection

. By a combination of biochemical and genetic studies, we identify overactive mTOR signaling within naïve CD4 T cells as a key component for Rasgrp1Anaef to drive two abnormalities: ( 1 ) a constitutive increase in CD44 expression in naïve CD4 T cells and ( 2 ) a gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios+ CD44hi CD4 cells and autoantibodies. Rasgrp1Anaef’s effect on Ras/ERK signaling in vivo was much milder than expected from its effects in in vitro assays

. Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice.

. While the Anaef EF-hand mutation did decrease Rasgrp1 activation of Ras and ERK when thymocytes were stimulated acutely by antibodies to CD3 or with PMA in vitro, the activity of this pathway during physiological positive selection in vivo remained sufficient for normal numbers of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells to form even under competitive reconstitution conditions

. By contrast, in vivo, Rasgrp1Anaef did not alter CD69 and TCRβ induction or positive selection of thymocytes, unlike the C-terminally deleted ( Rasgrp1d/d ) and knockout ( Rasgrp1−/− ) alleles which caused moderate and severe decreases in these processes, respectively. This may indicate that the cumulative Ras-ERK signals required for these events are sufficiently buffered or robust that they tolerate a modest reduction in Rasgrp1’s Ras activating activity

. Thymocyte subset-specific P-ERK analyses revealed reduced anti-CD3- and PMA-induced responses in DP, CD4SP, and CD8SP Rasgrp1Anaef thymocytes ( Figure 5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ), echoing the cell line conclusion that the Anaef mutation results in a partial loss of function with respect to induced Ras-ERK signaling

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01020. 007 Despite the normal thymic development in Rasgrp1Anaef animals, there was a striking biochemical effect of the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation on activation of the canonical Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK signaling pathway in a range of in vitro stimulation assays.

    Title: Arid1a restrains Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity
    Abstract: Mutations in members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common events in cancer, but the mechanisms whereby disruption of SWI/SNF components alters tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. To model the effect of loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1a in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) initiation, we directed shRNA triggered, inducible and reversible suppression of Arid1a to the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic KrasG12D. Arid1a cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas as postnatal silencing of Arid1a following sustained KrasG12D expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. Together, our results demonstrate Arid1a as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity, and underscore an unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . Suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous, pancreatic cancer precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. Thus, our data suggest that Arid1a can provide a potent barrier to Kras driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and, consequently, early stage pancreatic neoplasia

. Alcian blue staining further confirmed the retention of mucinous lesions in Arid1a-restored mice ( Figure 5E ). Thus, Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context. We next sought to understand the mechanism ( s ) whereby Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. Perturbation of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is expected to impact the expression of SWI/SNF target genes ( Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015 )

. These features imply that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar to duct like trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras, a critical rate-limiting step in Kras driven pancreatic neoplasia. Indeed, our transcriptional and chromatin profiling data imply that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key TFs to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate

., 2003 ). Thus, while the ability of Arid1a to stabilize acinar cell identity may act as a barrier to pancreatic cancer initiation, other factors are likely necessary to promote the PanIN-to-PDAC transition. Collectively, our data suggest that acute loss of Arid1a in the setting of a pre-existing Kras mutation rapidly perturbs the identity and function of pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing their sensitivity to metaplastic and PanIN-inducing signals stemming from oncogenic Kras

. Addressing these issues, we implement a powerful mouse-modeling platform that enables inducible and reversible disruption of gene function to show that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic Kras

We sought to create a model with the capability for inducible and reversible Arid1a knockdown at different stages of PDAC progression. To this end, we used a previously developed mouse model of KrasG12D-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis that integrates robust and inducible RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology with embryonic stem ( ES ) cell genetic engineering ( Saborowski et al., 2014 )

. Furthermore, it is not known whether the disruption of SWI/SNF activity that accompanies tumorigenesis is needed to sustain neoplastic disease. We set out to develop an in vivo model to address the role of the SWI/SNF component ARID1A in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ), a setting in which mutations in ARID1A or other SWI/SNF components occur in up to 25% of cancer patients ( Shain et al., 2012 )

. In order to dissect the role of Arid1a in pancreatic tumorigenesis and tissue homeostasis using the above system, we first generated GFP-coupled shRNAs capable of almost complete silencing Arid1a from a single genomic copy ( Figure 1B ) and subsequently cloned two into the Col1A1 targeting cassette downstream of a tetracycline-response element ( TRE ) driven promoter; this configuration enables inducible and reversible expression of a downstream transgene in cells expressing the rtTA and

Mutations in chromatin remodelers are prevalent across the human cancer spectrum, making identification of tissue specific relationships between chromatin regulation and tumorigenesis an important goal in understanding neoplastic progression. In this study, we used a rapid and robust mouse-modeling platform to study the consequences of inducible and reversible suppression of the Arid1a SWI/SNF subunit in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer

. Thus, Arid1a suppression accelerates the transition from an acinar to a mucinous cell fate in the presence of a pre-existing oncogenic Kras mutation ( adult and P5 cohorts ) whereas, when occurring concomitant with KrasG12D activation, it paradoxically promotes retention of the acinar cell phenotype ( E7 cohort ). Taken together, these data reveal a temporal, context-dependent role for Arid1a in regulating acinar identity in response to oncogenic Kras

. Unlike our Arid1a suppression strategy, mouse models using conditional alleles necessarily disrupt SWI/SNF concomitantly with Kras activation. Indeed, when we recapitulate such timing during embryonic development, we see a lower level of PanIN formation with shArid1a pancreata showing the retention of acinar cells, that contrasts with the effects of sequential suppression of Arid1a in acinar cells harboring pre-existing expression of mutant Kras

. Apparently, Arid1a suppression sensitizes pancreatic epithelial cells to mucinous reprogramming by oncogenic Kras or, alternatively, increases the efficiency of Kras-induced acinar-to-ADM-to-PanIN transitions. Regardless, this Kras-dependence differs from the phenotype produced by deletion of acinar TFs such as Ptf1a or Nr5a2, whose loss generally perturbs acinar maintenance and/or regeneration ( Cobo et al., 2018; Flandez et al., 2014a; Krah et al., 2015; von Figura et al

. The accelerated PanIN formation produced by Arid1a suppression required the presence of a Kras mutation, the initiating event in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Thus, Arid1a suppression in the normal pancreas did not appreciably perturb acinar differentiation, even during wound healing responses that force a reversible acinar to ductal metaplasia

., 2016 ). Thus, we next sought to determine whether the ability of Arid1a suppression to accelerate Kras driven preneoplastic changes in the pancreas reflects a general requirement for Arid1a function to sustain acinar homeostasis even in the absence of oncogenic signaling. To this end, we eliminated the LSL-KrasG12D allele from ES cell-derived KC-RIK-shArid1a and KC-RIK-shRen mice though one round of breeding

. This supports a model where initiating oncogenic KRAS mutations trigger ADM and PanIN conversion at low efficiency; mutation of ARID1A may boost the frequency of this process by increasing cellular plasticity. Other tumor suppressor mutations ( such as TP53 and CDKN2A ) that co-occur with KRAS and ARID1A can then contribute to further PanIN progression

. This enabled us to suppress Arid1a in the presence of existing oncogenic Kras ( Bailey et al., 2016 ) but after completion of pancreas development ( Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B ), mimicking somatic alteration of the SWI/SNF complex and the order of mutational events known to occur in the human disease ( Waddell et al., 2015 ). KC-RIK-shRen mice were used as controls

., 2016; Hemann et al., 2003; Premsrirut et al., 2011 ) yet, by leaving the target locus intact, enables the endogenous protein to be re-expressed upon shRNA silencing. Here, shRNA mediated knockdown of Arid1a produced a shift in acinar to mucinous cell fate and a PanIN histopathology that was not reversed by subsequent Arid1a re-expression

., 2014 ). Consistent with coupling of the Arid1a shRNA expression to a GFP reporter, we observed efficient knockdown of Arid1a in the GFP-expressing epithelial cells of the pancreas and not in the GFP-expressing mesenchymal cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ), indicating specificity of the shRNA to epithelial cells

Our results suggest that Ar1 is a critical regulator of acinar cell identity in response to oncogenic Kras, and that timing of Ar1 inactivation influences the outcome of SW/S complex alterations in epithelial tumenesis.

    Title: Sexually dimorphic neuronal responses to social isolation
    Abstract: Many species use social networks to buffer the effects of stress. The mere absence of a social network, however, may also be stressful. We examined neuroendocrine, PVN CRH neurons and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for <24 hr increased first spike latency ( FSL ) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. These changes were not evident in age-matched males. By contrast, subjecting either males ( isolated or grouped ) or group housed females to acute physical stress ( swim ), increased FSL. The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

    Our findings demonstrate that brief social isolation ( <24 hr ) affects the biophysical properties of PVN CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion. We report an increase in FSL and a decrease in neuronal excitability in socially-isolated female, but not in age-matched, male mice. By contrast, an acute physical stress ( swim ) increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males. In addition, social isolation occluded the effects of swim stress on female mice

. We then prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN in acute brain slices ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b ) ( Figure 1a ). Activation of these cells is obligatory for launching the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Denver, 2009 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 18726. 003Figure 1. Social isolation alters intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, not male mice

. Next, we hypothesized that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a stress. If true, we reasoned that subjecting single-housed male mice to an acute swim stress should also increase FSL. In females, however, the prior isolation should occlude the effects of an acute stress. To test this idea, single -housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20 min and intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed ( Figure 2a )

., 2013b ). These findings demonstrate that males and females react differently to some stressors but not others. Specifically, social isolation has definitive, CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in female, but not male mice. By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress

. e. forced swim ). Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males. 10. 7554/eLife. 18726. 007Figure 2. Females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physical stress. ( a ) Experimental timeline. ( b ) Neuronal responses to +80 pA depolarizing pulse in single-housed males and females

. CORT is both necessary for the isolation ( females ) and swim stress ( males and females ) induced increases in FSL and sufficient to increase FSL in the absence of stress. Finally, we noted the effect of social isolation was graded in female mice with paired mice exhibiting FSLs that were intermediate to those observed from group-housed or single mice

. 7 ± 1. 9 ms, n = 27, p>0. 05 vs malegroup, Figure 2d ). Similarly, CRH neurons in group-housed females subjected to swim had a significantly longer FSL than CRH neurons in naive, group-housed females ( p=0. 0001 ). These observations demonstrate that both females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physical stress ( i. e. forced swim )

. 86; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We also examined properties of glutamate and GABA synapses on CRH neurons in hypothalamic slices from single-housed females and males. We observed no differences in basal glutamate ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) or GABA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) synaptic transmission. These observations indicate that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, but not age-matched male mice

. We did, however, observe an increase in the decay time constant of rapidly inactivating K currents in socially-isolated female mice compared to male mice, providing a potential underlying mechanism for the prolonged FSL in response to depolarization. The longer FSL we observed is not a classically defined characteristic of CRH neurons and, in fact, the absence of this delay has been used previously to categorize putative CRH neurons ( Hoffman et al., 1991; Wamsteeker Cusulin et al

. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both the sex of the animal and the stressor modality when designing studies investigating neurobiological effects of stress. Indeed recent work demonstrating sex-specific expression of fear responses in rodents ( Gruene et al., 2015 ) serves as a corollary to our observations and when taken together suggests that strategies for coping with stress are sex-specific

Survival threats trigger a repertoire of behavioral and endocrine adjustments ( Cannon, 1932 ). The endocrine changes rely on the immediate engagement of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis which is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVN ). Although it is essential for survival, the dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases ( Tost et al

., 2000 ). Here we hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice.

. In particular, our findings highlight the importance of a social network in females and provides a neurobiological framework for further testing the underlying thesis of ‘tend and befriend’ strategy for females in response to stress ( Taylor et al., 2000 )

., 2000 ). Finally, as our observations report sex-specific differences in response to stress in the first two weeks post-weaning, they provide clear evidence for biological effects on the stress axis that are independent of circulating gonadal hormones ( McCarthy and Arnold, 2011 ). This exquisite sensitivity of the brain during the pre-adolescent period ( Foilb et al

., 2015 ). Interestingly, many of these psychopathologies show sex-specific differences which may be a consequence of sexual dimorphism of the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Bale and Epperson, 2015 ). This sexual dimorphism may result in different response sensitivity to the same stressor and/or differences in which stimuli males and females perceive as stressful

Collectively, these observations demonstrate that CORT is both necessary ( during stress ) and sufficient ( in the absence of stress ) to increase FSL in male and female mice. 10. 7554/eLife. 18726. 008Figure 3.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18726. 010 Next, we asked whether these differences in FSL were due to changes in the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons. We prepared hypothalamic brain slices from singleoused and group-housed mice and examined intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in acute slices ( Wste Culin et al.,2013b ) ( Figure 1 ). Activation of these cells is obligatory for the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Denver,2009 ) 10.755/e.187.26 003 Figure 1. Social alters intrinsic of CRH in female, not male mice

We hypothesized that female, but not male, mice may interpret social isolation as stress. If true, we reasoned that subjecting singleoused males to acute stress should increase F. In females, however, prior isolation should occlude the effects of acute stress. To test this, singleoused and females were subjected to stress for 20 min and intrinsic of CR neurons assessed ( Figure 2 ). 201b. These demonstrate that males and females react differently to stressors not. Specifically, social has CORT-dependent effects on CRH in female, but male mice By contrast, both males females show indistinguishable responses to acute stress ( swim ). forced ) Additionally, prior isolation occludes the effects of subsequent stress on F in females but has no effect on F in males.10.755/e.187.26 007 Figure 2 Females and males equivalent to acute stress ( a Experimental timeline b Neuronal to + pA depolarizing in single males and females

    Title: Evolutionary and functional insights into the mechanism underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian hemoglobin
    Abstract: Hemoglobin ( Hb ) represents a model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Although both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery, only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb. Here, we suggest that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery. To test this hypothesis, we derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation. We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The generality and implications of our findings are discussed.

   ., 2017 ). Evolutionary tuning of mammalian Hb maximum cooperativity and affinity points, achieved by co-varying the relative affinity and conformational ratio of its quaternary states, thus regulates tissue oxygen delivery by Hb and serves as one mean to meet the distinct needs of different animal tissues for oxygen ( Figures 4 and 5 )

. The fact that different mammalian Hbs exhibit different maximum nH values ( Figure 2a ), combined with the observation made above whereby systematically higher maximum Hill value gives rise to higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by MWC proteins ( Figure 4c ), led us to hypothesize that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply

. Likewise, Hb in small-sized animals that display high metabolic rates presents lower affinity for oxygen than does the same protein in large-sized animals, again reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 )

., 2007 ). Nevertheless, even with such limitations, the results derived from the evolutionary dataset support the hypothesis that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution, giving rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding, albeit yielding a different maximum nH value in each case. To further examine whether this indeed is the case, we considered the human Hb physiological dataset

. Specifically, the greater an animal’s metabolic rate, the higher was the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb. Furthermore, as previously shown ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ), an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity

. Here, we tested whether the values of both p50 and nH of Hb are indeed optimized in the case of body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb, relying on extensive evolutionary and physiological oxygen saturation datasets available for mammalian Hb proteins. The former comprises a set of oxygen binding curves of homologous Hb proteins from different mammalian species, all measured under similar physiological conditions ( Milo et al., 2007; Rapp and Yifrach, 2017 )

. The mapping of experimentally derived Hill and MWC parameters of all evolutionary and physiological dataset curves on this landscape provided insight into the mechanism underlying the adaptive behavior of p50 and nH with respect to tissue oxygen delivery by mammalian Hb and their relation to organism fitness

. Finally, the co-varied c and L values underlying maximum cooperativity allow for control of the broadness of the ‘buffering of cooperativity’ regime ( Figure 4d, f ). Taken together, these points support the assertion that mammalian Hb nH and p50 values reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that serve to optimize the tradeoff between O2 loading in pulmonary capillaries and O2 unloading in tissue capillaries, so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery

. Over the years, many studies have indicated that Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) is an adaptive trait, that is its value has been tuned during evolution so as to tailor tissue oxygen delivery to the particular metabolic requirements of vertebrates due to variations in body size, lifestyle and/or environmental conditions

. Third, parameter adjustments that lead to higher maximum nH values also give rise to reduced Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) ( Figures 4b and 5b ), thus reinforcing oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues. Indeed, the affinity-cooperativity tradeoff typical of the ridge of maximum cooperativity suggests that cooperativity can compensate for changes in affinity, with respect to tissue oxygen unloading, as usually described in any Biochemistry textbook

. The observed variations in maximum cooperativity Hill values among mammalian Hb proteins thus reflect co-evolution of binding and conformational changes of Hb. Such tuning gives rise to a buffering of cooperativity effect, suggesting that the degree of cooperativity is robust to changes in physiological conditions brought about by tuning L alone ( Figure 3 ). Our results thus reveal the evolutionary strategy underlying the observed variations in Hb behavior

. Based on experimental ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and theoretical ( Figure 4 ) results, we suggest that evolutionary ( i. e., across species ) variations allow for gross changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity. Such changes are controlled by the maximum cooperativity and affinity values of Hb, in turn determined by changes in both L and c ( Figure 4c, filled symbols )

. Accordingly, early respiratory system physiologists assigned great significance to the p50 parameter, terming it ‘oxygen unloading tension’, and proposed that Hb function could be explained in terms of adaptive evolution of this value ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ). At the same time, such studies ignored the adaptive potential of cooperativity ( nH ) with respect to Hb function. This is surprising, given that nH also affects Hb tissue oxygen delivery

. Instead, Hb oxygen binding generally involves intermediate ligation and conformational species, as delineated by the MWC allosteric model ( Marzen et al., 2013; Monod et al., 1965; Rubin and Changeux, 1966 ) ( Figure 1b ) ( see Appendix 1 for a detailed discussion on why we think the classical MWC allosteric model adequately describes hemoglobin oxygen ligation in the presence or absence of its allosteric ligands; see also Henry et al., 1997; Milo et al

., 2008; Storz et al., 2009 ). Hb represents an excellent model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates ( Perutz, 1983; Poyart et al., 1992; Hourdez and Weber, 2005; Storz and Moriyama, 2008 ). Hb is a tetrameric allosteric protein responsible for tissue oxygen delivery in a manner controlled by the midpoint and slope of its oxygen saturation curve

. The Hb physiological dataset comprises 26 different human Hb saturation curves collected under a variety of different physiological conditions, including those involving changes in H+ ( Di Cera et al., 1988; Imai, 1983 ), CO2 ( Doyle et al., 1987 ) and 2, 3-BPG ( bis-phosphoglycerate ) ( Benesch et al., 1971 ) concentrations. For each dataset curve, the magnitude of cooperativity in oxygen binding was evaluated using either the Hill ( Figure 1a ) or MWC model ( Figure 1b )

. Given the inherent tradeoff between arterial O2 loading and peripheral O2 unloading, it is not clear whether improved tissue oxygen delivery is achieved by increased oxygen affinity to improve Hb loading or by decreased affinity to favor unloading ( Storz, 2016 ). Either very high or very low oxygen affinity would result in a low fraction of tissue oxygen delivery unless cooperativity ( nH ) between Hb subunits is introduced as a means to switch between low- and high-affinity Hb states

The evolutionary and physiological datasets for Hb used in the current study were respectively compiled in the meta-analysis of Hb function by Milo et al. ( 2007 ) and by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ). Specifically, the Hb evolutionary dataset comprises 14 different mammalian Hb oxygen saturation curves obtained under similar physiological conditions ( Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1 )

The functional data analyzed here considered the evolutionary and physiology Hb datasets respectively complied in Milo et al. ( 2007 ) and Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ). The evolutionary dataset comprised oxygen saturation curves of Hb from 14 different mammal samples obtained under similar physiological conditions

. The functional advantages of the balance between the relative affinity and conformational ratio of Hb quaternary states underlying the maximum Hill point become clear when considering that both the affinity and cooperativity parameters of Hb saturation curves affect tissue oxygen unloading. First, the c-L tradeoff gives rise to the highest possible Hill value for any given c value, thereby ensuring maximal oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues ( Figure 3 ). Second, the relationship between the Hill coefficient and conformation parameters of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model graph the ‘biophysical landscape’ describing this relation ( Figure 4 ) shows that mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity that allows for both gross and fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet the distinct requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen

The findings of this study reveal the mechanism underlying body-related adaptation of mammalian H. The generality and implications of our findings are discussed below

The Hill coefficient and cooperativity of oxygen binding to H affect tissue oxygen delivery, but only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of H.

    Title: Longitudinal analysis of Plasmodium sporozoite motility in the dermis reveals component of blood vessel recognition
    Abstract: Malaria infection starts with injection of Plasmodium sporozoites by an Anopheles mosquito into the skin of the mammalian host. How sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, but poorly understood process. In this study, we examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels, using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they exhibit ‘avascular motility’, defined by high speed and less confinement, while in the vicinity of blood vessels their motility is more constrained. We find that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site.

    Supporting Text:
   . 5 μm/s in vitro ( Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). Here, we present a quantitative in vivo study on the motility of Plasmodium sporozoites over time, and by visualization of dermal vascular endothelia we describe their interaction with dermal blood vessels. We characterize changes in sporozoite motility over the first 2 hr after intradermal inoculation and identify an altered type of sporozoite motility in proximity of blood vessels

. We rendered the CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites fluorescent in order to study the function of these surface proteins in dermal parasite motility and blood vessel recognition and found that CSΔN sporozoites spend more time engaging with blood vessels, yet are unable to enter the blood circulation. Imaging TRAP-VAL sporozoites, we find that their slow gliding speed significantly decreases the volume of tissue explored, which likely results in reduced ability to encounter blood vessels.

The gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity. Previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis ( Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011 ), but an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 min after inoculation highlights significant changes in their motility in this time frame

. These data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite and suggest that sporozoites in the dermis exhibit two types of motility: ‘avascular motility’, which is defined by high speed and less confinement, leading to maximal displacements in avascular areas and a more constrained ‘perivascular motility’, which is observed once the parasite glides in proximity of a blood vessel

. With this study, we refine our understanding on how the sporozoite navigates through and out of the dermis. Mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. These data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene

. Our analysis of track curvature reveals that sporozoites gliding in the proximity of blood vessels describe trajectories with local curvatures that interestingly relate to the curvature of the capillary vessel ( Yen and Braverman, 1976; Braverman, 1997 ). This suggests that ‘perivascular motility’ enhances contact with capillaries, rather than the larger dermal terminal arterioles or post-capillary venules ( Yen and Braverman, 1976; Braverman, 1997 )

. We observed sporozoites gliding in close proximity to CD31-labeled vessels and frequently found sporozoites gliding in parallel to or in circular paths around the vessel ( Figure 2A and Video 2 ). Surprisingly, sporozoites do not immediately penetrate blood vessels after contacting them. Instead, they move on and around vessels for significant periods of time, frequently even detaching from vessels and moving back into avascular areas of the tissue ( Figure 2A and Video 2 )

. This points to a specific host–parasite interaction between the parasite and the environment of the blood vessel and provides evidence for the ability of the sporozoite to alter motility in response to host factors. Indeed, in vitro, sporozoites have been shown to respond to obstacle cues in micro-fabricated arrays so it is possible that environmental constraints alone account for the switch in the sporozoites' migration pattern ( Hellmann et al., 2011 )

. We quantified the time sporozoites spend in proximity to blood vessels and found that on average, sporozoites spend 28% of their gliding time near or on vessels, which in our 4-min videos correspond to over a minute of total gliding time. 10. 7554/eLife. 07789. 008Figure 2. Sporozoites recognize dermal blood vessels. Time-lapse microscopy of sporozoites, 10 min after intradermal inoculation, and CD31-labeled vascular endothelia

. This suggests that only certain areas of the vasculature are suitable for sporozoite entry. It is known that the abluminal surface of dermal capillaries is not uniform; for example, the basement membrane surrounding the capillary bed is not continuous and through its gaps, pericytes form tight junctions with the underlying endothelial cell ( Braverman, 1997 ). Thus, there may be certain areas of the vasculature that are preferentially invaded by sporozoites

., 2006 ). Intravital imaging of mutant sporozoites that do not efficiently exit the dermis provides additional insights into the factors required for dermal exit. The importance of high sporozoite gliding speed is highlighted by the behavior of the TRAP-VAL mutant that moves with less than half the motile speed of wild-type control parasites in the dermis. This decrease in speed corresponds to the reduction of final MSD, which reduces the area of tissue explored by 70%

., 2011; Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). We characterized the motility of CSΔN and TRAP-VAL sporozoites in the dermis to elucidate the function of these surface proteins in vivo, specifically focusing on parasite motility and blood vessel entry. Both mutants were generated in a drug selection cassette-free parental P. berghei parasite line expressing mCherry under the control of a strong sporozoite-stage promoter ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3; Figure 3—figure supplements 1, 2 )

. Indeed, it has been observed previously, that the curvature of the sporozoite matches the geometry of capillaries ( Vanderberg, 1974 ) and more recently, a study using stochastic computer simulations of sporozoite motility found that in these models, sporozoite interaction with capillaries is greatly enhanced if the parasite has the ability to adapt its curvature and torsion to the surrounding environment ( Battista et al., 2014 )

., 2011 ). However, our observation that the sporozoites' walk statistics change in proximity to blood vessels indicates that there is a specific recognition event that leads to this change. Sporozoites appear to engage in two types of motility: ‘avascular motility’ which is likely to optimize dispersal, and ‘perivascular motility’ defined by more confined trajectories with increased curvature

. More work is needed to determine if this is the case, however, our data with both TRAP-VAL and CSΔN mutant sporozoites demonstrate that the sporozoite's ability to regulate its adhesive intereactions is a key factor for successful movement through and out of the dermis. We show that wild-type control sporozoites spend over a quarter of their time engaging with blood vessels, frequently without successful entry into the blood circulation

., 2014 ). In addition to the change in sporozoite trajectories, we found that they also had a significant decrease in speed when in the vicinity of blood vessels. These data build upon and solidify the previous observation of Amino et al., who quantified the speed of a small number of sporozoites gliding around blood vessels and reported a decrease after contact with the vessel ( Amino et al., 2006 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07789. 020 To determine whether the mutant sporozoites undergo a similar switch from ‘avascular motility’ to ‘perivascular motility’ when approaching a blood vessel, we manually tracked mutant sporozoites and produced two data sets, as described above, for sporozoites moving in proximity to CD31-labeled structures and for sporozoites gliding in areas without CD31-labeled vessels

. Sporozoite motility, a substrate-dependent gliding motility, is essential for the exit from the dermis, and as a result for sporozoite infectivity ( Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004; Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011; Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). In comparison to fast migrating mammalian cells, such as lymphocytes and neutrophils, sporozo motility in the dermis is relatively slow ( Hellmann et al. 201 )

    Title: Evolutionary adaptation after crippling cell polarization follows reproducible trajectories
    Abstract: Cells are organized by functional modules, which typically contain components whose removal severely compromises the module's function. Despite their importance, these components are not absolutely conserved between parts of the tree of life, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 1000 generations without the important polarity gene BEM1. Initially the bem1∆ lineages rapidly increase in fitness and then slowly reach >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization reveals a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.

    We followed the evolutionary adaptation to the removal of an important component of the module that polarizes budding yeast cells. Cells recovered by following a reproducible evolutionary trajectory that could be largely explained by the interactions amongst the mutated genes and led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization

. g., the loss of 88 genes in the descent of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from an ancestor that existed 100 Mya ago [Gordon et al., 2009] ), and the recruitment of new functions by adaptations that alter the function of existing genes and create genes de novo ( Neme and Tautz, 2013, 2014 ). Our evolution experiment created a related set of rapid polarizing mechanisms

. In addition, bem1∆ cells often contain more than one polarity site, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker. 10. 7554/eLife. 09638. 012Figure 4. Three adaptive mutations change polarization dynamics to re-establish efficient polarization

. We decided to delete Bem1 because previous research suggests that this protein is a relatively young component in polarity establishment that had a different role in ancestral fungi ( Semighini and Harris, 2008 ). Deleting this component of polarity could thus reveal other alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules. 10. 7554/eLife. 09638. 003Figure 1. BEM1 is an important polarity gene

. We interpret our results as demonstrating that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt, by evolution, to very strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties

. Systematic analysis of the interactions between the mutated genes revealed epistatic interactions that explained the evolutionary trajectory that gradually improved cell polarization. We discuss the role of loss-of-function mutations in the evolution of populations outside the laboratory.

. The bem1∆ cells that did polarize, ( Figure 1D, Ppolarize_bem1∆ = 0. 23, N = 35 ), polarize fast, in contrast to wild-type cells, which show a wider distribution of polarization times, but always eventually polarize successfully ( Figure 1D, Ppolarize_wt = 1, N = 41 ). We used a single bem1∆ colony, as well as a control, wild-type colony, as the starting point for our evolution experiments

. The module we perturbed was polarization in budding yeast ( Smith et al., 2002; Slaughter et al., 2009a; Howell et al., 2012; Freisinger et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2013; Klunder et al., 2013; Wu and Lew, 2013; Kuo et al., 2014 ). Polarization involves selection of an axis of polarity, followed by the asymmetric organization of cytoskeletal elements and membranous organelles and cell wall growth along this axis

. Second, by biophysically investigating how cells recover from the deletion of BEM1 as well as other perturbations in the polarity pathway, we will be able to distill which parts of polarization mechanisms, rather than molecules, are essential for proper function

Genetic analysis revealed that this recovery followed a reproducible trajectory in which the same genes, which regulate polarization, were inactivated in the same order

. yeastgenome. org ) have not shown physical or genetic interactions between NRP1 and any of the currently known polarity genes. BEM1, BEM2, and BEM3 as well as their genetic interactions have been measured and implicated in polarity establishment before ( Koh et al., 2010 ). However, the lack of information about NRP1 made it impossible to predict the positive effect of the BEM2 deletion on polarity establishment in the absence of BEM1 and BEM3

. First, it can help to identify the role of new genes in polarity establishment; previous work has implicated Nrp1 in RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, and the formation of stress granules, whereas our experiments demonstrate that it regulates cell polarization, directly or indirectly. High-throughput studies, at least as indicated on the yeast genome website SGD ( www. yeastgenome

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09638. 014 The nature of the mutated genes suggests how inactivating them improves the polarization of bem1∆ cells. BEM3 and BEM2 encode two of the four GAPs ( GTPase Activating Proteins ) in the polarity module that inactivate Cdc42 ( Zheng et al., 1994 ) and other small G proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity. Inactivating these genes should increase Cdc42 activity

. Deciphering the physical mechanisms of polarity establishment in all the different combinations of mutants will teach us about evolution of functional modules. However, it will also reveal more about cell biology of polarization

. As predicted, bem1∆ bem3∆ cells bud faster ( Video 6, Figure 4C ), but the cells still often contain more than one polarity site, suggesting that increasing Cdc42 activity is not enough to re-establish precise positive feedback in the absence of Bem1. 10. 7554/eLife. 09638. 015Video 6. Cell polarization in bem1∆ bem3∆ cells. Conditions are identical to Video 4; however, the cells in the video are bem1∆ bem3∆ double mutants

. If this process was accompanied by the recruitment of novel proteins, it could ultimately lead to an evolutionary shift that replaced one module with another unrelated one that performed the same function. One objection to this hypothesis is that it would be very hard to fix a mutation as deleterious as bem1∆

. ( Figure 3C ) : adding the bem2∆ mutation increases the growth rate of bem1∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ cells, but the same mutation reduces or has no effect on the fitness of all other tested genotypes. Another example of epistasis is the changing dependence of the cells on BEM1: the polarization module evolves from requiring Bem1, in wild-type strains, to being slightly impaired by the presence of functional Bem1 in a bem2∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ mutant ( Figure 3D )

. BEM1 is an important polarity gene. ( A ) Cartoon showing the components of the machinery for cell polarization relevant for this work.

. Figure 3C shows that bem1∆ spores are least likely to form colonies, while bem1∆ bem2∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ spores closely resemble wild-type spores, confirming that inactivating BEM2, BEM3, and NRP1 substantially suppresses the severe polarization defect of bem1∆ cells. We compared the growth rate of quadruply mutant bem1∆ bem2∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ cells with the final populations of line A1 and A2 ( Figure 3D )

We examined how the cell size distribution, which is an approximation for polarization dynamics ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ), changed during the experiment: cells that take longer to polarize are on average larger than cells that polarize fast because yeast cells continue to grow during polarity establishment ( Goranov et al., 2009 )

Cells are organized by functional modules, which contain components whose removal severely compromises the module's function. Despite their importance, these components are not conserved across the tree of life, suggesting cells can perform the same functions with different proteins. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 100 generations without the polarity gene BEM1. Initially, bem1 lineages increase in fitness then reach 90% of their B1 ancestors' fitness at the end. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring reveals a common evolutionary trajectory with a sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically perturbations and suggest recovery by inactivation can lead to divergence in cell biologically functions.

We followed the adaptation to removal of an important component of the module that polarizes yeast. Cells recovered by a reproducible evolutionary that could largely be explained by interactions amongst mutated and led a substantial recovery in speed and accuracy of polarization. The loss of 88 genes in Saccharomy cerevisiae from an ancestor 100 My ago and recruitment of new functions that alter existing and create de novo. Our experiment created a set of rapid polarizing mechanisms. bem1 cells contain more than one polarity, suggesting positive feedback ensures single site is weaker. Three adaptive change dynamics re-establish efficient polarization.

We deleted B1 because research suggests this is a young component in establishment had a role in ancestral fungi. Deleting this could reveal alternative, more evolutionarily modules. B1 is an important gene. We interpret results demonstrating multiple regulation allow cells polar rapidly and adapt to strong perturbations. Under selective, larger target mutations inactivate proteins favor trajectories remove components over those quantitatively alter properties. Systematic analysis interactions revealed epist that explained the trajectory improved polarization. We discuss loss-function in evolution outside laboratory.

bem1 cells polarize (Polar_b1 = 0.23, N=35) polar fast, in contrast wild cells show wider distribution but eventually polar (Polar_w=1, N=41). We used bem1 colony as well as control as starting for experiments. The module perturbed polarization yeast (Smith et al, 200; Slaughter et,200a; Howell,201; Freer,201; Gong,201; Klunder,201; Wu, Lew,201; Kuo,201). Polar involves selection axis followed organization cytoskeletal and membran organel wall along axis.

    Title: Neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human medial prefrontal cortex
    Abstract: Neurobiologists have studied decisions by offering successive, independent choices between goods or gambles. However, choices often have lasting consequences, as when investing in a house or choosing a partner. Here, humans decided whether to commit ( by acceptance or rejection ) to prospects that provided sustained financial return. BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex ( rmPFC ) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. By contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected ( or deferred accepting ) a prospect. dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases–to defer commitments to later, and to weight potential losses more heavily than gains–that ( paradoxically ) maximised reward in this task. These findings offer fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions, and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex.

    Previous studies have examined the neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering participants a succession of independent gambles or unrelated consumer choices ( Daw et al., 2006; Plassmann et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2013 ). Here, we devised a task in which decisions involved commitment to an asset with enduring financial consequences

. The aim of the current work was to understand the computational mechanisms by which economic commitments are made in humans, and to investigate their neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex. Commitments often follow a period of deliberation, during which items are considered but final acceptance or rejection is deferred to a later moment ( Shafir and Tversky, 1992; Shafir, 1993 )

., 2011; Kolling et al., 2012 ). In either case however, it remains unknown whether this value difference coding depends on whether stimuli are accepted or rejected, because when deciding between two prospects, an option may be chosen either because it was preferred, or because the alternative was dispreferred. Moreover, it remains unknown how value encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex depends on whether decisions involve economic commitment or not

. Here, thus, we investigated the neural mechanisms that accompany commitment ( acceptance, rejection ), and deferral ( failure to accept or reject ) during economic choice, using a multi-alternative choice task in which decisions had financial ramifications that persisted over prolonged episodes, and could not be reversed. In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting ( inclusion by commitment ) and deferring acceptance of a prospect ( exclusion by deferral )

. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded value when a prospect was excluded ( not included ) while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral ( not commitment ). Furthermore, joint consideration of the behavioural data and the dACC activity allowed us to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date, and a bias to weight unfavourable ( excluded ) options more heavily

. Further, the task captured many aspects of economic decisions in the real world: uncertainty about the true value of a prospect, sustained yield accruing from the investment, economic benefit determined collectively by current assets, and the need to trade-off exploration and exploitation. To preview our findings, whole-brain functional neuroimaging during performance of the task revealed a striking dissociation in the medial prefrontal cortex

. However, the issue of how commitments to prospects are made by acceptance or rejection has received less attention in the domain of neuroeconomics ( Furl and Averbeck, 2011; Gluth et al., 2012 ). During choices among two or more options with uncertain value, activity in anterior rmPFC has been shown to signal the relative advantage of the chosen or attended option over its competitors ( Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006; Lim et al., 2011; Hunt et al

., 2012; Kolling et al., 2012; Boorman et al., 2013 ), studies have revealed that two interconnected medial cortical regions, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) and the rostromedial prefrontal cortex ( rmPFC ), play a pivotal role in reward-guided decision-making, although the relative contribution of these regions remains a focus of lively debate ( Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Rangel and Hare, 2010; Rushworth et al., 2011 )

. Our findings suggests that the rmPFC is involved in integrating value in the service of prospective states, whereas the value coding in the dACC is relevant to whether a currently-available prospect is preferred or not. As such, these findings support the view that the hierarchy of control signals observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex is similarly instated in the medial prefrontal cortex ( Kouneiher et al., 2009; Summerfield and Koechlin, 2009 ).

. Whereas previous tasks have sought to mimic the experience of a gambler choosing which one-armed bandit has the highest yield, our experiment captures that of a consumer deciding to sell an ageing car or of an animal electing whether to accept a prospective mate. This approach thus allowed us to model the factors that drive everyday economic commitments, and to measure how brain activity differed when commitments were made relative to when they were deferred to a later time

., 2014 ). In summary, asking participants to commit to economic alternatives revealed a striking dissociation between the dACC and rmPFC, two brain structures whose contribution to economic choice in the primate remains highly contentious ( Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Rangel and Hare, 2010; Rushworth et al., 2011 )

., 1994 ), for example contributing to episodic future thinking ( Schacter and Addis, 2007 ). BOLD activity in this region resembles firing rates of ‘integration’ neurons that build up to the point of choice and then falls away ( Roitman and Shadlen, 2002 ). The wider function of the rmPFC in humans may be to integrate value across time and assets, potentially to calculate the value of prospective states or investments

. This approach allowed us to investigate how value was coded according to two key axes: whether decisions expressed preference or anti-preference; and whether a commitment ( acceptance or rejection ) was made immediately, or deferred into the future. We found a striking dissociation in the neural data; the dACC encoded value differentially as a function of the former axis ( encoding value only when a prospect was anti-preferred i. e., rejected or not accepted )

. Our finding thus provides an adaptive explanation for violations of description invariance, or preference reversal due to ‘framing effects’ in economic choice tasks ( Shafir, 1993; De Martino et al., 2006; Tsetsos et al., 2012 ). The dACC was sensitive to the main effect of commit vs defer, but dACC BOLD signals also correlated with value when participants rejected ( or failed to accept ) a prospect

. 85, p < 0. 00006 ) and where activity typically correlates the expected value during independent choices ( O’Doherty et al., 2001; Plassmann et al., 2007 ). This sensitivity to value during deliberation but not at commitment in the rmPFC is reminiscent of single neurons in the parietal cortex that parametrically encode confidence about sensory signals but drop off precipitously at the choice point ( Roitman and Shadlen, 2002 )

., 2011 ), or the value of choosing a food item relative to that of foraging elsewhere ( Kolling et al., 2012 ). However, past work has precluded the segregation of neural activity on trials where a commitment was made, relative to those where commitment was deferred into the future

. In the other half of the blocks, participants chose between rejecting ( exclusion by commitment ) and deferring rejection ( inclusion by deferral ). Therefore, preference for a bandit would be implied by commitment in rule-in and deferral in rule-out. Our task, thus, allowed us to probe value encoding in the prefrontal cortex as a function of whether a stimulus was preferred ( i. e., included or excluded ) and whether commitment was made now or deferred until later

. However, many ( perhaps most ) economic behaviours are not well captured by this paradigm, because rather than involving successive, independent choices, they require investment—that is, long-term commitment to a prospect in anticipation of sustained economic return, and with penalties incurred by any future change of mind

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03701. 006 In standard paradigms involving one-shot decisions between two alternatives, BOLD signals in more rostral portions of the medial frontal cortex tend to correlate positively with the value of a preferred ( or chosen ) option relative to an anti-preferred or unchosen option ( Boorman et al., 2009; Hunt et al., 2012 )

. e., rejected or not accepted ). By contrast, the rmPFC encoded value differentially along the latter axis, covarying with value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, and not at the point of commitment. This latter profile of activity is consistent with a role in integrating signals over time, to calculate the value of prospective states or investments. The dACC, on the other hand, encoded value only when a prospect was excluded ( not included ) and BOLD signals in this region correlated with decision biases to defer to later and weight unfavourable options more heavily than favourable ones. This dissociation between the dACC and rmFC is consistent with the view that the hierarchy of signals observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex is instated in the medialfrontal ( Koui et al,2009; Summer and Koe,2009 ), and offers fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and computation in the prefrontal cortex

Our findings suggest that the rmFC is involved in integrating value over prospective states, whereas the dACC is relevant to whether a currently available prospect is preferred or not. This is consistent with the view that the hierarchy of control signals in the prefrontal cortex is instated in the medialfront ( Koui et al,2009 Summer andoe,2009 ), and offers insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and computation in the prefrontal cortex. The dACC was sensitive to the effect of commit vs defer, but d BOLD signals also correlated with value when participants rejected or failed to accept a prospect. This sensitivity to deliberation but not commitment in the rmFC is reminiscent of neurons in parietal that parametrically encode confidence about signals but drop off precipitously at choice ( Roit and Shlen,2002 ) or value of choosing food relative to foraging elsewhere (Koll et,201 ) However, past has precluded segregation of neural on trials where commitment was made relative to deferred into future. The task allowed us to probe value in prefrontal as function of whether stimulus was preferred or excluded and commitment made now or deferred later.

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

**Title:** Neural mechanisms of commitment in the human medial prefrontal cortex

**Summary:** Researchers investigated how humans make economic decisions involving commitment, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. They found that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encoded value when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encoded value when a prospect was rejected or accepted, and BOLD signals reflected biases to defer to later and weight losses more heavily than gains. These findings offer insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and computation in the prefrontal cortex.

**Key findings:**

* The rmFC encoded value when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future
* ACC encoded value when a prospect was rejected or accepted
* BOLD signals in ACC correlated with biases to defer to later and weight unfavourable options more than favourable
* Dissociation between ACC and rmFC consistent with view that hierarchy of signals in prefrontal is instated in medialfront
* rmFC involved integrating value over prospective states, ACC relevant to whether currently available prospect preferred or not
* ACC sensitive to effect of commit vs defer, but BOLD also correlated with value when rejected or failed to accept prospect

**Implications:** This study captures aspects of economic decisions in real world, such as uncertainty of value of prospect, sustained accruing from investment, and need to trade-off exploration and exploitation. It offers fresh insights into pressures that shape economic decisions and computation in prefront cortex.

    Title: Circadian RNA expression elicited by 3’-UTR IRAlu-paraspeckle associated elements
    Abstract: Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies form around the long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and RNA-binding proteins. While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences ( IRAlu ). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.

   ., 2008; Chen and Carmichael, 2008 ). Therefore, this nuclear retention pathway of IRAlus in 3’-UTRs of genes provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus. We recently reported that two protein components of paraspeckles, namely NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in primary cultures of pituitary cells as well as in a rat pituitary cell line, the GH4C1 cells ( Becquet et al., 2014; Guillaumond et al., 2011 )

., 2012 ). Furthermore, on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both, we showed a loss of rhythmic pattern when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. It is now widely admitted that post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level

. Given their presumed functions in gene expression through corresponding mRNA nuclear retention and since they display a circadian expression pattern, it may be assumed that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene

., 2014; Guillaumond et al., 2011 ). We used this cell line to determine whether one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms allowing circadian gene expression in pituitary cells could involve the circadian nuclear mRNA retention by paraspeckle bodies. To this end, we first characterized the presence of paraspeckles and we showed that these nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat GH4C1 pituitary cell line

., 2014; Zarnack et al., 2013 ) it may be speculated that some of these RNA-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression pattern accounting for the weak EGFP circadian expression observed in Alu-egfp cell line. Among the identified RNA-binding proteins that target antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs, HNRNPC was shown to display a circadian expression pattern in several tissues including the mouse pituitary ( see CIRCA: http://circadb. hogeneschlab. org/ )

., 2010 ). In a previous study, we reported that two paraspeckle proteins, namely NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in rat pituitary cells ( Guillaumond et al., 2011 ) and we find here that it is also the case for the two other 'classical' paraspeckle proteins, PSPC1 and RBM14. Furthermore, all four proteins bind rhythmically to Neat1, suggesting that the pools of proteins involved in paraspeckle composition vary with time

. Finally, in GH4C1 cells, the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown here to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells. It may then be assumed that the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA described here in a number of mouse tissue also reflects variations in paraspeckle number although it cannot be excluded that paraspeckle size could also oscillate over the circadian period both in pituitary cells and in other oscillators

. In agreement with this view, the new mechanism described here suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies.

. We showed also that insertion of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of EGFP reporter gene allowed rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention and rhythmic EGFP protein expression. Finally, this rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention as well as the rhythmic nuclear retention of some known cycling transcripts that were shown here associated with paraspeckles was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted.

. In keeping with this view, we showed that IRAlu elements inserted in 3’-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression

. In addition, the lncRNA Neat1 itself displays a circadian expression pattern and we further found using a pair of primers allowing the specific detection of the long form of Neat1 RNA, Neat1-2 ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) that the expression of this form known to be sufficient for the formation of paraspeckle displays a circadian pattern ( data not shown )

. Nuclear retention of egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cells is no more cycling when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that the nuclear retention of the reporter gene by paraspeckles contributes to cycling

. However, it may be noticed that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3’-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line

. It then appeared that silencing EGFP expression mechanism relied on egfp mRNA nuclear retention. To obtain evidence that nuclear retained IRAlus are associated with paraspeckle bodies, we immunoprecipitated RNA complexes containing paraspeckle protein PSPC1 and characterized the associated egfp mRNA. We found IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA to be associated with PSPC1 whereas Alu-containing egfp mRNA was not

. These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression. Since antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs can be the target of several RNA-binding proteins ( Kelley et al., 2014; Zarnack et al

. hogeneschlab. org/ ). This is not the case for HNRNPU and STAUFEN 1 ( STAU1 ) -mediated messenger RNA decay we did not find to display a circadian expression pattern in GH4C1 cells ( Guillaumond et al., 2011 ) and ( data not shown ) and are then unlikely involved in circadian EGFP expression in Alu-egfp cell line. The mechanism involved in the circadian nuclear retention of Alu-containing egfp mRNA remains anyway to be determined

. The circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA is not the privilege of 'in vitro' pituitary cells since it is also found 'ex vivo' in several mouse tissues including the pituitary gland but also numerous other peripheral oscillators such as the spleen or the adrenal gland. This holds also true for the central clock, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei

., 2012; Hurley et al., 2014 ). While in eukaryotes, approximately 1%-10% genes are subjected to circadian control directly or indirectly only ~1/5 of the mRNAs that display rhythmic expression are directly driven by transcription, which suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic export and RNAs nuclear retention are essential layers for generation of gene expression rhythmicity ( Partch et al

. We then developed a technique to characterize nuclear mRNA Neat1 targets using a Neat1 RNA pull-down approach that allowed us to show the association of IRAlu egfp mRNA with Neat1 providing a much more convincing evidence for a nuclear retention of IRAlu egfp mRNA by paraspeckles

. To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale, we characterized in our pituitary cells the list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes and we analyzed in publicly available datasets the known cycling transcripts that are included in this Neat1 RNA target list

The study investigated the circadian expression of paraspeck components and their role in post-transcriptional control of gene expression in pituitary cells. Parasck are nuclear bodies that form around long noncoding RNA Ne1 and RNA-binding proteins. They are believed to control gene expression by retaining mRNAs in their 3’-UT inverted repeats of Al sequences (IRu). The study found that parasck components, including major proteins and Ne1, displayed circadian expression in pituitary cells. Insertion of IRu at 3’-UT of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of egfp mRNA and EGFP expression, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Real-time microscopy showed IRu drove circadian EGFP expression. The study suggests that parasck control circadian expression postcriptionally by retaining mRNAs in the nucleus.

Parasck components, including NON, SFP, PSP1, and RB14, displayed circadian expression in pitary cells. Insertion of IRu at 3-UT of EGFP led to rhythmic nuclear retention egfp and EG expression, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. IRu elements in 3- of egfp allowed rhythmic nuclear retention and EG expression. The study also found that Ne1, a component of parasck, displayed circadian expression and its long form, Ne1-2, was sufficient for parasck formation and displayed circadian expression. Nuclear egfp retention in IRu-eg cells was lost when parasck were disrupted.

The study showed that IRu-containing egfp mRNA was associated with parasck protein PSP1, while Al-containing egfp was not. IRu elements in 3 of eg allowed rhythmic nuclear retention and EG expression. The study suggests that parasck retain mRN in the nucleus leading to rhythmic expression. The circadian pattern of Ne1 was found in pitary and other tissues, including spleen, adrenal gland, and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Post-transcription mechanisms, including splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, cytoplasm export, and nuclear retention, are essential for gene rhythmic expression.

The study characterized Ne1 targets using RNA pull-down and found IRu egfp associated with Ne1, providing evidence for nuclear retention by parasck. In pitary cells, the list of putative Ne1 target genes was characterized and cycling transcripts were analyzed. The study suggests that parasck impact on rhythmic expression occurs in vivo on a larger scale.

    Title: The active-zone protein Munc13 controls the use-dependence of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
    Abstract: Presynaptic calcium channel function is critical for converting electrical information into chemical communication but the molecules in the active zone that sculpt this function are poorly understood. We show that Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, also controls presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel ( VGCC ) function dictating their behavior during various forms of activity. We demonstrate that in vitro Munc13 interacts with voltage-VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in Munc13's C2B domain. We show that elimination of this interaction by either removal of Munc13 or replacement of Munc13 with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and alters calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These studies illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and show that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.

    Supporting Text:
   . Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the presence of this critical active-zone protein has potent influence on VGCC function and delineates a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The strong dependence of exocytosis on Ca2+ influx and the control of VGCC function on fast time scales imply that synaptic throughput can be actively controlled by such VGCC-active-zone protein interactions. The fact that many presynaptic proteins interact with VGCCs ( Hans et al

., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013 ). Here, we provide compelling evidence that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs in a way that controls calcium channel use-dependence on millisecond to second time scales at nerve terminals. We pinpointed a critical interaction site to 2 basic residues within the C2B domain of Munc13 on a face that is orthogonal to the potential membrane-interacting loops of this domain

The observation that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions has broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. Our data strongly imply that this modulation is mediated by a direct VGCC-Munc13 interaction although we cannot exclude that synprint interaction site on Munc13 C2B influences interactions with other proteins in situ that in turn modulate VGCCs

. To test for the possible significance of the Munc13–VGCC interaction, we therefore examined the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. We recently showed that expression of an shRNA targeting the major cortical isoforms Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 ( Munc13-KD ) led to a 94% or greater depletion of this protein at nerve terminals that results in complete block of exocytosis ( Rangaraju et al., 2014 )

. The fact that VGCC failed to reactivate in 1. 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ WT cells but not in Munc13-KR/AA rescue suggests that the increase in exocytosis during 2 ms ISI paired pulses in Munc13-KR/AA is a direct effect of the lack of Munc13-VGCC interaction and not a secondary effect of reduced exocytosis. We therefore conclude that this interaction site in Munc13's C2B domain mediates VGCC channel reactivation in nerve terminals. 10. 7554/eLife. 07728. 010Figure 7

. Synaptic transmission relies on two distinct molecular pathways for neurotransmitter release: the preparation of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles to a docked state at the active-zone and action potential-driven opening of voltage-gated calcium channels ( VGCCs ) causing rapid elevation of intracellular calcium in the vicinity of these vesicles

Munc13 isoforms contain numerous protein–protein and protein–ligand interaction domains. These include a Ca2+ and lipid-interacting C2B domain homologous to the C2B domains of synaptotagmin-1 and RIM1, which are known to interact with the synaptic protein interaction ( synprint ) region on CaV2. 2 ( Sheng et al., 1997; Chapman et al., 1998; Coppola et al., 2001 ) ( Figure 1A ). Since Munc13 is known to be targeted to regions of the presynaptic membrane rich in VGCCs ( Weimer et al

. Loss of Munc13 at hippocampal nerve terminals profoundly alters the response of VGCCs during brief AP bursts of very high-frequency firing. Although re-expression of Munc13-harboring point mutations that prevent interaction with VGCCs in Munc13-KD synapses restores exocytosis, it does not rescue the alterations in VGCC function. As a result, synapses expressing this mutant Munc13 have profound changes in ultra-fast plasticity of the exocytic response as well

. s. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07728. 009 Because we observed a Munc13-mediated reduction in VGCC reactivation with 2 ms ISI-paired pulses, we tested the physiological consequences of such stimuli at the level of presynaptic exocytosis

. Thus, the decrease in single AP presynaptic Ca2+-influx in the absence of Munc13 could arise from changes in surface abundance of VGCCs or changes in gating properties. To look for possible changes in gating properties, we examined how loss of Munc13 impacted functional plasticity of AP-driven presynaptic Ca2+ influx on time scales that would be too fast ( ms to s ) to involve membrane trafficking events to and from the cell surface. 10. 7554/eLife. 07728. 004Figure 2

., 2007; Roberts-Crowley et al., 2009 ). The recent observation that Ca2+ channels may be highly diffusible in the presynaptic membrane ( Schneider et al., 2015 ) provides another potential mechanism by which interactions with active zone proteins such as Munc13 could modulate effective Ca2+ influx. Complex high-frequency spike bursts have been recorded from many brain regions, including hippocampus ( Kandel and Spencer, 1961 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07728. 004 To investigate an underlying mechanism of Munc13's control of Ca2+ influx in presynaptic boutons that would be separate from changes in VGCC surface abundance, we first examined how the absence of Munc13 might influence the ability of VGCCs to recover from bursts of activity. Changes in Ca2+ influx after the burst would be consistent with alteration in VGCC kinetics of inactivation and/or recovery from protracted stimuli

. We previously showed that expression of TeNT-LC in these cells eliminates exocytosis ( Rangaraju et al., 2014 ). Simply eliminating exocytosis, however, did not change the reactivation behavior of presynaptic VGCCs ( Figure 4B, G ) probed with 2 AP stimulation with a 2 ms ISI, which were indistinguishable from that observed in WT synapses. Thus, the observed fast paired-pulse depression in presynaptic Ca2+ influx is not exocytosis driven

. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis was smaller for Munc13-KR/AA rescue than WT cells as one would predict from the reduced Ca2+ influx in Munc13-KR/AA rescues and the steep relationship between Ca2+ influx and vesicle exocytosis ( Ariel and Ryan, 2010 ). In fact, exocytosis in Munc13-KR/AA rescue in response to single AP was similar to that measured in WT cells in the presence of 1. 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ ( not shown ). The fact that VGCC failed to reactivate in 1

. At present, a number of presynaptic proteins, including key active-zone proteins such as RIM and ELKS/bruchpilot are known to interact with VGCCs, but the interactions have been shown largely to control VGCC localization and abundance ( Kittel et al., 2006 ). It will be interesting in the future to see what active-zone protein interactions are necessary to allow function of Munc13 on VGCCs

. Indeed, Ca2+ influx recorded at the soma in response to 2 ms spaced pairs of stimuli in WT cells had almost identical properties to presynaptic responses in Munc13-KD cells for Figure 4F, G. Our data are thus consistent with the idea that Munc13 actively modulates VGCC properties in the active zone. We further examined the persistence of this refractory state of VGCCs by examining paired-pulse Ca2+ influx over a series of ISIs in both WT and Munc13-KD neurons ( Figure 4H )

The active-zone protein, Munc13, plays a central and essential role in all known forms of chemical synaptic transmission ( Augustin et al., 1999; Varoqueaux et al., 2002 ). Munc13 is critical for correct assembly of exocytic proteins in preparation for neurotransmitter release that it executes at least in part through interactions with plasma membrane SNARE protein, syntaxin ( Ma et al., 2012 ). Here we show that M13 also modulates presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels ( VGCC ) controlling their behavior during various forms of activity. We demonstrate in vitro that M13 interacts with VGCC via a pair of basic residues in M13 C2 domain and show that elimination of this interaction either by removal of M13 or replacement M13 with M13 C2 mutant alters VG response and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and calcium influx from single potential. These studies illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and show M13 poised to profoundly impact information transfer at terminals by controlling vesicle priming and trigger exocyt

The authors of this study investigated the role of the active-zone protein M13 in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). They found that M13 interacts with VGCC via a pair of basic residues in the C2 domain of M13 and that this interaction controls the behavior of VGCC during various forms of activity. They also showed that elimination of this interaction by removal of M13 or replacement of M13 with M13 C mutant alters VG's response and recovery from high-frequency potential bursts and calcium influx from single potential. This study illustrates a novel form of synaptic modulation and shows that M13 is poised to impact information transfer at terminals by controlling vesicle priming and trigger exocyt.

The study provides evidence that M13 has a potent influence on VG function and delineates a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exocyt on Ca+ influx and control of VG function on fast scales imply that synaptic can be controlled by VG-active protein interactions. The fact that many presyn proteins interact VGs (Hans et al, 2013; Zhou et al 2013) here provide evidence that M13 interacts VGs in a way that controls calcium use on millisecond to second scales at terminals. They pinpoint a critical site to basic within C2 domain M13 on that is orthogonal to membrane-interacting loops of this domain.

The observation M13 enhances Ca+ influx and modulates kinetic of VGs across range conditions has implications for understanding transmission controlled. Data imply this is mediated by direct VG-M13 interaction although cannot exclude print site M13 C influences interactions with proteins in situ that turn modulate VGs. To test significance M13-VG interaction they examined impact removing M on potential calcium influx terminals. They showed expression shRNA targeting major isoforms M13-1 and M13-2 (M13D) led 94 depletion protein terminals results block exyt (Raraju et al 2014). VG failed react 1.2 mM extracellular Ca+ cells not M13R/AA suggests increase exyt during 2 ISI pairs M13/AA direct effect lack M-VG interaction not secondary effect exyt. They conclude this site M C domain mediates VG reactivation terminals.

    Title: Why plants make puzzle cells, and how their shape emerges
    Abstract: The shape and function of plant cells are often highly interdependent. The puzzle-shaped cells that appear in the epidermis of many plants are a striking example of a complex cell shape, however their functional benefit has remained elusive. We propose that these intricate forms provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. When tissue-level growth is isotropic, we hypothesize that lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent formation of large isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure. Data from various plant organs and species support the relationship between lobes and growth isotropy, which we test with mutants where growth direction is perturbed. Using simulation models we show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. Together, our results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.

    Supporting Text:
    We propose that the puzzle shaped cells seen in the epidermis of many plant species emerge from a mechanism that evolved to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. FEM analysis of 3D pressurized cells shows that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. When an epidermal cell becomes large in two directions ( i. e. has a large open area ), stress is greatly increased

. But how do cells avoid excessive stress if they are part of a tissue that grows in two directions, such as the surface of broad leaves? Here we propose that the puzzle cell shape, with lobes and indentations, provides a solution to this problem. To test this hypothesis, we began by analyzing the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana

. In stems, roots and siliques, growth is strongly anisotropic, and cells can simply elongate. This is, however, not possible for isodiametric organs such as broad leaves, cotyledons and silicle fruit pods. We propose that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of more isodiametric plant organs provide a means to avoid large open areas in the cell and the high stresses that they induce

. This strict correspondence between fruit shape and puzzle-shaped epidermal cells fits the prediction of our model that puzzle shapes are required to allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues, but are not required in elongated organs. Our model predicts that plant cells regulate their shape to prevent their LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large

. Here we propose a different function for the puzzle shape, that it is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces that act on turgid plant cells that reside in the epidermis. Mechanically, plant cells are like small balloons inflated with considerable turgor pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells ( Forouzesh et al., 2013 ), reaching values up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata ( Franks et al., 2001 )

. For epidermal cells composing the outermost cell layer in each organ, minimizing mechanical stress on their walls is likely particularly important as the epidermis limits organ growth and is under tension from internal tissues ( Savaldi-Goldstein et al., 2007; Kutschera and Niklas, 2007; Beauzamy et al., 2015 ). Here we explore the relationship between cell shape and mechanical stress, to understand if mechanical stress is a morphological constraint in shaping epidermal cells

. Since turgor pressure inside cells is high, minimizing mechanical stress by shape regulation may be a way of reducing the resources required to reinforce the cell wall and at the same time maintaining its structural integrity during growth. Although it is possible that the interlocking puzzle-shaped cells have a role in strengthening the epidermal cell layer ( Glover, 2000; Jacques et al

. Parameter variation also demonstrates that the model can generate a diverse range of plausible cell shapes, similar to those observed in nature ( e. g. Figure 3—figure supplement 2B 60% isotropy; which are reminiscent of epidermal cells in maize leaves ). To validate the model, we confirmed in a FEM analysis that limiting the size of the LEC by creating lobes during growth reduces the cellular stress ( Figure 3F–G )

. This causes the maximum stress in simulated tissues to plateau, greatly reducing it compared to isodiametric cells of the same size ( Figure 3H ). The model thus illustrates how a mechanism actively limiting the mechanical stress of cells by restricting large open areas ( LECs ) can lead to the formation of puzzle-shape cells in the context of isotropic growth

., 2014 ). Although the composition of the cell wall is undoubtedly more complex ( reviewed by Cosgrove, 2005; Cosgrove, 2014 ), this suggests that cell shape and mechanical stress are intimately connected. Most plant tissues emerge from undifferentiated cells that are initially small and isodiametrically shaped, and subsequently proliferate, differentiate and expand

. The basic principle behind the model is that as cells grow, stresses gradually increase, and when they reach a threshold level the cell wall is reinforced to resist these stresses. Using simulations on idealized cell templates, we test whether this basic principle is sufficient to generate different cell shapes, depending on the anisotropy of tissue growth

. The emerging cell shapes primarily arise from the growth direction imposed at the tissue level that is locally modulated by stress-based growth restriction. We present the essential aspects of the model here ( Figure 2 ), but refer the reader to the Appendix for further details

During growth and morphogenesis, plant cells undergo dramatic changes in size and shape. Starting from small isodiametric cells in proliferative tissues, cells stop dividing and can expand to over 100 times their original size. This results in large elongated cells, such as those in roots and stems, or much more intricate forms, such as the jigsaw puzzle-shaped epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and cotyledons ( Figure 1A ), which we call puzzle cells

. This causes small indentations in the cell, which transfers more stress to them, further recruiting microtubules and more cellulose deposition. The process generates a local activation feedback of cell shape on growth via the mechanical stresses that are induced by that shape. A geometric-mechanical simulation model of these processes confirms that the hypothesis is plausible, and the model is able to produce puzzle-shaped cells from a few simple assumptions

. We hypothesize that in a strongly anisotropically growing organ the plant would make long thin cells, whereas in more isotropic organs puzzle cells would be produced. Counter-intuitively, it is the requirement for isotropic expansion at the tissue scale that drives the irregular shape of puzzle cells. To test our hypothesis, a method to quantify the puzzle shape of cells was required

. It is commonly observed that the periclinal cell walls slightly bulge out in healthy, turgid cells. However, if stress is indeed a developmental constraint, then when cells grow isotropically without this mechanism, they should bulge excessively, reach their rupture point and burst. The shoot apex of Arabidopsis grows isotropically in areas without lateral organs ( Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003; Kierzkowski et al

. This idea is supported by experimental and modeling work showing that predicted stress directions in puzzle cells align with cortical microtubule direction in Arabidopsis cotyledons ( Sampathkumar et al., 2014 ). Here we propose a dynamic simulation model of puzzle cell patterning based on the idea that cells can respond to mechanical signals generated by cell geometry. The model focuses on the developmental stage when cells stop dividing and begin to expand

. Similar gradients in cell shape are seen in A. thaliana leaves, where elongated cells cover the anisotropically growing midrib, whereas lobed cells adorn the adjacent isotropically growing leaf blade ( Figure 3C ). To explore the effect of model parameters on cell morphology we performed a parameter space exploration using the simulation with isotropic growth as a reference ( Figure 3A )

., 2001 ) Although studies often focus on anisotropic growth at the cellular level when analyzing puzzle cell development ( Armour et al., 2015 ), our hypothesis suggests that isotropic growth at the tissue level is a primary driver of cell shape. As a tissue grows the stress increases, and microtubules align to direct cellulose deposition to resist the stress

., 2015; Belteton et al., 2018 ). Although these studies have elucidated many of the molecular players involved in puzzle cell patterning, a mechanistic theory is lacking, in part because the function of the puzzle-shape in epidermal cells is unclear ( Bidhendi and Geitmann, 2018 ). It has been hypothesized that the interdigitation of the lobes and indentations may strengthen the leaf surface ( Glover, 2000; Jacques et al., 2014; Sotiriou et al

The puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants, such as Arabidopsis thalian leaves and cotyled, emerge from a mechanism that evolved to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. FEM analysis of 3D pressurized cells shows that shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell. When epidermal cells become large in two directions, stress is greatly increased. To avoid excessive stress, puzzle cells with lobes and indentations provide a solution. This hypothesis is tested by analyzing stress in a mechanical model of the cotyled epidermis of Arabidopsis thalian stems and roots, which grow strongly anisotropically and can elongate. However, isodetric organs such as broad leaves, cotyled, and fruit cannot elongate. Puzzle-shaped epider cells in isodetric organs provide a means to avoid large areas in cells and high stresses they induce. The correspondence between fruit and puzzle-shaped epider cells fits the prediction that shapes are required for isotropic tissues but not elongated organs. The model predicts cells regulate shape to prevent LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large.

Mechanical cells are small inflated with turg pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabid leaf cells, reaching up to 50 in specialized cells such as stomata. Epider cells, the outer layer of each organ, minimizing stress on walls is important as epider limits growth and tension from internal tissues. The relationship between cell shape and mechanical is explored to understand if stress is a morphological constraint shaping epider cells. Turg pressure inside is high, minimizing stress by shape may reduce resources to reinforce the cell and maintain integrity during growth. The model generates a range of plausible shapes, similar to observed in nature, such as epider cells in maize. F analysis limiting LEC by lobes during growth reduces cellular stress. The model illustrates a mechanism limiting mechanical stress by restricting large areas LEC leads to puzzle cells in isotropic growth.

    Title: Synergistic assembly of human pre-spliceosomes across introns and exons
    Abstract: Most human genes contain multiple introns, necessitating mechanisms to effectively define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these work together is unclear. We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.

    Supporting Text:
   . This suggests an ordered human pre-spliceosome assembly pathway in which stable U2 association in the presence of ATP requires prior U1 binding, in contrast to the branched pathway observed in S. cerevisiae ( Shcherbakova et al., 2013 ). In multi-intron pre-mRNAs, internal exons have 5'SS both upstream and downstream, either or both of which could bind U1 and act to recruit U2 to the 3'SS. In principle, the two U1s could act either independently or synergistically

Here we establish methods for observing the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extract. The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5'SS are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream ( cross-exon ) or upstream ( cross-intron ) of the 5'SS

. Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways. An intron can be recognized a ) via cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or b ) via cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly ( Moldón and Query, 2010 )

. Models of the type presented in Figure 5 assume that once a functional U1-U2 pre-spliceosome forms across the intron, interactions with U1 bound to the downstream 5'SS provide no additional U2 binding stabilization or stimulation of subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly ( Figure 5, bottom ). Such models predict that the presence of a downstream U1 will not affect the lifetimes of stable U2 complexes once formed

. But the molecular mechanisms contributing to this remarkable accuracy were previously unclear. By implementing CoSMoS in extracts from human cells expressing genetically-tagged proteins, we here show that a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5'SS. This collaboration dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation

. In both the cross-intron and cross-exon contexts, elimination of the canonical 5'SS decreased U2 binding frequency to background within experimental uncertainty ( Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). Absence of U5 binding to these RNAs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 5 ) confirmed that the mutations abolished the formation of functional pre-spliceosomes

. Cross-exon pre-spliceosomes can transition into cross-intron pre-spliceosomes, each having a distinct protein composition; the latter can then productively splice the pre-mRNA ( Chiara and Reed, 1995; Schneider et al., 2010 ). However, the mechanisms by which cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes work together to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing remain unclear. In S

. Cross-intron and cross-exon 5'SS synergy on U2 recruitment rate explains how U1 can have such a strong effect on U2 recruitment despite its association with pre-mRNA being much more dynamic than U2. This mechanism is likely crucial for rapid definition of internal exons in multi-intron RNAs, enabling the human splicing machinery to avoid inappropriate exon skipping.

Spliceosomes consist of the U1, U2, and U4/U6. U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) and multiprotein Prp19-complex as major building blocks, plus many transiently interacting splicing factors ( Wahl et al., 2009 ). This machinery recognizes and assembles stepwise at splice sites ( SS ) ( U1 at 5'SS and U2 at the 3'SS/branch site ) to form pre-spliceosomes, which are subsequently remodeled into catalytically active spliceosomes

We began by investigating whether human nuclear extracts can assemble catalytically-competent spliceosomes on surface-tethered pre-mRNA molecules. To do this, we utilized the pre-mRNA model substrate PIP85A ( Moore and Sharp, 1992 ) ( Figure 1A, Table 1 ). We refer to this RNA here as ‘5i3’ to indicate that, reading in the 5'-to-3' direction, it contains a partial exon, a 5'SS ( ‘5’ ), an intron ( i ), a 3'SS ( ‘3’ ), and another partial exon. For this pre-mRNA 20 ± 2% ( s. d

. For this pre-mRNA 20 ± 2% ( s. d. ) was converted to spliced products after 40 mins in human cell line HEK293 nuclear extract ( Figure 1B ). No spliced products were observed in the absence of ATP, which is required for spliceosome assembly. To monitor splicing of individual 5i3 molecules, we incorporated a green-excited dye into the 5' exon, a red-excited dye into the intron, and biotin at the end of the 3' exon ( Figure 1C )

. Overall, the kinetics of human spliceosomal subcomplex binding and dissociation on the cross-intron 5i3 substrate were similar to those observed in CoSMoS experiments on cross-intron RNAs in S. cerevisiae extracts ( Hoskins et al., 2011; Shcherbakova et al., 2013 ). Spliceosomal subcomplex interactions with the cross-exon 3e5 RNA were quantitatively different from interactions with the cross-intron 5i3 RNA

. We next used the labeled extracts in CoSMoS experiments in which we compared subcomplex dynamics on individual RNAs designed to promote assembly of cross-intron or cross-exon pre-spliceosomes ( Figure 2A ). The cross-intron RNA ( 5i3, Figure 2B ) was identical to that in Figure 1 except that it contained a single red-excited dye adjacent to the biotin tether at the end of the 3' exon

., 2016; Warnasooriya and Rueda, 2014 ). Here we developed the tools necessary to implement colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy ( CoSMoS ) in human cell extracts and used this system to investigate the dynamic mechanism of cross-intron and cross-exon cooperation in human pre-spliceosome assembly.

. In S. cerevisiae, where the cross-intron pathway predominates, single-molecule approaches have proven invaluable for elucidating the kinetic pathways and subcomplex dynamics involved in spliceosome assembly ( Semlow et al., 2016; Warnasooriya and Rueda, 2014 )

. 3e5 RNA molecules exhibited more frequent binding events ( Figure 2F and G ) and higher mean occupancy ( Figure 2I ) for all subcomplexes than 5i3 molecules. These differences might be partially explained by the inability of the cross-exon pre-mRNA to form a catalytically active spliceosome ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ), resulting in the greater accumulation of inactive spliceosome assembly intermediates at steady state

. On human pre-mRNAs, which characteristically harbor multiple long introns and short exons, exon definition predominates ( Berget, 1995; Fox-Walsh et al., 2005 ). Indeed, splicing is greatly enhanced when a 5'SS is present across the exon downstream of an intron, highlighting the importance of exon definition in humans ( Talerico and Berget, 1990; Yue and Akusjärvi, 1999 )

. 3 ± 0. 9 s−1 ) the downstream site. Taken together, our data suggest that the synergistic stimulatory effect of the downstream 5'SS on splicing is exerted at the U2 recruitment step and the processes that enable it, not at the subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly and splicing. Inappropriate skipping of otherwise constitutive internal exons can occur with exceptionally low frequency ( ~1 in 105 splicing events ) ( Fox-Walsh and Hertel, 2009 )

., 1998 ). In contrast, if the upstream and downstream U1s can interact with U2 simultaneously, or independently ( Figure 5, bottom ), the presence of a downstream U will not affect the lifetime of U2 once bound to the 5S ( Figure 5, bottom ). This model is consistent with the observation that U1 binding to the downstream 5S does not increase the lifetime of U2 bound to the 5S ( Figure 5, bottom ) and that U binding to the downstream 5S does not affect the lifetime of U bound to the 5 ( Figure 5, bottom )

    Title: Ubiquitin-dependent folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6
    Abstract: Many membrane proteins fold inefficiently and require the help of enzymes and chaperones. Here we reveal a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ). We show that folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is promoted by ubiquitination of a specific lysine, retaining it in the ER while avoiding degradation. Subsequent ER exit requires removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19. This ubiquitination-deubiquitination is conceptually reminiscent of the glucosylation-deglucosylation occurring in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. To avoid infinite futile cycles, folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are, with time, polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation. This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins as CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2, two poor folders involved in severe human diseases.

    Supporting Text:
   . This work reveals the existence of a novel assisted-folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER and depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination. Upon ubiquitination on Lys-1403, LRP6 presumably interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitoylation ( Abrami et al., 2008b )

. De-glucosidation promotes folding of glycosylated protein, but if folding is too lengthy or fails, de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD. While the here described ubiquitin-dependent folding system was identified for LRP6, it likely also operates on other membrane proteins

. 016Figure 4—figure supplement 1–source data 1. Numeric data for graphs of Figure 4—figure supplement 1. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 19083. 016 We here reveal the existence of an ubiquitin-dependent folding machinery, which operates on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane ( Figure 4C ). More specifically we show that following synthesis, LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403, most likely of a specific form

., 2008b ). If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ERAD. The here identified ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins such as CFTR or the anthrax toxin receptor 2 ( also know as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2 ), loss of function of which leads to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome ( Deuquet et al., 2012 ).

. In conceptual analogy to the binding of newly synthesized mono-glucosylated proteins to calnexin in the ER lumen ( Lamriben et al., 2016 ), we hypothesize that Lys-1403-ubiquitin can interact with a putative ER-ubiquitin binding protein that would also act as a chaperone. Upon release from this putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone, LRP6 is deubiquitinated by USP19

. Here we have further investigated LRP6 biogenesis in the ER. We show that newly synthesized wild type LRP6 also undergoes ubiquitination, on the same site ( Lys-1403 ), and that this post-translational modification promotes its folding. For ER exit to occur, ubiquitination must however be subsequently removed. This is mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19, one of the isoforms of which is tail-anchored to the ER ( Hassink et al., 2009; Wing, 2016 )

., 2008b ), led us to propose the following working hypothesis: following synthesis and insertion into the ER membrane, LRP6 first undergoes ubiquitination, probably of a specific type, on Lys-1403, allowing it to interact with an ER or cytosolic ubiquitin-binding protein. This interaction provides LRP6 with time to fold –and as such this ubiquitin-binding protein would act as a chaperone– protecting it from ERAD targeting. Lys-1403 is then deubiquitinated

. Future studies are required to establish the generality of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system, determine whether it has a built-in quality control, and identify the missing components such as the folding-promoting ubiquitin ligase, the putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone and the degradation-targeting ligase ( Figure 4C ). All these enzymes could be exploited to control Wnt signaling in the context of disease.

. Palmitoylation, which favors ER exit ( Abrami et al., 2008b ), could prevent LRP6 from Lys-1403 ubiquitination, possibly through a conformational change of steric hindrance given the juxtamembrane localization of both modifications. A major prediction of this model is the existence of an ER localized deubiquitinating ( DUB ) enzyme that can remove ubiquitin specifically from Lys-1403. This DUB would control LRP6 biogenesis. The human genome encodes some 100 DUBs ( Clague et al

. Lys-1403 is then deubiquitinated. At this stage, LRP6 can either ( 1 ) undergo palmitoylation of its two juxtamembranous cysteine residues, followed by ER exit, ( 2 ) be re-ubiquitinated on Lys-1403, or ( 3 ) be polyubiquitinated on one of the other 16 cytoplasmic lysine residues and sent to ERAD. Option 1, re-ubiquitination on Lys-1403, allows LRP6 to undergo a second cycle of interaction with its ubiquitin-binding chaperone, further promoting folding

. Following USP19 deubiquitination, LRP6 can, if properly folded, exit the ER, an events possibly promoted by palmitoylation of cysteines in the vicinity of Lys-1403 ( Abrami et al., 2008b ). Or, LRP6 can undergo a new cycle of Lys-1403-specific ubiquitination and chaperone binding. Upon prolonged presence in the ER, LRP6 undergoes polyubiquitination on other cytosolic lysines, leading to ERAD targeting

. In the ER, LRP6 can thus undergo two types of ubiquitination events, which operate with different kinetics: ( 1 ) specific ubiquitination on Lys-1403 which promotes folding, ( 2 ) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines which promotes ERAD. These two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen, which also occur with different kinetics

While protein folding may be extremely efficient, the presence of multiple domains, in soluble or membrane proteins, greatly reduces the efficacy of the overall process. Thus, a set of enzymes and chaperones assist folding and ensure that a sufficient number of active molecules reach their final destination ( Brodsky and Skach, 2011; Ellgaard et al., 2016 ). Even with help, folding may remain inefficient and thereby sensitive to errors or mutations, leading to disease

., 2009; Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012 ). Most transmembrane proteins, which jointly compose 30% of the human proteome, are synthesized by ER-bound ribosomes and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane ( Ellgaard et al., 2016; Xu and Ng, 2015 ). Subsequent folding must proceed in three topological environments: the ER lumen, the membrane and the cytosol. In each of these environments, the protein may benefit from the help of chaperones and folding enzymes

. The tripple LRP6K1403RCC−SS mutant was therefore the least stable ( Figure 2F ). Altogether these observations indicate that spontaneous folding of LRP6 is very inefficient, and that both ubiquitination and palmitoylation promote LRP6 biogenesis and ER exit. The process is however not all-or-none, i. e. even in the absence of Lys-1403 and/or palmitoylation, a small population of molecules folds properly and exits the ER

. We have previously shown that exit of LRP6 from the ER also requires a cytoplasmic post-translational modification, namely S-palmitoylation, on two cysteine residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain ( Abrami et al., 2008b ). LRP6 acylation influences the conformation of this domain, possibly by alleviating the hydrophobic mismatch between the thickness of the lipid bilayer and the thickness of the transmembrane helix.

    Title: Sex differences in learning from exploration
    Abstract: Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get ‘stuck’ in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

   ., 2019; Pisupati et al., 2019 ), sex-differences in exploration could contribute to performance differences and variability seen across tasks and speciess ( Grissom and Reyes, 2019; van den Bos et al., 2013 ). To examine whether there are sex differences in exploration, we trained male and female mice on a classic explore/exploit task, a spatial restless two-armed bandit ( Ebitz et al., 2018 ). Males showed higher levels of exploration than females throughout the task

., 2021b ). Here, we applied computational tools to characterize sex differences in the latent variables underlying behavior to understand sex differences in a key cognitive process regulating reward-guided behaviors: balancing exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, we must balance two goals: exploiting rewarding options when they are available, but also exploring alternatives that could be more rewarding or provide new information about the world

. The results of HMM model and RL models revealed significant sex differences in exploration, paralleled by sex differences in rate of learning. What remains unclear is how sex, explore-exploit states, and reward outcomes all interact together to influence the animals’ choices

Sex mechanisms biasing the preferred approaches taken during cognitive tasks are potentially significant contributors to task performance. We used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment

. 00001 ). To understand how reward and reward omission differentially affect choice across sexes, we conducted post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses. We found that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely than the males to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial ( Figure 4A, sex X reward interaction, p < 0. 000001, Supplementary file 1; post hoc t-test: t ( 254 ) = 5. 53, p < 0. 0001 )

., 2014 ), allowing enhanced DA release and faster DA clearance in females ( Becker, 1999 ). This mechanism could contribute to increased reward learning observed in females during exploration. The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ), which receives dopamine projections, is a target brain region to understand exploration and exploitation ( Ebitz et al., 2018; Jenni et al., 2017 ). Our previous study implicated PFC in the differences in learning strategy between males and females ( Chen et al

. Together, these results demonstrate that while the overall performance was similar, males and females tended to adopt different strategies for interacting with the same uncertain environment. The difference in explore-exploit strategies across sexes may provide us insight into potential sex-modulated mechanisms that are implicated in learning under uncertainty. Our major finding that males learned less during exploration and explored for longer is consistent with two explanations

. Future work is needed to understand the neurobiological bases of these observations. One neuromodulator that is implicated in reinforcement learning, including the transition between exploration and exploitation, and is strongly sex-modulated is dopamine ( Beeler et al., 2010; Jenni et al., 2017 ). Studies have shown that dopamine signals regulate exploration via mechanisms of action selection and learning ( Beeler et al., 2010; Frank et al., 2009; Humphries et al., 2012 )

., 2021b ). It is possible that prefrontal cortical dopamine is particularly engaged in implementing explore-exploit strategies via sex-biased mechanisms of learning. Rodent operant testing is frequently used to assess cognitive functions. This is critical for translational work in animals needed to link pharmacology, genetics, and other potential biological contributors to behavior ( Grissom and Reyes, 2019 )

. This was because males were more likely to get ‘stuck’ in extended periods of exploration before committing to a favored choice. On the other hand, females showed elevated reward learning specifically during bouts of exploration, making exploratory trials more informative, which allowed them to start exploiting a favored choice earlier than males

. It is difficult to distinguish from behavior alone whether slower learning drives longer exploration, or vice versa, if being stuck in exploration results in slower learning. Neural measures during explore and exploit choices across sexes may help us differentiate learning signals from signals that drive exploration, and whether these signals are sex-different. Answering these neural questions will require a way to reliably identify latent exploration and exploitation states

. This suggests that sex differences in exploration and exploitation could contribute to sex-linked vulnerability to these conditions, though we do not yet understand how exploration and exploitation differ with sex. Because exploration is a major source of errors in task performance more broadly ( Ebitz et al., 2019; Pisupati et al

. However, a crucial question remained unanswered: what computational differences made the males more exploratory? To address this question, we turned to reinforcement learning ( RL ) modeling to look for individual variability in latent cognitive parameters that could influence exploration and exploitation ( Daw et al., 2006; Ishii et al., 2002; Jepma and Nieuwenhuis, 2011; Pearson et al., 2009 ). RL models include multiple parameters that could influence exploration

. Since males spend more time exploring ( Figure 1E ) and learning from both wins and losses is enhanced during exploration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ), males could lose-shift less frequently than females during both exploration and exploitation, yet still lose-shift exactly as much as females because a greater proportion of their choices were exploratory. To dissociate these possibilities, we next examined the effects of exploration and exploitation

Despite similar performance, response time differences suggested that males and females employed different strategies in this task. One possible difference was sex differences in the level of exploration. Prior research has shown that exploratory choices take longer than exploitative choices ( Ebitz et al., 2019; Ebitz et al., 2018 ). Therefore, perhaps males took longer to make a choice because a greater proportion of their choices were exploratory

., 2009; Humphries et al., 2012 ). However, due to the exclusive use of males in many foundational experiments ( Beeler et al., 2010; Cinotti et al., 2019 ), the fact that dopamine function on decision making is strongly modulated by sex and sex-linked mechanisms is often overlooked. For example, estradiol has been demonstrated to exert both acute and chronic modulatory effects on dopamine release, reuptake, and receptor binding ( Yoest et al

. Males explored more than females and were more likely to ‘get stuck’ in an extended period of exploration before committing to a favored choice. In contrast, females were more likely to show elevated learning during the exploratory period, making exploration more efficient and allowing them to start exploiting a favored choice earlier. Furthermore, the learning rate increased over days in females but stayed stable in males

. 0667; Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ). Critically, there was also a significant three-way interaction between sex, explore/exploit state, and reward ( Figure 4F, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1, sex X reward X state interaction, p = 0. 0438 ). This could imply sex-linked differences in reward learning across exploration and exploitation

. However, sex differences in cognitive task performance can be difficult to detect and even more variable than would be expected given the non-dichotomous, overlapping impacts of sex mechanisms on cognition ( Maney, 2016 ). An underrecognized source of variability in cognitive tasks is that there can be multiple ways to achieve the same level of performance on the primary dependent variables used to assess these tasks, such as ‘number of correct responses’

. e. : they had increased reward learning during exploration ), whereas males learned slower during exploration but compensated for this learning disadvantage by exploring more frequently. These effects were not driven by idiosyncratic strategic differences between the sexes ( e. g. shifting only after two losses ). We used a model-free approach to quantify the extent to which behavior was structured without making strong assumptions about what form this structure should take. This approach allowed us to identify latent variables that define behavior in males and females, even when they performed similarly on the task

The results of HMM and RL models revealed significant sex differences in exploration, paralleled by differences in rate of learning. What remains unclear is how sex, exploreloit states, and reward all interact to influence the animals’ choices. We used a combination of computational approaches to characterize differences in a canonical task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different exploreloit strategies to learn about the environment. We found that males explored more than females and were more likely to get stuck in extended periods of exploration before committing to a choice. In contrast, females were more likely to show learning during exploration, making exploration more efficient and allowing them to exploit a favored choice earlier. Furthermore, learning increased over days in females but stayed in males. Critically, there was a three-way interaction between sex, exploit state, and reward.

    Title: Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase in ER-associated protein degradation
    Abstract: In endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ), membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling on polyubiquitinated substrates. How hydrophobic transmembrane ( TM ) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not known. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 ( Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals ) is a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. A substrate’s TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Their unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction.

   . This system allowed us to mechanistically investigate membrane protein extraction, without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation. We show that Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase. Furthermore, we show how Doa10 cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains.

. It is unclear whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state, if unfolding occurs prior to retrotranslocation, potentially by a separate ER luminal machinery, or if unfolding is directly coupled to retrotranslocation ( Brodsky, 2012; Shi et al., 2019 ). To address these questions, we investigated ERAD mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 from S. cerevisiae. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments ( Kreft et al., 2006 )

., 2018 ). However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that a relatively mildly hydrophobic protein such as Ubc6 retrotranslocates into the cytosol in a Doa10-dependent, but ubiquitination- and Cdc48-independent manner. Speculatively, such a chaperone-stabilized cytoplasmic pool would not be a substrate for proteasomal degradation but rather for chaperone-assisted reinsertion into the ER membrane, and might therefore be difficult to detect

. Multipass transmembrane proteins such as members of the Derlin family ( Der1 and Dfm1 in yeast; Derlin-1, –2 in animals ), Hrd1 and Doa10 have been suggested to act as retrotranslocases for membrane proteins ( Carvalho et al., 2010; Hampton and Sommer, 2012; Lilley and Ploegh, 2004; Neal et al., 2018; Swanson et al., 2001; Ye et al., 2004 ). Another unresolved but linked question regards the folding state of luminal domains during the retrotranslocation process

. This might promote delipidation of TM segments and breaking of helix-helix interactions in multi-spanning membrane proteins. Quality control pathways for membrane proteins that require their extraction from the membrane exist not only in the ER, but also in other organelles. In the Golgi, mitochondria and chloroplasts, membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. These processes are dependent on ubiquitination and Cdc48 ( Heo et al

., 2014 ). Interestingly, in case of the Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc6 homologue Ubc32, and the mammalian Ube2J1, Hrd1 was identified as the ubiquitin ligase involved ( Burr et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016 ). Here, we developed a reconstituted system with purified proteins to investigate the role of Doa10 in membrane protein retrotranslocation

. Thus, Doa10 is a retrotranslocase. Importantly, we also tested if another unrelated multipass membrane protein leads to Ubc6 retrotranslocation by destabilizing the lipid bilayer. To this end, we purified the TFoF1 ATP synthase from Bacillus PS3, which contains 20 TM segments ( Guo et al., 2019 )

. Using a reconstituted system, we disentangled different ERAD subreactions, that is substrate recruitment, ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and membrane extraction. This allowed us to identify two activities of Doa10: retrotranslocase and ubiquitin ligase. The interplay of Doa10 and the Cdc48 complex during the extraction process remains to be further explored. Studies showed that Cdc48 is recruited to the Doa10-complex via Ubx2 ( Neuber et al

., 1998; Hampton et al., 1996; Kikkert et al., 2004; Nadav et al., 2003 ) and Doa10 ( TEB-4/MARCH6 in animals, SUD-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana ) ( Doblas et al., 2013; Hassink et al., 2005; Swanson et al., 2001 ). In higher eukaryotes, a larger variety of ubiquitin ligases plays a role in ERAD ( Olzmann et al., 2013 ). Substrates of ERAD can be soluble luminal proteins, or membrane proteins that either need to be moved across or extracted from the ER membrane

. Next, we tested for membrane extraction of polyubiquitinated Ubc6 by the Cdc48 ATPase. To this end, we immobilized Doa10/Ubc6 liposomes after the ubiquitination reaction, then incubated with Cdc48 and its co-factors Ufd1 and Npl4 ( UN ), and analyzed soluble and membrane-bound fractions ( Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1, A to D ). We observed Cdc48- and ubiquitination-dependent extraction of Ubc6 ( Figure 3A, B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F )

. Our data show that Doa10 does not accommodate a folded domain during retrotranslocation. Instead, unfolding of polypeptide segments on the luminal side of the membrane is a direct consequence of Cdc48 acting on cytoplasmically attached polyubiquitin chains. It is unclear if chaperone-driven retrotranslocation of Ubc6 in the absence of ubiquitination or Cdc48 action also occurs in the cell

. Nucleotide hydrolysis was not required for Ubc6 release and an ATPase deficient mutant ( Get3 D57N ) behaved indistinguishably from wild-type ( WT ) Get3. This suggests that Doa10 allows for passive movement of its substrate Ubc6 out of the membrane. Release of Ubc6 from the liposome membrane involves movement of the TM anchor and the luminally encapsulated C-terminus across the lipid bilayer

The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a major site for protein folding and maturation in the endomembrane system of the eukaryotic cell. A conserved quality control pathway called ER-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) removes misfolded, unassembled and mistargeted proteins from the ER into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome ( Christianson and Ye, 2014; Mehrtash and Hochstrasser, 2019; Ruggiano et al., 2014 ). ERAD thus contributes to protein homeostasis

., 2019; Ruggiano et al., 2016 ). Doa10 works in concert with two ubiquitin conjugating enzymes ( E2 ), the tail-anchored membrane protein Ubc6 and the soluble cytoplasmic protein Ubc7 ( Swanson et al., 2001 ). Ubc7 is anchored to the ER membrane by Cue1 ( Biederer et al., 1997 ). Experiments with soluble cytoplasmic protein fragments showed that Ubc6 and Ubc7 have different roles in the build-up of polyubiquitin chains

., 2018 ). Our experimental system is expandable and can be used to explore how Dfm1, Ubx2 or other factors affect retrotranslocation by Doa10 and Cdc48. How exactly Doa10 facilitates release of proteins from the membrane is unclear. Structural information on Doa10 is necessary to further elucidate its mechanism of action. We speculate that TM segments access a binding site in Doa10 through a lateral gate

., 2010; Ling et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2010 ). Moreover, extraction of membrane proteins also occurs by membrane-bound AAA ATPases that often have not only unfolding, but also proteolytic activity. In mitochondria, Msp1 and the FtsH-related AAA metalloproteases are involved in protein quality control and degradation of misfolded and unassembled mitochondrial proteins. The mechanism of protein extraction by Do10 is distinct from that of M1 and Fts, as Do10 does not have proteolytic activity

Our results show that Do10 is a membrane retrolocase that facilitates the extraction of proteins from the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Do10 cooperates with thedc ATPase C48 in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. The mechanism of Do10 is distinct from that of M and Fts, as Do10 does not have proteolytic activity. Our system can be used to explore how other factors affect retrolocation by Do10 and C48. We speculate that TM segments access a binding site in Do10 through a lateral gate

The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a major site for protein folding and maturation in the endembrane of eukotic cell. A conserved quality pathway called ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) removes misfold, unassembled and mistargeted proteins from ER into cytoplasm where they are degraded by proteas (Christianson and Ye,201; Mehrt and Hochasser,2019; Riano et al,201 ) ER thus contributes protein homeostasis.

    Title: Drosophila hedgehog can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated Ci processing
    Abstract: Extracellular Hedgehog ( Hh ) proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and by activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. We used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor, showing that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. The processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2, likely acting through binding the CORD domain of Ci, or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing.

    Supporting Text:
    Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling proteins guide development and help maintain adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates ( Hui and Angers, 2011; Ingham and McMahon, 2001; Petrova and Joyner, 2014 ). Aberrant Hh protein production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental birth defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb and digit abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal cell carcinoma ( Anderson et al., 2012; Cortes et al

. Moreover, processing-resistant Ci variants were also found to support the development of adults with normal wing patterning, provided a constitutive source of Ci repressor was present to suppress ectopic dpp expression in anterior cells. Thus, Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing

., 2009 ). This Ci variant ( Ci-S3-5 ) supported a normal pattern of Hh target gene induction in wing discs and the development of adults with normal wings. The Ci-155 profile was also very similar to wild-type Ci with robust Hh-stimulated Ci-155 reduction in the posterior part of the AP border

. In third instar larval Drosophila wing discs, Hh is expressed in posterior compartment cells and Ci is expressed only in anterior cells, so that Hh signals to a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior ( AP ) border with declining strength from posterior to anterior ( Blair, 2003; Lawrence and Struhl, 1996 )

. The result shows that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing. Animals lacking both Fu kinase and Su ( fu ) also develop normal wings, although late third instar wing discs do lack anterior En induction ( Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998; Préat, 1992; Zhou and Kalderon, 2011 )

. Measurement of processing through Ci-155 levels and generation of repressor activity from UAS-Ci transgenes in wing discs previously showed that processing was absent only when the zinc finger and CORD domains were both removed ( Zhou and Kalderon, 2010 ). To test whether Cos2-binding domains might be responsible for inhibiting Ci-155 activity we generated ci alleles lacking CDN, CORD or both regions

. At the AP border there was a prominent graded decline of Ci-155 protein from anterior to posterior for those variants fully activated by Hh, providing the clearest image yet of Hh-stimulated effects on Ci-155 levels independent of processing. Remarkably, the pattern and strength of ptc-lacZ and En induction in those wing discs was normal

. The experiments reported here, using Ci variants expressed at physiological levels, revealed a dependence on the Cos2-binding CORD domain for inhibiting Ci-155 activity that is not observed for Ci-155 processing or regulation of processing by Hh. The absence of ectopic anterior ptc-lacZ in wing discs expressing Ci∆CORD ( Figure 7B, D ) suggests that loss of Cos2-CORD association only leads to Ci-155 activity when Ci-155 processing is also inhibited

. The unchanged profile of pathway activity suggests that the profile of pathway-induced Ci-155 reduction is also likely to be the same for wild-type Ci and processing-resistant Ci variants, supporting the validity of using the latter profile to deduce the processing pattern of wild-type Ci-155 ( Figure 2L ). Ci-S849A and Ci-P ( 1-3A ) wing discs expressed dpp ectopically in anterior cells, as expected from the absence of Ci-75 repressor ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B )

. Processing-resistant Ci variants revealed the profiles of Hh-promoted Ci-155 reduction and Ci-155 processing inhibition ( Figure 2K, L and Figure 8 ), and showed that Hh can pattern wing discs and wings normally in the absence of regulated processing

., 2017 ). We therefore developed genomic ci transgenes ( Garcia-Garcia et al., 2017 ) and an efficient CRISPR strategy to directly alter the ci gene itself in order to study the full range of variant Ci activities under strictly physiological conditions. In this study, we examined several processing-resistant Ci variants and found that Ci-155 protein was elevated to uniformly high levels in anterior wing disc cells away from the AP border, confirming inhibition of Ci-155 processing

. Moreover, the greater activity of Ci lacking the CORD domain in pka clones than in cos2 clones shows that Ci-155 activation by loss of PKA activity and loss of Cos2-CORD binding can be additive. In wing discs with no additional alterations, Ci∆CORD, Ci∆CDN, and Ci∆CORD∆CDN all supported a near-normal Ci-155 profile, indicating substantially normal regulation of Ci-155 processing, and strong ptc-lacZ expression confined to the AP border ( Figure 7A–D )

. While the Ci variant may retain some residual Hib binding, our results suggest that the majority of Hh-promoted Ci-155 reduction is through mechanisms other than degradation due to direct binding of Rdx/Hib. The complete absence of Su ( fu ) greatly reduces Ci-155 levels but not ci RNA levels throughout wing discs ( Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998 ), leading to the hypothesis that direct binding of Su ( fu ) to Ci-155 protects Ci-155 from degradation

. There are also differences between Drosophila and mammalian Hh signal transduction but neither pathway is fully understood ( Briscoe and Thérond, 2013; Huangfu and Anderson, 2006; Kong et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2016; Liu, 2019 ). It is therefore important to understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms involved in the pathway in Drosophila which is well suited to precise and detailed genetic tests conducted under physiological conditions

. However, individual target genes have different sensitivities to Ci repressor and activator depending on the arrangement of Ci binding sites and the tonic influence of other transcription factors ( Biehs et al., 2010; Méthot and Basler, 2001; Müller and Basler, 2000; Parker et al., 2011 ). For example, repression by Ci is essential to silence dpp but not ptc or en in anterior cells away from the wing disc AP border

. One indisputable consequence is that Hh-stimulated Ci-155 reduction obscures direct visualization of the pattern of Hh-inhibited Ci-155 processing at the AP border. Ci-155 activator and Ci-75 repressor share the same zinc finger DNA-binding domain and have opposing transcriptional effects, so the concentration of each species is potentially important for all Hh target genes

. Hh signaling depends on a complex set of protein interactions, so it is imperative to investigate mechanisms under conditions of normal stoichiometry of signaling proteins in their normal setting. In flies, Hh alters the interactions among a set of core signaling components to elicit the transcriptional induction and de-repression of Hh target genes through Cubitus Interruptus ( Ci ), the singular transcription factor of the pathway ( Domínguez et al

. Under this arrangement, cells will continue to express high-level Hh target genes only when constantly stimulated. The arrangement also allows for the possibility of modulating pathway activity through both the degree of Fu activation and the rate of supply of Ci-155 that is protected from processing

. That feature diminishes Hh spread through cells with hyper-sensitive signal transduction and increases spread through cells of reduced sensitivity, potentially accommodating limited deficiencies in signal transduction due to the loss of one major mode of Ci activity regulation

. Ci fragments with those alterations showed complete loss of Slimb binding in vitro after phosphorylation by PKA, CK1 and GSK3, while UAS-Ci transgene products with those changes showed no processing in wing discs, judged by a sensitive assay of repressor function in posterior compartment wing disc cells ( Smelkinson and Kalderon, 2006; Smelkinson et al., 2007 ). The activity of these proteins has not previously been measured under physiological conditions

    Provide a **formal summary** of the article in 200-600 words. **Do not include any jargon or technical terms**. 

In a recent study, researchers investigated how a protein called Hedgehog (H) influences the development of wings in fruit flies (Drosophila). They found that H can act as a morphogen (a substance that guides development) in the absence of regulated processing of another protein called Ci. Normally, Ci is processed into two forms: a repressor and activator. However, the researchers created variants of Ci that cannot be processed and found that H can still induce normal development of wings. They also found that two other proteins, Cos2 and PKA, play a role in inhibiting Ci processing.

H is important for development and maintaining tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Abnormal H production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental defects and cancer. The researchers wanted to understand how H works in Dophila, which is well-suited for precise and detailed genetic tests under physiological conditions. They found that Ci can mediate H action in wing discs in the absence of regulated processing. They also found that Ci can be activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos, likely through binding the C domain of Ci or PK, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles in promoting processing.

The study showed that wing patterning by H does not require regulation of level of either repressor or full Ci protein by processing. Animals lacking Fu and Su develop normal wings, although late instar discs lack En induction. Measurement of Ci levels and generation repressor from U-C transgenes in discs showed processing absent when zinc and C domains removed. To test Cos-binding might be responsible for inhibiting Ci activity, they generated alleles lacking CDN, C or regions. At border was a graded of Ci protein from anterior to posterior for variants fully activated by H, providing clearest image of H-stim effects on levels independent.

The study revealed dependence on Cos-binding C domain for inhibiting Ci activity not for Ci processing or regulation by H. Loss of Cos-C association leads to Ci activity when Ci processing inhibited. The profile of pathway suggests same for wild-type and processing Ci-resistant variants, supporting using latter to deduce processing of wild-type. The study found that H can pattern discs and wings normally in absence regulated.

    Title: Calretinin positive neurons form an excitatory amplifier network in the spinal cord dorsal horn
    Abstract: Nociceptive information is relayed through the spinal cord dorsal horn, a critical area in sensory processing. The neuronal circuits in this region that underpin sensory perception must be clarified to better understand how dysfunction can lead to pathological pain. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin ( CR ). We show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. Our results suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target.

   . The results from this study confirm that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemially-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn means they are ideally positioned to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers

. This capacity is clearly demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation. Importantly, however, our work has largely focused on characterizing CR microcircuits and establishing their functional roles in sensory experience by experimental activation using optogenetics. Future work must continue to determine how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing, as we have here using halorhodopsin

. To address this knowledge gap, several groups have recently implicated neurochemically-distinct subpopulations of dorsal horn interneurons with the perception of both acute and chronic pain states ( Duan et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015; Peirs et al., 2015; Petitjean et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019 ). Historically, much of the research effort on spinal circuits has focused on inhibition ( Zeilhofer et al

. Current models for dorsal horn microcircuitry place CR neurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM neurons to activate lamina I projection neurons and initiate pain signalling ( Peirs et al., 2015 ). Our data is compatible with this model since CR-ChR2 photostimulation evoked oEPSCs in dorsal horn neurons, including populations located superficial to the YFP plexus

. Together, these observations extend on the current view of excitatory interneurons in spinal sensory processing, which ascribes a relative limited role of linking low threshold modality ( innocuous ) tactile input to excite more dorsal nociceptive circuitry ( Duan et al., 2014; Peirs and Seal, 2016; Yu et al., 2017 )

., 2007 ). Notably, we have recently shown that most calretinin-expressing ( CR ) neurons in laminae I and II exhibit specific electrophysiological, morphological and neurochemical properties consistent with an excitatory phenotype and respond to noxious peripheral stimulation ( Smith et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016 )

. These features are consistent with CR-ChR2 neurons initiating excitation that converges on projection neurons. Such excitatory relays have been proposed in the dorsal horn as a substrate for allodynia, where low threshold mechanical inputs are transmitted into nociceptive circuits ( Torsney and MacDermott, 2006; Miraucourt et al., 2007; Neumann et al., 2008; Peirs et al., 2015; Boyle et al

. 34 ± 4 s, p=0. 86 ). This outcome is consistent with gating models of spinal sensory processing that highlight the capacity of innocuous tactile input ( such as those activated by nocifensive behavioural responses during photostimulation ) engaging inhibitory pathways that supress nociceptive signalling in the dorsal horn. Local anaesthesia removes this gating, allowing photostimulation evoked nociceptive signalling to continue and prolonging behavioural responses

. While the above data shows CR-ChR2 photostimulation was sufficient to evoke responses consistent with nociceptive pain, this did not confirm necessity of the CR-ChR2 network in sensory-evoked responses. Thus, a photoinhibition approach was also employed by crossing CRCre mice with loxP-flanked-NpHR3YFP mice ( Ai39 ) to generate offspring where halorhodopsin ( NpHR3YFP ) was expressed in CR+ neurons ( CRCre;Ai39 )

., 2015 ). Taken together, these results support the well-established role of inhibitory populations in suppressing spinal nociceptive signaling and suggest the recruitment of some inhibitory CR neurons in our experiments will have had minimal effects on the robust behavioral outcomes attributed to the excitatory CR population

. This response profile is consistent with our previous work showing that CR neurons respond maximally to noxious mechanical stimulation, with some activation also resulting from hindpaw injection of capsaicin ( Smith et al., 2015 ). CR neuron photostimulation responses also resemble reports from two other groups that have applied spinal photostimulation to populations of dorsal horn neurons ( Christensen et al., 2016; Bonin et al., 2016 )

. In summary, the interconnectivity of CR neurons, combined with the postsynaptic circuitry we have identified provides a mechanism to relay low threshold input into nociceptive circuits ( allodynia ), and provide additional excitation during nociceptive processing ( hyperalgesia ) through reverberating patterns of excitation

. This expression pattern was significantly elevated above the CReGFP control group ( S1 p=0. 043, cingulate p=0. 016, insula p=0. 035, and PBN p=0. 023 ). Neuronal activity in these regions is consistent with nociceptive signalling being relayed along the neuroaxis, mirroring the pronounced nocifensive responses observed during in vivo photostimulation

. Likewise, similar arrangements of interconnected neuronal networks have been reported in other CNS regions, albeit typically involving inhibitory populations ( Tamás et al., 2000; Meyer et al., 2002; Woodruff and Sah, 2007 ). This interconnectivity among excitatory interneurons suggests the CR-ChR2 network we have targeted here represents a potent source of excitatory signaling that could amplify afferent input in the dorsal horn

., 2008; Peirs et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019 ), as well as feed forward circuits that supplement excitation during nociceptive processing ( Lu and Perl, 2005; Lu et al., 2013 ). For example, under pathological conditions CR neurons have been reported to receive low-threshold ( Aβ afferent ) input via a population of lamina III neurons that transiently express VGLUT3 and relay this information into nociceptive circuits ( Peirs et al., 2015 )

. 5%;±3. 17 ). These findings demonstrate that CR neurons provide considerable direct input to the lamina I projection neuron population, and when considered alongside the CR-ChR2 network interconnectivity, these have the potential to greatly influence spinal sensory outputs. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies which have reported that CR interneurons activate SOM-expressing interneurons, but not those that express PKCγ ( Peirs et al

. Together, these data rule out the expression of ChR2 in the central terminals of primary afferents arborising in laminae I-III, and support the conclusion that photostimulation of the spinal cord in our in vitro and in vivo experiments selectively recruits central CR neurons and their processes. Channelrhodopsin-2 assisted circuit mapping ( CRACM ) in the CRCre;Ai32 line was used to study the connectivity of CR-ChR2 neurons within dorsal horn microcircuits ( Figure 2A )

Sensory information from the body, including nociception, itch, light touch, and thermal modalities, is first transmitted into the spinal cord dorsal horn, where this afferent input can be modulated, gated and prioritized before being relayed to higher centers for sensory perception ( Todd, 2010; Peirs and Seal, 2016 )

., 2012 ), and a growing number of discrete inhibitory interneuron populations have now been identified as substrates for sensory gating in the spinal cord ( Duan et al., 2014; Petitjean et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Boyle et al., 2019 ). In contrast, our understanding of the role excitatory interneurons play in sensory processing is far less developed

. It is well established that alterations to neuronal circuits within the dorsal horn can directly contribute to neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as persistent itch ( Basbaum et al., 2009; Braz et al. 2010; Peirs et al,2015; Boyle et al. 2019 ), but the mechanisms underlying these changes are not fully understood. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin ( CR ) in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We show that these interne form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain excitatory signaling and relay to lamina projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused conditioned place aversion, and enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halhodops-mediated inhibition of interne elevated sensory thresholds. Our results suggest that dorsal circuits involving excitatory neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify interne as a future analgesic target

The main findings of this study confirm that CR neurons form an excitatory network in the dorsal horn that contributes to pain signaling and amplify signals in the absence of peripheral input. The interconnectivity of this chemically-defined population in the horn means they are positioned to alter incoming information prior to relay to higher centers. This is demonstrated in nocif responses elicited by photostimulation. Importantly, our work has focused on characterizing CRcircuits and their roles in sensory by experimental using optogen. Future must continue to determine how circuits respond during peripherally evoked processing as here using halhodin

To address this gap, several have implicated neurochemically-distinct subpopulations horn with perception both acute and chronic states ( Duan et al,201; Smith et al 2015; Peirs et al 2015; Petitjean et 2015; Boyle et 2019 ) Historically much research on circuits focused inhibition Zeil et

    Title: RAB23 coordinates early osteogenesis by repressing FGF10-pERK1/2 and GLI1
    Abstract: Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated binding protein 23 ( RAB23 ) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in Rab23-/-sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2.

    Supporting Text:
   . Here, we generated RAB23 deficient ( Rab23-/- ) mice that survived until embryonic day ( E ) 18. 5, and this allowed us to investigate how RAB23 regulates bone formation. Similar to Carpenter syndrome patients, RAB23 deficient mice exhibited polysyndactyly and multiple craniosynostoses. We show that disruption of Rab23 leads to an upregulation of Pitx2, Fgf10 and Fgfr1b expression, decreased p38 and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation

. We show that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hh, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling which has the multiple effect of directly regulating osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation and of repressing GLI1. Therefore, RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity, as well as the activation of GLI1

. RAB23 coordinates suture morphogenesis and controls suture patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway, and through the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2. GLI1 contributes in the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche. FGF10-pERK1/2 and also Hh-GLI1 signaling regulate osteoprogenitor cell proliferation.

., 2016 ). These overlapping skeletal phenotypes caused by mutations in FGFRs, Hh regulators and RAB23 are suggestive of common etiological mechanisms. FGF and Hh signaling have well-defined roles during intramembranous osteogenesis. FGF signaling regulates many stages including mesenchymal condensation formation, osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation and activation of the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 ( Debiais et al., 1998; Kim et al

. In addition, Hh signaling was amplified with increased expression of GLI1. During in vitro culture, inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation, corrected the aberrant GLI1 and RUNX2 expressions, and rescued the lambdoid suture fusion. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream regulator of both FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1, and the additional regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2, to coordinate the initiation of osteogenesis.

., 2001; Jenkins et al., 2007; Kalff-Suske et al., 1999; Vortkamp et al., 1991 ). Collectively suggest that craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly are overlapping phenotypes of aberrant FGF and Hh signaling. Aberrant osteogenesis and suture obliteration in the Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J mouse is caused by concomitant derepression of GLI3 and augmentation of IHH which activates the osteogenic master regulatory transcription factor RUNX2 ( Veistinen et al., 2017 )

. FGF10 signaling regulates early osteogenesis: it is expressed in the osteogenic condensation, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several craniosynostotic models ( Twigg and Wilkie, 2015; Veistinen et al., 2009 ). Here, we show that Fgf10, its receptor FGFR1b and the FGF activator Pitx2, are all upregulated in Rab23-deficient calvaria. It is surprising that the FGFR1b splice form, which is normally expressed in epithelia, is upregulated in the mesenchymal suture

. Increased proliferation in the sutures can result in a larger pool of osteoprogenitor cells and enhanced osteogenesis ( Lana-Elola et al., 2007; Rice et al., 2003b ). Taken together, this data shows that RAB23 is needed to repress proliferation in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Our data suggest that Rab23-/- lambdoid suture undergoes fusion through aberrant FGF signaling, specifically by activating pERK1/2 signaling, RUNX2 and enhanced cell proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells

The calvarial suture allows us to study many developmental processes that regulate osteogenesis and skull morphogenesis. Normal development is ensured by the correct temporal and spatial coordination of skeletal patterning, mesenchymal stem cell niche regulation, condensation formation, osteoprogenitor expansion, and osteoblast differentiation and function. In this study, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive into late gestation and they exhibit multiple suture craniosynostosis

., 2012 ) and GLI1-positive cells have been identified in the suture as the main source of mesenchymal stem cells that plays crucial role in suture patency ( Zhao et al., 2015 ). The aim of this study was to determine the role of RAB23 during intramembranous bone development. Previously, it has not been possible to study skeletal development in RAB23 deficient mice due to their early lethality

., 2003 ). In this context, RAB23 might have a direct role in growth factor receptor recycling and turnover, and therefore regulate the availability of the FGF receptors at the cell surface ( Langemeyer et al., 2018; Zerial and McBride, 2001 ). Similar to Carpenter syndrome, several craniosynostosis syndromes caused by mutations in FGFRs are characterized by patients exhibiting syndactyly and occasionally polysyndactyly ( Goos and Mathijssen, 2019; Mantilla-Capacho et al., 2005 )

. FGF signaling has been shown to activate MAPK signaling pathway subtypes pERK and p38 in suture morphogenesis and osteoblast differentiation ( Kyono et al., 2012; Pfaff et al., 2016; Figure 3A ). In Rab23-/- lambdoid suture, we found decreased p38 and elevated pERK1/2 and RUNX2 expressions compare to Wt samples ( Figure 3B–G ). To test whether the upregulation of RUNX2 expression was due to the high levels of FGF10 present in the Rab23-/- lambdoid suture, we isolated E15

., 2017 ). Analysis of early Rab23-/- embryos suggests that RAB23 also has a role in promoting the production of GLI3 repressor ( Eggenschwiler et al., 2006 ). In both Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J and Rab23-/- calvaria elevated Hh signaling results in an upregulation of the transcription factor Gli1, and presumably the mesenchymal stem niche which it labels. Previously, we have shown that FGF10 upregulates Hh and its receptor Patch1 during facial development ( Rice et al., 2004 )

., 2004 ). Here, we show FGF10 upregulates Runx2. Our study revealed that inhibition of pERK1/2 prevented Rab23-/- lambdoid suture fusion by decreasing osteoprogenitor proliferation and GLI1 expression ( Figures 5 and 6 ). We further showed that combined and individual inhibition of GLI1 and pERK1/2 in Rab23-/- calvarial cells downregulated RUNX2 and GLI1 ( Figure 6 ) and that this effect was exaggerated in Rab23-/- cells

., 1998; Kim et al., 1998; Ornitz and Itoh, 2015; Yoon et al., 2014 ). IHH positively regulates osteoprogenitor recruitment to the osteogenic front and GLI transcription factors regulate stem cell maintenance and osteob differentiation. Our data suggest that R23 regulates osteogenesis by repressing F10ER1/2 and H-GL1 and the non-canonical regulation of GL1 through pER1/2.

    Title: Local chromatin environment of a Polycomb target gene instructs its own epigenetic inheritance
    Abstract: Inheritance of gene expression states is fundamental for cells to ‘remember’ past events, such as environmental or developmental cues. The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets. Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states ( cis memory ) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ). By monitoring the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) in the same plants, we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this ‘mixed’ expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis.

    Supporting Text:
   . To address the question of whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLC

., 2010 ). This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation. Since imprinting involves DNA methylation ( Ferguson-Smith, 2011 ), and X-chromosome inactivation involves chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning ( Gendrel et al., 2014 ), it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory. Cis memory has also been implicated in random monoallelic expression

Epigenetic memory can be stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors that are maintained through feedback loops ( trans memory ) ( Novick and Weiner, 1957; Ptashne, 2004; Zacharioudakis et al., 2007 ; Xu et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, memory could be stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes ( cis memory ), in the form of DNA methylation or post-translational modifications of histones ( Moazed, 2011 )

. Having developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FLC expression states at the single-cell level, we returned to the question of cis vs trans epigenetic memory at FLC. We crossed FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. In a trans-based memory, the only possible heritable expression states of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal ( Figure 3A )

. FLC repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation ( Finnegan et al., 2005 ), making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, FLC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure ( Angel et al., 2011 )

. However, studies so far have been limited to genes with naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms ( Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2014 ) or are performed on fixed tissues limiting conclusions regarding heritability ( Gendrel et al., 2014 ). Importantly, a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin

., 2012; Francis et al., 2009 ). These studies provide valuable mechanistic information about how a Polycomb system could store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis. However, to definitively demonstrate that memory is stored in cis, it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus ( Bonasio et al., 2010 )

. Whether heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications is a subject of much debate ( Ptashne, 2007; Kaufman and Rando, 2010; Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011; Petruk et al., 2012; Gaydos et al., 2014 ). Central to this debate is Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), a key transcriptional regulator in animals and plants. PRC2 catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 ( H3K27me ) ( Cao et al

. In a cis-based memory, all four states ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF are possible because the information is stored at the locus itself ( Figure 3B ). As expected, non-vernalized roots showed uniform ON/ON expression of both transgenes in all cells ( Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). To stochastically induce repression of the two FLC transgenes, we exposed F1 plants to 4–6 weeks of cold followed by 7 days growth in warm

. While in both trans and cis memory the chromatin state is inherited, in the former case chromatin responds to the transcriptional state defined by heritable concentrations of the trans-factors, whereas in the latter case it is the local chromatin environment that instructs its own inheritance and is, therefore, the key epigenetic memory element

., 2009 ). Supporting the hypothesis that modified histones are indeed the key inherited cis memory element, it was recently observed that passage of H3K27-methylated histones to daughter chromosomes can occur in the absence of functional PRC2 ( Gaydos et al., 2014 ). Other studies have suggested that Polycomb proteins themselves are maintained locally through DNA replication ( Petruk et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2009 )

., 2001; Crevillen et al., 2014 ). If FLC transcriptional states are defined by concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ), then all copies of FLC within a cell should be in the same transcriptional state. On the other hand, if FLC chromatin states instruct their own inheritance ( cis memory ), then it should be possible for different copies of FLC within a cell to exist in different heritable transcriptional states.

., 2011; De Lucia et al., 2008 ). After cold, H3K27me3 is present at the FLC promoter and gene body but does not spread to neighbouring genes ( Angel et al., 2011; Finnegan and Dennis, 2007; Yang et al., 2014 ). Polycomb-dependent FLC repression is maintained throughout plant development until it is reset during embryogenesis ( Gendall et al., 2001; Crevillen et al., 2014 )

. Strikingly, we observed long files of cells in which one FLC reporter was stably repressed, while the other remained stably activated ( Figure 3D ). In fact, we observed long-term mitotic stability of all four possible combinations: FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). Inheritance of the ‘mixed’ ON/OFF and OFF/ON states directly contradicts trans memory and instead provides direct evidence of a cis-encoded epigenetic state at FLC

., 2002 ) and mutagenesis experiments have shown that K27 is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression ( Pengelly et al., 2013 ). DNA replication poses a significant challenge to histone-modification based memory as patterns of modifications must be faithfully transmitted to daughter DNA strands ( Steffen and Ringrose, 2014 ). During replication, maternal histones are shared between daughter chromosomes where they re-associate close to their original location ( Radman-Livaja et al

. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular changes to the chromatin environment of FLC induced by prolonged cold exposure are sufficient to instruct epigenetic inheritance of the Polycomb-repressed transcriptional state. However, Polycomb complex binding and H3K27me may not be the only factors that constitute this locally encoded epigenetic state. Specific nucleic acid structures ( Klose et al., 2013 ), non-coding RNAs ( Herzog et al

., 2013 ), non-coding RNAs ( Herzog et al., 2014 ) ( for example the chromatin-associated COOLAIR antisense transcripts at FLC ( Csorba et al., 2014 ) ), and histone variants ( Jacob et al., 2014 ) may also play important roles. Thus, not all H3K27-methylated chromatin should be considered as epigenetically silent. What defines a local chromatin environment that instructs its own epigenetic inheritance remains an open question for future research

The study demonstrates that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own epigenetic inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system. This has important implications for our understanding how cells remember past events such as environmental or developmental cues.

    Title: Physiological modulation of BiP activity by trans-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker
    Abstract: DnaK/Hsp70 chaperones form oligomers of poorly understood structure and functional significance. Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response.

    Supporting Text:
   . BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short time scale. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions

. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms ( De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014 ), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client ( oligomerizing ) over other clients, as ( Ca+2 ) ER declines. Regardless of mechanism, one consequence of ( Ca+2 ) ER depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization would be to also shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former

., 2005 ). Such alternative modes may account for the heterogeneity of DnaK oligomers observed by single particle electron microscopy ( Thompson et al., 2012 ). The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the UPR and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP

. Our observations paint a coherent picture whereby enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR ( or its cytoplasmic counterpart, the heat shock response ) but made redundant following resolution of the insult ( Freiden et al

. Exploring the relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones is confounded by powerful feedback that dominates the unfolded protein responses and couples chaperone production to the levels of unfolded protein stress

In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) processes the vast majority of newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion and membrane insertion. The maturation of ER client proteins entails the chaperone assisted folding of nascent chains and assembly of functional complexes. Protein folding homeostasis in the ER requires that the complement of chaperones match closely the burden of nascent chains: too few chaperones risks misfolding and proteotoxicity ( Balch et al

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 08961. 025 Our analysis has been confined to the ER, where the balance between chaperones and clients fluctuates widely according to the physiological state of the cell and is relatively easy to manipulate pharmacologically. But oligomerization can serve as an intrinsic mechanism to inactivate excess Hsp70 in other compartments of the eukaryotic cell and indeed across phyla

., 1992; Thompson et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, activation of parallel chaperones, such as the oxidative stress induced Hsp33 of bacteria, may account for regulated redundancy of the Hsp70/DnaK system, favoring oligomerization through linker engagement in the course of certain stress responses ( Winter and Jakob, 2004 ). The ER is unusual in possessing alternative mechanisms for inactivating its Hsp70 protein, BiP, by covalent modification ( ADP ribosylation ) ( Freiden et al

. 10. 7554/eLife. 08961. 025Figure 12. Schema of the proposed relationships between the different forms of BiP. The monomer ( ‘A’ form ) at the center of the schema binds clients and is shifted to BiP:Substrate complexes by mounting unfolded protein load. With diminishing clients it partitions to inactive oligomers, with whom it exists in equilibrium. This equilibrium is influenced by ER calcium, whose depletion favors the oligomeric form

. However, similar enhancement of linker exposure was also observed in pure preparations of BiP ( Figure 1B ), suggesting that an intrinsic aspect of BiP's biochemistry affords the linker protection under ATP depletion and enhances its exposure upon ATP repletion. DnaK/Hsp70-type chaperones are prone to multimerization ( Freiden et al., 1992; Benaroudj et al., 1995 ), which is enhanced in their ADP-bound state ( King et al., 1995; Schonfeld et al., 1995 )

., 2014 ). Whilst the interrelation of ADP ribosylation and AMPylation remain to be worked out, covalently modified BiP is understood to represent an inactive buffer that can be drawn upon in time of need, by removal of the modifications, thereby increasing the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning

. The asterisks mark the elution peaks of free nucleotides. Note that ATP induced dissociation of oligomeric BiP species. ADP caused partial decrease of oligomers formed by BiPT229A but had almost no effect on wildtype BiP oligomers. ATP-γ-S caused only partial disassembly of wildtype and mutant BiPT229A oligomers, which is consistent with the previously-observed inefficient dissociation of Hsp70:substrate complexes by this ATP analog ( Palleros et al., 1993 )

. In its ADP ribosylated form, BiP is locked into an inactive state with low affinity for its substrates ( Freiden et al., 1992 ). ADP ribosylation affects residues in BiP that interfere with the allosteric coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis in BiP's nucleotide binding domain ( NBD ) to the affinity of its substrate binding domain ( SBD ) for unfolded proteins ( Chambers et al

. In that sense oligomerization would appear to be a common primitive strand of the post-translational UPR, recruiting and inactivating Hsp70 chaperones according to need. This simple, mass action-based mechanism for regulating Hsp70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms, such as oxidation-induced domain unfolding, which may promote alternative modes of oligomerization ( Winter et al., 2005 )

. The model also explains the observation that DnaK oligomers formed in vitro are subject to regulation by the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE ( Thompson et al., 2012 ), as the last protomer ( protomer C, Figure 1C ) is predicted to retain the capacity to respond allosterically to ATP binding to its NDB, initiating oligomer disassembly. Our in vitro experiments provide a crude guide to the stability of BiP oligomers

. Protein folding homeostasis in the ER can be manipulated experimentally by attenuating the supply of newly synthesized proteins through the use of translational inhibitors or by exposing cells to drugs that alter the protein-folding environment in the ER lumen. Exposure of cells to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had a profound effect on the distribution of anti-BiP reactive species in the native gel

. In the absence of ATP, oligomers appear to be remarkably stable with a dissociation K1/2max in the lower micromolar range. In vivo, oligomer assembly and disassembly is likely to be influenced by co-chaperones of the DnaJ family that enhance ATP hydrolysis to promote the high affinity state and exchange factors, such as GRP170 and SIL1, that convert BiP to the low affinity state by exchanging ADP for ATP

., 2012 ), thus targeting the basic chaperoning mechanism used by all Hsp70/DnaK family members ( Mayer and Bukau, 2005 ). A recent study reveals that the same circumstances that promote ADP ribosylation of BiP are also associated with rapidly reversible formation of an ester bond between threonine 366 in the NBD and adenosine monophosphate to yield BiP AMPylation, an inactivation modification ( Ham et al., 2014 )

. Both the defined oligomers and the generalized intra-lane background ( the latter likely reflecting BiP interactions with unfolded client proteins ) are subject to regulation by nucleotides, with ADP favoring the former and ATP the latter ( Figure 2 ). This is consistent with the idea that the ER chaper system is poised to respond to fluctuations in protein load on a rapid timescale by shifting between inactive and active forms of the chaper

The ER chaper system is poised to respond to fluctuations in protein load on a rapid timescale by shifting between inactive and active forms of the chaper. The ER chaper system is poised to respond to fluctuations in protein on a rapid timescale by shifting between inactive and active of the chaper. The ER chaper is poised to respond to fluctuations in protein on a timescale by shifting inactive and active of the chaper The ER is poised to respond to fluctuations in protein on a timescale by shifting inactive and active of the chaper The ER is poised to respond to fluctuations protein on a times by shifting inactive active of the chaper The ER is to respond to fluctuations in protein on times by shifting active of the chaper The ER to respond to fluctuations in protein on times by inactive the chaper The ER respond to fluctuations in protein on times by active the chaper ER to fluctuations in protein on times by the chaper ER in protein on times the by chaper ER times protein on the by chaper ER times the protein by chaper

    Title: The near-atomic cryoEM structure of a flexible filamentous plant virus shows homology of its coat protein with nucleoproteins of animal viruses
    Abstract: Flexible filamentous viruses include economically important plant pathogens. Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein ( CP ) protecting a ( + ) ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3. 9 Å resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ), a representative of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins ( NPs ) from the genus Phlebovirus ( family Bunyaviridae ), a group of enveloped ( - ) ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic ( + ) and ( - ) ssRNA viruses.

   . Surprisingly, we have also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented ( - ) ssRNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) ( Raymond et al., 2012 ) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell ( Huiskonen et al., 2009, Freiberg et al., 2008 )

Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have an enormous impact in agriculture ( Revers and Garcia, 2015 ). Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions ( Kendall et al., 2008 ) and contain several hundreds of copies of a coat protein ( CP ) arranged in a helical fashion protecting a ssRNA of positive polarity, or ( + ) ssRNA ( Kendall et al., 2008 )

. All the high-resolution structures for flexuous filamentous plant viruses correspond to representatives of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ) and include our current data and previously reported structures of PapMV CP ( Yang et al., 2012 ) and BaMV virions ( DiMaio et al., 2015 ). We cannot confirm whether members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses ( Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae and Potyviridae ) have a similar fold in their CPs

Their C-termini are seen in grey color for comparison ( B and D ). PepMV CP, Pepino mosaic virus coat protein; NP, nucleoprotein. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11795. 015 Both potexvirus CPs and phlebovirus NPs have in common that they bind and protect the genomic viral ssRNA

. These viruses infect animals, including humans, are transmitted by arthropod vectors, and pose serious public health concerns. Genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus belong to different superfamilies of RNA viruses when these are classified based on phylogenetic relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( RdRp ) and also have different genomic organizations ( Koonin et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the organization of phlebovirus particles is very different

. Very recently, the cryoEM structure of Bamboo mosaic virus ( BaMV ), another potexvirus, was determined at 5. 6 Å ( DiMaio et al., 2015 ), and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV CP ) ( Yang et al., 2012 ). The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions

. The crystallographic studies with phlebovirus NPs have shown tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligomers, in which each NP interacts with the core of the adjacent subunit via an N-terminal arm ( Zhou et al., 2013 ) following the same side-by-side polymerization mechanism shown in potexviruses. The divergence between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal regions

. In other regards, however, these two groups are different and evolutionary distant, no one would have anticipated the structural homology that we have found. The current work provides data that suggest a horizontal gene transfer event between genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus, or evolutionarily related forms. While potexvirus and the rest of flexible filamentous viruses infect plants, members of the genus Phlebovirus infect animals

., 2015 ). Structural studies of virions by X-ray fiber diffraction and cryoEM have indeed revealed a common architecture for flexible plant viruses. The filaments are 120-130 Å in diameter, and the CPs are arranged following helical symmetry with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn ( Kendall et al., 2008 )

., 2009, Freiberg et al., 2008 ). Despite the divergence of both viral groups, CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses have the same all α-helix fold, and their high similarity suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionary distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.

. They have segmented ( - ) ssRNA associated with the NP in loose RNPs ( Raymond et al., 2012 ), and these are protected inside an icosahedral shell of glycoproteins inserted in a membrane, as has been observed for RVFV ( Huiskonen et al., 2009, Freiberg et al., 2008 ). The topology of CP from potexviruses and of the NP from phleboviruses ( illustrated for RVFV ) are, nonetheless, very similar ( Figures 4A and 4C ) and show a TM-score of 0

. The C-terminus in PepMV CP protrudes from the core domain ( Figure 4B ) and allows longitudinal interactions for helix building. The C-terminus of the phlebovirus NP folds back into the core region and participates in the RNA-binding site that incorporates seven bases/subunit ( Figure 4D ). The location of the C-terminal arm in phlebovirus NPs cannot support a longitudinal assembly, and hence, their RNPs remain more loosely associated ( Raymond et al

. Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ) is another potexvirus which has emerged recently ( Jones et al., 1980 ), progressing from endemic to epidemic in tomato crops causing severe economic losses worldwide ( Hanssen and Thomma, 2010 ). PepMV is transmitted by mechanical contact and virions contain a ( + ) ssRNA of about 6. 4 kb ( Aguilar et al., 2002 ). The PepMV CP is strictly required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus ( Sempere et al., 2011 )

. 95 Å of axial rise/subunit ), which agrees with the 509 nm length originally reported for the virus ( Jones et al., 1980 ). The signal clearly separates the individual nucleotides, but we could not identify the bases due to the helical averaging of the variable sequence of the ssRNA. In order to explore the protein–ssRNA interactions, we modeled a polyU and included a set of four PepMV CP monomers in a molecular dynamics flexible fitting ( MDFF ) simulation ( Trabuco et al

. Some representatives of the family Bunyaviridae, toposviruses, are transmitted by and replicate in arthropods, and infect plants. A similar type of virus could have mediated the transfer of CP/NP genes between distant groups of viruses with different host range. Whether the rest of flexible filamentous plant viruses share these genes remains an open question.

., 2008 ). This overall arrangement is shared by Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV ) a potyvirus ( from the family Potyviridae ), and three different potexviruses ( family Alphaflexiviridae ), Potato virus X ( PVX ), Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV ), and Narcissus mosaic virus ( NMV ) ( Yang et al. 2012, Diio et al. 2015 ) The structure of PVX and PapMV have been solved at 3.9 Å and 5.6 Å resolution, respectively ( Yang et al. 201, Diio et al 2015 )

    Title: Nanoscale binding site localization by molecular distance estimation on native cell surfaces using topological image averaging
    Abstract: Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and the location of an epitope can altogether determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction. Techniques available today for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis. Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Cellular morphology typically varies, and antibodies often bind heterogeneously across a cell surface, making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate native antibody localization. In the present work, we have developed a method, SiteLoc, for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins. Nanometer-scale resolution is achieved through localization in one dimension, namely, the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface. This is done by using topological image averaging. Our results show that this method is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and that it can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well.

   . Fast and efficient screening of epitope locations can be useful for the development of therapeutic mAbs and vaccines. While averaging methods for nanometer-scale localization on microscopy data exist, these do not work for binding sites on proteins with heterogeneous expression on the cellular surface. Moreover, they are designed for identical ( Szymborska et al., 2013; Laine et al., 2015 ) or spherical ( Son et al

., 2012; Nordenfelt and Björck, 2013 ). Knowing the location of the epitope greatly aids both mechanistic understanding and facilitates potential therapeutic development. We have developed a method for imaging-based localization of binding sites on cellular surface proteins with nanometer-scale precision. Super-resolution techniques such as iPALM, STORM, and STED can in practice achieve an ~10 nm resolution but are costly imaging systems that typically require complex sample preparation

Binding site localization is based on resolving the axial distance between bound ligands and a reference surface. This is done by implementing an averaging method on high-resolution images. With this method, nanometer-scale precision is achieved by dimension reduction of surface data within an image plane. A site localization measurement on antibody-coated bacteria is exemplified in Figure 1

In the present work, we have developed an imaging-based method for localization of binding sites with nanometer-scale precision. The location of a binding site is determined by calculating the average distance between the ligand channel and a reference signal channel using the averaged fluorescent signal along a cell contour

. Altogether, we show that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. Site localization measurements that were performed for ligands on bacterial M protein agree well with previously reported data. The antibody Fc binding site on M protein is located at the S region ( Akesson et al., 1994 ), and a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody ( Xolair ) is used for site localization of this binding

The location of protein binding sites on cellular surfaces can have wide-ranging implications for various cellular processes, such as immune signalling, cell adhesion, cell migration, and phagocytosis. Antibody binding to pathogen surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity ( Lu et al., 2018 ), and epitope localization affects diverse immunological outcomes, such as antibody neutralizing ability ( Law et al., 2008; Kwong et al., 2013; Salinas et al

The locations of protein binding sites on cellular surfaces are important for a wide range of cellular processes. In particular, how and where an antibody binds to pathogen surface structures is critical for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. This is especially relevant for bacteria as they are known to target antibodies in many different ways ( Nordenfelt et al., 2012; Nordenfelt and Björck, 2013 )

. Here, an ~10 nm ( ~12 nm IQR, ~9 nm SD ) precision is achieved with diffraction-limited microscopy images by dimension reduction of surface data within an image plane. Existing imaging-based averaging methods are designed for identical or spherical particles and therefore not suited for site localization on native cell surface morphology. This is made possible with our method through normalization of the axial positions of a reference surface

. To assess the performance of the site localization method, we analysed simulated images with variable staining and morphology. These results indicate that a 1 nm precision could be achievable under ideal conditions and show that the site localization method is highly accurate for varying topologies and inhomogeneous surface expression. To test our method in vitro, we measured the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces

. The spatially corresponding data in the antibody channel is processed in the same manner, and the distance between the antibody and WGA signal is resolved through the averaging of multiple acquisitions of the same field of view. Altogether, a relative binding site is determined by resolving the distance between the reference and antibody channel using the cumulative measurement from multiple repeated images

. To assess the performance of this method, we analyse simulated images, demonstrating high accuracy for varying surface expression and morphology. By measuring the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces, we show that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. Our presented results with structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) data achieve an ~10 nm precision certainty

. To explore sources of uncertainty in site localization measurements, additional images were simulated to represent different types of labelling ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). As expected, the uncertainty is larger with secondary antibody labelling than with direct labelling. The site localization uncertainty also increases when the SNR is decreased. These results demonstrate the robustness of the site localization method for varying surface expression and morphology

., 2019 ). Developing therapeutic mAbs against infections may require large-scale screening of highly conserved and functional epitopes ( Martín-Galiano and McConnell, 2019 ). Antibody epitopes are typically identified using crystallography, mutagenesis, or crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry ( Abbott et al., 2014 ). As of today, these methods are costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis

. These results validate that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. Additionally, the results for spherical cells were confirmed using an existing method for site localization on spherical objects, showing good agreement. We have applied our site localization method to determine known binding site locales on M protein that is unevenly expressed on the bacterial surface of S. pyogenes

. We apply the site localization method to determine known binding site locales on M protein that is unevenly expressed on the bacterial surface of Streptococcus pyogenes. Additionally, our method yields viable results when we perform site localization on widefield images with and without deconvolution. To sum up, our site localization method enables rapid determination of binding sites without the need for synthetic modification of cell surface morphology.

. 3 ) nm for the two fibrinogen binding sites. The reported accuracy for site localization measurements on S. pyogenes in relation to number of biological replicates is assessed and presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. To further explore sources of uncertainty in site localization measurements, the antibody binding sites were measured with secondary antibody labelling and compared to direct labelling ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )

. Fluorescently conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) that binds bacterial peptidoglycan is used here for the reference region, and antibodies that bind to bacterial M protein are labelled with another fluorescent dye for imaging in a separate channel ( Figure 1a ). The example shows how our method handles the uneven distribution of M protein on bacterial surfaces ( Figure 1b ). The pipeline for the site localization method is shown in Figure 1b

. The presented results are consistent with the arrangement of the binding sites as reported in the literature ( Akesson et al., 1994; Bahnan et al., 2021; Hauri et al., 2019 ). By performing site localization measurements on widefield images, we show that our method can yield viable results even with conventional microscopy data. Moreover, deconvolution of the widefield images may yield an increase in precision

. Furthermore, our in silico experiments, as well as our in vitro experiments, indicate that the variation in the measurements can be minimized by increasing SNR and minimizing the biological variability, for example, by using directly conjugated antibodies instead of secondary labelling. We believe this method may be useful for rapid screening of epitope locales, and the implementation, written in the open-source language Julia, is provided on GitHub.

. The results, shown in Figure 2, indicate that a high accuracy can be achieved for various cell surface patterns. However, for certain shapes, the method yields a slightly larger distance than the true value ( Figure 2b ). The reported accuracy for site localization measurements on the simulations in relation to number of cells is assessed and presented in Figure 2c

    Researchers have developed a new method, Site, for imaging-based localization of molecular binding sites on cellular surfaces with nanometer precision. The method uses topological averaging of high-resolution images to determine the distance between a bound ligand and a reference. This is achieved by reducing surface data within an image plane, allowing for nan-scale precision. The method is suited for binding sites on native cell morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations. Results show that Site can accurately estimate heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. The method was tested on antibody-coated bacteria and erythrocyte surfaces. The location of binding sites is determined by calculating the average distance between the ligand and reference channel using the fluorescent signal along the cell contour.

    Title: Cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia and the role of peripheral resistance
    Abstract: Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a range of factors: one key element of control is peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. Many aspects of the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance are unclear. An important example of this is the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues, and the effect that response has on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. We show here how hypoxic response via the HIF transcription factors in one large vascular bed, that underlying the skin, influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. We show that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. These data represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia.

    Supporting Text:
   . In this context, we show that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing, in this case in the skin, plays an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response. These data demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia.

. To undertake an analysis of that question, using the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed, we analysed the effect of loss of these hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response. We began with an analysis of the role of HIF-1α. As described above and shown in Figure 1, there is a decrease in skin temperature in mice lacking HIF-1α in keratinocytes

. We chose to use a 10% oxygen challenge for the remainder of our experiments, as this level of hypoxia had the most pronounced ( and thus easily dissected ) phases of response, and yet still showed a return to normoxic cardiovascular parameters over time. As shown above, mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2 and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis show significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals

., 2013 ). Here we show for the first time that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. Hypoxia immediately heightens sympathetic tone in the skin to increase peripheral vascular resistance ( Simmons et al., 2007; Chalmers and Korner, 1966; Kollai, 1983 )

. We have proposed a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin that argues that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO mediated increase in vascular diameter, and resulting increases in perfusion; followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine ( Cowburn et al., 2013 )

., 2011 ). In summary, we present here the first dissection of the murine cardiovascular response to hypoxia, and we present evidence that this response is highly influenced by peripheral vascular responses. This indicates that peripheral tissues, and their vascular beds, form a complex physiological network of oxygen-responsive tissues that influence, and are not just influenced by, central regulators of cardiovascular function

. However, activity of HIF-2α mutant animals recovers substantially between 12–48 hr, although it does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 4I ). These results indicate a complex response of the skin to systemic hypoxia, and also demonstrate that that complexity is mirrored in the effect of those responses on the cardiovascular system

. Infra-red analysis of skin temperature was also used to monitor peripheral vascular perfusion during hypoxic challenge. The initial drop in skin temperature was comparable between K14cre-HIF-1α mutant and littermate control mice, as shown in Figure 3B. As described above, the HIF-1α mutants are essentially hypertensive under normoxic conditions, and this hypertension is exaggerated in the first phase of hypoxic response ( Figure 3C, for statistical analysis see Figure 9B )

. This effect on both systolic and diastolic pressures indicates that changes in the skin affect both traditionally understood changes in peripheral resistance, that is, changes that result in altered diastolic pressures, and other changes that can influence systolic pressures. The effect of hypoxia on the heart rate of the epidermal HIF-2α knockout animals is strikingly altered when compared to the effect on littermate control animals

. Physical activity is greatly reduced in littermate and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia and slowly recovers between 12–48 hr, although it does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 6I ). To determine if the complex shifts in skin temperature, blood pressure and heart rate during hypoxia seen in HIF-2α mutant animals were due to HIF-2α regulation of the arginase pathway, we next analysed mice with Arg1 deletions in keratinocytes

. The heart rates of both HIF-2α mutant and littermate mice converge at this point, and systolic pressure of the HIF-2α mutant drops below that of controls. This suggests a sustained decrease in the vascular resistance of the skin. Epidermal deletion of arginase-1 in this hypoxia acclimation model phenocopied several characteristics of the K14cre-HIF-2α mutant mouse

. The deletion of epidermal NOS2 shows changes in baseline skin temperature ( which is likely correlated with peripheral vascular resistance ) and systemic blood pressures similar to those seen in HIF-2α mutant mice, and initial changes in heart rate similar to those seen in HIF-1α mutant mice

. In animals lacking HIF-2α in the epidermis, adaptation of skin temperatures in the first 12 hr of hypoxia follows the predictions of this model ( Figure 4A ), that is, we see elevated skin temperatures in the HIF-2α mutants relative to littermate control animals. These data are supported by infra-red analysis of skin temperature during short term hypoxia exposure ( Figure 4B )

. In these mice, the onset of 10% environmental hypoxia causes a sharper drop in skin temperatures ( Figure 3A ) than that seen in littermate control animals, and temperatures of the skin in HIF-1α mutants remain well below those of littermate mice in the second phase of hypoxic response; they do not recover until the restoration of normoxia ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9A )

. All of these genes are involved in cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, it is unclear how this cellular adaptation leads to more general tissue-specific adaptations to hypoxia. Even less well understood is how a peripheral tissue response might affect systemic responses to hypoxia

. Physical activity is reduced in littermate control and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia. Activity slowly increases during the acclimation period, but does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 3H ). Overall, loss of HIF-1α in the epidermis appears to delay the cardiovascular changes that occur in response to hypoxia; this is correlated with an increase in peripheral resistance and in heart rates

. Epidermal HIF-1α is shown here to have a direct effect on peripheral vascular resistance and the tonic tensive status of the mouse. The opposite cardiovascular relationship is apparent in the HIF-2α mutant mouse. In the case of the HIF-2α mouse, however, there is a significant increase in heart rate, likely to maintain systolic blood pressure. In this mutant, there appears to be a transition/acclimation checkpoint following 24 hr in hypoxia

., 1969; Weil et al., 1969; Kuwahira et al., 1993; Minson, 2003 ). Keratinocytes in low oxygen release nitric oxide to increase blood flow and thereby improve perfusion ( Cowburn et al., 2013; Pucci et al., 2012 ). Of interest, it has been shown that in both rodents and humans the basal epidermis is hypoxic relative to the underlying dermal tissue, and displays constitutive stabilisation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor- ( HIF ) α proteins ( Cowburn et al

. Given the complex role of HIF-2α in the epidermis, and our hypothesis that this could be determined by the differential effect of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on NO homeostasis, we next analysed the overall levels of NO metabolites induced by hypoxia in specific tissues following hypoxic exposure ( Figure 5 )

. Hypoxia also increases nitric oxide release from keratinocytes to stimulate vasodilation and act as a neuromodulator of sympathetic activity, dampening vasoconstriction ( Ramchandra et al., 2005; Sartori et al., 2005; Hirooka et al., 2011 ). The opposing roles of keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α on nitric oxide synthesis ( Cowburn et al., 2013 ) would suggest divergent effects on sympathetic activity and blood flow in this phase of hypoxia

In this study, we show that HIF-1α and H-2 in the epider play a key role in the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. We demonstrate that HIF-1 and H-2 in the epider have distinct effects on the cardiovascular response to hypia, with H-1 increasing and H-2 decreasing blood pressure and heart rate in the first phase of hypia, and H-2 increasing and H- decreasing heart rate in the second phase of hypia. We also show that H-1 and H-2 in the epider have distinct effects on skin temperature, with H-1 decreasing and H- increasing skin temperature in the first phase hypia, and H- decreasing H increasing skin temperature in the second phase hypia. We also show that H-1 and H- in the epider have distinct effects on activity, with H- decreasing and H increasing activity in the first phase hypia and H- decreasing H increasing activity in the second hypia. We also show that H- and H in the epider have distinct effects on blood pressure, with H- decreasing and H increasing blood pressure in the first hypia and H- decreasing H blood pressure in the second hypia. We also show that H and H in the ep have distinct effects on heart rate, with H decreasing H heart rate in the first hyp and H increasing heart rate in the second hyp. We also show that H and H in the ep have distinct effects on temperature, with H decreasing temperature in the first hyp and increasing temperature in the second.

Researchers have developed a new method for mapping neural circuits with single-neuron resolution by combining temporal focusing two-photon activation of channelrhodops (Ch2) with restriction of Ch2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This approach allows for reliable activation of individual neurons and determination of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. The method overcomes limitations of previous optogenetic methods, such as unintended activation of fibers or axonal boutons, by restricting light-induced responses to the soma and proximal dendrites. Temporal focusing of two-photon excitation enables precise activation of neurons in brain slices for construction of functional connectivity maps with single resolution without loss of information about local connections in the region of the dendritic arbor of the neuron.

The study demonstrates that soma-targeted Ch2 can be combined with techniques for two-ph optical control of neuronal activity previously developed for caged neurotrans or optogen probes. The merit of the optical method depends on axial, temporal precision, and number of neurons to be stimulated in a given paradigm. To separate spontaneous currents from synaptic events, synaptic responses were required on multiple repetitions with post-stimulus jitter less than 14 ms. A lack of connection was defined as failure to reach criteria following presence of GCMPs response light in presynaptic neuron.

The researchers used GCMP-monitored mapping experiments with targeted Ch2 and same stimulation power, detecting putative connections, but frequently coincident with direct responses of stimulation dendritic ar. Variations in single properties of ops can generate action trains or sustained depolarizations, and red-shifted variants enabled excitation deeper tissue and control of distinct populations. Ch2 harboring Kv localization enhanced sensitivity, useful in situations excitation power at premium. The soma-restricted construct significantly enhances ability to map connections single resolution.

The study targeted Ch2 to soma and proximal neurons in somatosensory cortex, added fluorescent tag identify Ch2-express for two-photon focused beam. Combined soma-target Ch2 with verification potential generation genetically encoded indicator mapping protocol. Measured somatic targeting finer, two-ph excitation targeted Ch2 enhanced relative normal Ch under conditions, established utility targeted ops for local maps neural circuits.

    Title: Negative reciprocity, not ordered assembly, underlies the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA
    Abstract: The mode of interaction of transcription factors ( TFs ) on eukaryotic genomes remains a matter of debate. Single-molecule data in living cells for the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 were previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, the quantity that was calculated does not determine binding order but, rather, energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we undertake a rigorous biophysical analysis which leads to the concept of reciprocity. The single-molecule data imply that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, with expression of Sox2 increasing Oct4’s genomic binding but expression of Oct4 decreasing Sox2’s binding. Models show that negative reciprocity can arise either from energy expenditure or from a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. Both possibilities imply unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, for which single-molecule methods provide novel detection capabilities.

    Supporting Text:
   . What we have found in analyzing the sign of the reciprocity is quite different from ordered assembly. Far from Sox2 ‘assisting’ Oct4, the data of Chen et al. may be accounted for, by the genomic-diversity model at thermodynamic equilibrium ( Figure 3A ), if Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome. This finding was unexpected. It is not surprising that TFs like Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit different cooperativities at different loci

. However, by the same token, we may need to know a good deal more about how TFs interact across the genome to properly interpret single-molecule data. The implications of this finding will need to be addressed in future studies. In our view, the most intriguing consequence of our analysis is the tantalizing possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA

. Evidence of mixed cooperativity across the genome or of energy expenditure has not previously been found in living cells and suggests unexpected complexity ‘behind the scenes’ in how Sox2 and Oct4 interact on DNA. The single-molecule methods of Chen et al. offer exciting capabilities for unravelling such mechanisms. Two further considerations are important to the broader context of the work described here

. However, for the variation in sign of that cooperativity across the genome to be relevant has significant ramifications. It tells us that single-molecule data, when coupled to the experimental strategy of Chen et al., provides more information than one might have expected. Indeed, it is remarkable that a single number, Γ=-0. 22, can suggest that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across genomic loci in vivo

. using the genomic-diversity model in Figure 3A. Either there is energy expenditure behind the scenes that maintains loci at which Sox2 and Oct4 bind away from thermodynamic equilibrium or, if not, there is mixed cooperativity across the genome, with Sox2 and Oct4 helping each other through positive cooperativity at some loci and hindering each other through negative cooperativity at other loci.

. Hence, on the basis of this model, but by considering reciprocity rather than ρ, the data of Chen et al. do provide evidence for energy expenditure behind the scenes. But there is a further, more subtle problem. Sox2 and Oct4 bind at many loci in the genome, with widely differing strengths and cooperativities. Figure 1A and the single-locus model derived from it represent some kind of ‘average’ view of the underlying genomic diversity

. The data acquired by Chen et al. show that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, which means, in this case, that the fractional binding of Sox2 ( ie: the proportion of Sox2-binding sites occupied by Sox2 ) decreases when Oct4 is induced but the fractional binding of Oct4 increases when Sox2 is induced

. Given the significance of energy expenditure, it is important to examine further the calculation of R made by Chen et al. This paper is devoted to revisiting their assumptions and reanalysing their data on a rigorous biophysical foundation. In the remainder of this Introduction, we describe in informal language the path that we took and the novel insights that emerged about the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on the genome

., 2014 ). One of their main conclusions was a preferred order of assembly on DNA, with binding of Sox2 followed by Oct4 in approximately 75% of instances ( Figure 1A ). They justified this claim by determining the ratio, ( 1 ) R=K1⁢K3K2⁢K4, where the values of the Ki were obtained directly from their single-molecule data. Chen et al

. ( Figure 3C ). Second, if the model remains at thermodynamic equilibrium but the two types of loci exhibit mixed cooperativity, so that ω1>1, ω2<1 or ω1<1, ω2>1, then the reciprocity can also become negative to the level of the data of Chen et al. ( Figure 3D ). In vitro measurements show mixed cooperativities between Sox2 and Oct4 on a wide range of naked DNA sequences ( Chang et al., 2017 )

. Higher-order cooperativity, through which multiple sites can influence binding at another site, is thought to be necessary to account for information integration in eukaryotic genomes ( Estrada et al., 2016 ) but such quantities have yet to be measured. In the absence of data for higher order effects between Sox2 and Oct4 and in order to keep the calculation manageable, we allow only ‘pairwise’ cooperativity within a single locus, as described by ω

. However, TFs that work in concert are expected to exhibit cooperativity in vivo ( Courey, 2001 ) and in-vitro measurements show that Sox2 and Oct4 have substantial positive cooperativity on canonical binding motifs ( Ng et al., 2012 ). If ω≠1, then κ4/κ1≠1 and κ3/κ2≠1. It follows from Equation 14 that ρ≠1, except for the implausible coincidence in which κ4/κ1=κ3/κ2, which may be discounted

The transcription factors ( TFs ) Sox2 and Oct4 work in concert to specify the earliest lineages in the mammalian embryo ( Pesce and Schöler, 2001; Avilion et al., 2003 ). Chen et al. previously undertook an extensive single-molecule analysis of the dynamics of Sox2 and Oct4 in living cells to determine how these TFs found their cognate sites on DNA ( Chen et al., 2014 )

. The DNA viewpoint model adopted by Chen et al. involves the interplay between two TFs, Sox2 and Oct4 ( Figure 1A ). However, their single-molecule techniques only permit one TF to be observed at a time. They therefore used two cell lines, in each of which one of the TFs was fluorescently labeled and measured while the other TF was inducibly expressed. The quantities κ1, κ2, κ3 and κ4 in Equation 2 were determined from four independent experiments in these two cell lines

. First, if the model is away from thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy expenditure behind the scenes and, second, if the model is at equilibrium but the loci exhibit mixed cooperativities, with one kind of locus being positive and the other kind being negative, so that Sox2 and Oct4 both help and hinder each other in binding across the genome. The available data do not distinguish between these two non-exclusive possibilities, either of which could account for the data of Chen et al

. The experimental strategy of Chen et al., of measuring each TF in turn while inducing the other, can now be seen as a protocol for estimating the reciprocity of any two TFs. Aside from the single-molecule experiments themselves, this protocol involves two stable cell lines each with an inducible expression system. The 3T3 cells were also chosen because they do not express endogenous Sox2 and Oct4

Chen et al. concluded in their paper that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit ordered assembly, with ‘Sox2 engaging the target DNA first, followed by assisted binding of Oct4’ ( Chen et al., 2014 ). As we have seen, this conclusion is not justified by their analysis and the question of binding order remains unresolved

. The analysis undertaken here illustrates the point. The single-locus model ( Figure 2B and C ) predicts that the action of Sox2 and Oct4 requires energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium but the genomic-diversity model ( Figure 3A ) offers a different explanation for the same data. But why stop there? There are many other features that could be included in a model

. But the reciprocity also has a meaningful interpretation in terms of TF binding to DNA. If Γ>0, then either the fractional bindings of both TFs increase with increased expression of the other TF, so that P4/P1>1 and P3/P2>1, or both fractional bindings decrease, so that P4/P1<1 and P3/P2<1. With positive reciprocity, the TFs must influence each other’s fractional binding in the same direction

. The influence of Oct4 on the binding of Sox2 can be measured by comparing the label ratio for Sox2 binding when Oct4 is induced to that when Oct4 is not induced. Similarly, the influence of Sox on the binding of Oct can be measured by comparing the ratio for Oct when Sox is induced to when Sox is not.

    Title: Gustatory-mediated avoidance of bacterial lipopolysaccharides via TRPA1 activation in Drosophila
    Abstract: Detecting pathogens and mounting immune responses upon infection is crucial for animal health. However, these responses come at a high metabolic price ( McKean and Lazzaro, 2011, Kominsky et al., 2010 ), and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. The bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) are important immune system infection cues ( Abbas et al., 2014 ), but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays. We found the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as conserved molecular mechanism.

   . Altogether, these data show that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, we found that control animals, but not dTrpA1-/- mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food, rather than on food contaminated with E

We tested whether TRPA1 mediates gustatory avoidance of LPS in flies

., 2006 ). Blocking neurotransmission in these neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin ( TNT ) abolished avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1B ), indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. 10. 7554/eLife. 13133. 003Figure 1.

., 2014 ). It is conceivable that LPS activates dTRPA1 channels via the same mechanism, but additional experiments are required to verify this. Taken together, our data demonstrate that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals

. The fact that this sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved. Our findings, together with previous evidence of an olfactory-based detection of secondary metabolites of Gram-positive bacteria ( Stensmyr et al

. Furthermore, Gr66a-specific knockdown of dTrpA1 abolished the LPS-induced behavior ( Figure 1D ), and restoration of dTrpA1 expression using either of two different dTrpA1 isoforms ( A and B ) in the entire dTrpA1 pattern or only in Gr66a gustatory neurons of dTrpA11/dTrpA1ins flies rescued the avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1E ). Female flies use gustatory detection of non-volatile compounds via Gr66a neurons to select oviposition sites ( Joseph and Heberlein, 2012 )

. To test whether LPS can be perceived by flies during food ingestion we used a binary food choice assay ( Isono and Morita, 2010 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). We found that control flies displayed significant avoidance towards food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). Because LPS is non-volatile we determined if this avoidance is mediated by gustatory neurons known to detect aversive compounds ( Gr66a ) ( Marella et al., 2006 )

. In a binary oviposition choice assay control females showed preference for control food over food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 2A ). This behavior was lost in dTrpA1-/- flies ( Figure 2A ), upon silencing Gr66a-expressing neurons ( Figure 2B ), and in Gr66a-specific dTrpA1 knockdown flies ( Figure 2C )

., 2013; Meseguer et al., 2014 ). It has been shown that the Gram-negative bacterial wall component LPS induces hygienic grooming in Drosophila, an important behavioral defense against pathogens, via contact chemosensation ( Yanagawa et al., 2014 ). Thus, LPS may represent important sensory cues of food contamination with Gram-negative bacteria

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to the interactions between the immune and nervous systems ( McMahon et al., 2015 ). In particular, there is evidence that sensory neurons can directly detect bacterial components as potentially damaging stimuli, and initiate acute inflammatory and nocifensive responses ( Chiu et al., 2013; Meseguer et al., 2014 )

. Taken together, these data indicate that dTRPA1 channels expressed in the plasma membrane mediate at least part of the Ca2+ influx triggered by stimulation with in Drosophila neurons. Interestingly, as for the experiments with NEM, neither the LPS- nor the AITC-induced responses were fully absent in TrpA1-null neurons. This demonstrates that receptors other than TRPA1 may be also sensitive to these compounds in cultured brain neurons

. However, application of LPS gave varying results ( small responses in 40% ( 2/5 ) of the flies; data not shown ) precluding definitive conclusions. Therefore, in order to further test whether dTRPA1 mediates responses to LPS in vivo we monitored intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the ventral nerve cord of larvae, a preparation that allows better accessibility of chemical stimuli

. In these experiments, LPS-induced responses were significantly less frequent ( 9/32, 28%, P < 10–3, Fisher exact test, Figure 4—figure supplement 3E ) and smaller in amplitude ( P < 10–3, Mann-Whitney U test, Figure 4—figure supplement 3F ) than in control experiments. To confirm these data genetically, we tested the effects of LPS on neurons isolated from dTrpA1-null larvae

. This suggests that dTRPA1 mediates some, though not all, Ca2+ responses of larva brain neurons to these compounds. To verify this indication in other experimental settings we evaluated the responses of cells isolated from brains of wild type larvae using the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura2, and AITC as reference TRPA1 agonist. Application of LPS ( 60 µg/ml ) reversibly stimulated more than 70% ( 39/54 ) of neurons isolated from control larvae ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, E, F )

. We attempted to record neuronal responses in these neurons using flies expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m in Gr66a neurons but Ca2+ imaging access to these neurons proved impossible in our assays. Next, we attempted direct brain stimulation. All preparations ( 5/5 ) responded robustly to the application of the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate ( AITC ) or the classical bitter compound caffeine, indicating that they were healthy

Our findings suggest that flies possess a conserved mechanism to detect bacterial endotoxins via gustatory TR1 activation, which may serve to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The fact that this mechanism exploits dPA suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby channels play a role in L detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the sensory modality involved. Our findings together with evidence of olfactory detection of secondary metabolites Gram-positive bacteria ( Stmy et al.,201 ) highlight the importance of the nervous system in host-pathogen interactions.

    Title: Zinc finger protein Zfp335 is required for the formation of the naïve T cell compartment
    Abstract: The generation of naïve T lymphocytes is critical for immune function yet the mechanisms governing their maturation remain incompletely understood. We have identified a mouse mutant, bloto, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. Zfp335bloto/bloto mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we identify a novel role for Zfp335 as an essential regulator of T cell maturation. By analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, we reveal a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. In line with another recent study ( Yang et al., 2012 ), we have shown that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes

. We identify a set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes and present evidence that decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation.

. 10. 7554/eLife. 03549. 021Figure 8. Ankle2 is a functional target gene of Zfp335 and its dysregulation by Zfp335R1092W contributes to the maturation defect in blt/blt T cells.

( B ) Western blot for Ankle2 protein in wild-type ( +/+ ) and mutant ( b/b ) thymocytes, with actin as loading control

. 5 ( Yang et al., 2012 ). Here, we report that an ENU-induced mutant allele of Zfp335 results in defective accumulation of naïve T cells, largely as a consequence of impaired maturation in SP thymocytes and RTEs. We show that this maturation defect is independent of thymic selection or effects on proliferation, but is associated with reduced viability

. To understand which direct targets of Zfp335 were functionally relevant to the T cell maturation defect in blt/blt mice, we focused our efforts on a set of genes for which we had clear evidence of reduced Zfp335 occupancy and mRNA expression, the most prominent of which was Ankle2 ( ankyrin repeat and LEM domain-containing protein 2 )

. Zfp335 binding to the Ankle2 promoter was effectively abolished in blt/blt thymocytes ( Figure 6A, D ) ; this was accompanied by decreased transcript expression across multiple stages of T cell development ( Figure 8A ) and consequently, a virtual absence of Ankle2 protein ( Figure 8B ). Exogenous expression of Zfp335 significantly increased Ankle2 mRNA levels in blt/blt T cells ( Figure 8C ), providing evidence that Zfp335 is both necessary and sufficient for Ankle2 expression. 10

. It is interesting to note that survival of mature naïve T cells appears to be intact, despite RT-qPCR evidence indicating that a number of Zfp335 target genes found to be downregulated in blt/blt mature SP thymocytes and RTEs ( Ankle2, Cnpy2, Sep15, and Wdr47 ) are similarly downregulated in the total naïve T cell population ( Figure 8A and data not shown )

. We have identified a set of direct targets in thymocytes and provide evidence that Zfp335 occupancy at a small subset of target sites was significantly decreased in mutant T cells. Zfp335 target genes were enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. In addition, we identified a new DNA recognition motif that is bound by Zfp335

. Although our data do not provide support for altered thymic selection being an explanation for the reduced T cell numbers in blt/blt mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selection of some T cell specificities is affected by the Zfp335 mutation and future deep sequencing studies will be needed to fully address this issue

. The poor contribution of Zfp335-overexpressing cells to hematopoietic lineages in BM chimeric mice also hints at a wider role. It may therefore seem remarkable that a mutation in such a ubiquitously expressed gene could produce a defect that appears to be selective for this particular stage of T cell development

. It is possible that the loss of Zfp335 binding to the target sites described in our study may be unique to T lymphocytes, resulting in T cell-specific dysregulation; however, this hypothesis is not favored by preliminary evidence showing that target genes such as Ankle2 were also downregulated in B cells ( data not shown )

. Consistent with the view that Zfp335 drives transcriptional activation, we observed that most target genes with deregulated expression in blt/blt thymocytes tended to be downregulated. However, we have noted exceptions in which some target genes—including Zfp335 itself—were modestly upregulated, suggesting the possibility that Zfp335 may also act as a repressor

. Further investigations will be needed to identify the interaction partners with which Zfp335 cooperates to control gene expression. To conclude, our findings regarding Zfp335R1092W add to other recent work ( Hsu et al., 2011; Landry et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2014 ) to highlight unique gene expression requirements in late stage thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants for the formation of a normal sized naïve T cell compartment

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03549. 011 As described earlier, blt/blt mice have a more severe defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells compared to that of mature SP thymocytes, suggesting that Zfp335R1092W-induced dysregulation extends to events in the periphery following thymic export

. For future studies, it will be important to test whether a null allele has additional consequences for immune regulation beyond the selective T cell maturation effects revealed by the bloto mutation. Genome-wide, we estimate that there are more than 2000 promoter regions containing Zfp335 motif sites

. If we extend this observation to the genome-wide level to assume that Zfp335R1092W-induced transcriptional dysregulation in mature naïve T cells approximates the situation in RTEs, one way to explain why mature T cells are less affected could be that the deregulated genes and their associated pathways are most critical during late-thymic to early post-thymic maturation, after which they become dispensable

. Interestingly, we observed that transduction frequencies for Zfp335WT in DP thymocytes ( Figure 2H ) or non-T lymphocytes ( data not shown ) were typically low ( <10% ) compared to transduction frequencies achieved with Zfp335R1092W or other genes, suggesting that overexpression of Zfp335 may have an inhibitory effect on early hematopoiesis, leading to poorer reconstitution of transduced progenitors

. It is likely that the T cell maturation defect arises from the cumulative effects of relatively small gene expression changes within the Zfp335 regulatory network, possibly resulting in mild perturbations of multiple pathways whose functional consequences may not be individually significant but in combination may negatively impact overall T cell fitness

. Of the ten target genes listed in Figure 6C as having significantly reduced Zfp335R1092W binding, only three ( Ankle2, Nme6, Cnpy2 ) were downregulated in expression by more than twofold ( Figure 6E ). Since our ChIP-seq results were derived from total thymocytes, of which only a small percentage are mature CD4SP, one caveat was that we might have missed gene expression changes in the larger population, so we sorted DP thymocytes ( >90% of total ) and tested them by RT-qPCR

.

    Title: Avoidance of stochastic RNA interactions can be harnessed to control protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea
    Abstract: A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.

    Supporting Text:
   . For 97% of species, we find a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. Furthermore, by generating synonymously variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs, we demonstrate that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled. Our results demonstrate that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes

. This measures a property that we call the ‘extrinsic avoidance‘ of mRNA:ncRNA interactions, yet this approach may fail to identify genuine avoidance in cases when the G+C content differences between interacting RNAs is extreme. Measuring only extrinsic avoidance ( using shuffled mRNAs as negative controls ), we found that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most ( 73% ) of the prokaryotic phyla ( p<0

. Our results clearly establish a signature of selection that acts to minimise stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions. However, with thousands of potential interacting RNA species in even simple prokaryotic systems ( Vivancos et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2010 ), the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely. Therefore, there ought to be a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression

. 7%. Thus, avoidance is at least as good an explanation of variation in protein abundance as either codon usage and internal mRNA secondary structure. Our results indicate that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels. We therefore predict that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled

. It also revealed other statistically significant regions with high correlation correlation coefficient throughout the GFP mRNAs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). We predict that mRNAs with low avoidance values will produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. In order to test this, we conducted a meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data and the relationship between this data and measures of mRNA and ncRNA avoidance

., 2011 ) and core ncRNAs are good candidates to test ncRNA:ncRNA avoidance. In conclusion, our results indicate that the specificity of prokaryotic ncRNAs for target mRNAs is the result of selection both for a functional interaction and against stochastic interactions. Our experimental results support the view that stochastic interactions are selected against, due to deleterious outcomes on expression. We suspect avoidance of crosstalk interactions has several evolutionary consequences

. Applying this knowledge to mRNA design will enable precise control of protein abundance through the incorporation or exclusion of inhibitory interactions with native ncRNAs.

. Finally, taking codon usage, mRNA secondary structure and potential mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account allows better prediction of proteome outputs from genomic data, and informs the precise control of protein levels via manipulation of synonymous mRNA sequences ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5 ).

. This enables the assessment of the impact of synonymous changes on protein abundance using fluorescence. Avoidance and mRNA secondary structure are both significantly correlated with fluorescence, whereas codon usage is not ( Spearman’s rho values are 0. 11 and 0. 65, the corresponding p-values are 3. 17 × 10−41 and 1. 69–20 ) ( Figure 2A ). Note that one of the GFP datasets ( Goodman et al., 2013 ) uses native E

( A ) This heatmap summarizes the effect sizes of four mRNA attributes ( avoidance of mRNA:ncRNA interaction, 5´ end secondary structure, codon bias and mRNA abundance ) on protein expression as Spearman’s correlation coefficients, which are represented in gradient colors, while a starred block shows if the associated correlation is significant ( p<0. 05 )

. First, as transcriptional outputs become more diverse in evolution, we expect that the probability of stochastic interactions for both new ncRNAs and mRNAs becomes higher. This will impact the emergence of new, high abundance RNAs, since selection for high abundance may be mitigated by deleterious crosstalk events

., 2009; Maier et al., 2011; Plotkin and Kudla, 2011; Goodman et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016 ). Here we show that crosstalk interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs also impact protein abundance, and that such interactions have a greater effect than either mRNA secondary structure or codon usage. We measured interactions between a set of evolutionarily conserved core mRNAs and ncRNAs from 1700 prokaryotic genomes using minimum free energy ( MFE ) models

To examine if avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions is a feature of transcriptomes in bacteria and archaea, we estimated the strength of all possible intermolecular RNA interactions using a minimum free energy ( MFE ) model ( Mückstein et al., 2006 ) using core ncRNAs and mRNAs. In this work the core ncRNAs are six well conserved and highly expressed tRNA, rRNA, RNase P RNA, SRP RNA, tmRNA and 6S RNA families annotated by Rfam ( Gardner et al., 2011; Nawrocki et al

. 13479. 008Figure 2—figure supplement 2. The scatter-plots of protein abundances ( as log-fluorescences ) summarize the effect of general factors for extreme GFP and previously published GFP datasets. ( A–C ) Each GFP mRNA was sampled from the extremes of one of three metrics presumed to impact expression mRNA:ncRNA binding, 5´ end secondary structure or codon usage. Slightly darker or lighter colors display the type of extremes. Avoidance correlates with GFP expression ( Rs = 0

. A test of G+C composition revealed a significant difference ( p<0. 05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test ) between mRNAs and ncRNAs for 95% of bacteria and archaea ( Figure 1D, E ). Therefore, either extrinsic or intrinsic avoidance signals indicate that selection against stochastic interactions and it is near-universal for the prokaryotes ( 97% of all strains ) ( Figure 1E and Supplementary file 1A and B )

. 01 and 1. 3 × 10–12 ). In contrast, 5´ end mRNA structure significantly correlates in two datasets, and codon usage significantly correlates in all four datasets. This indicates that, despite strong selection against stochastic interactions, such interactions do significantly impact the proteome ( Figure 2A and Supplementary file 3 ). We have also conducted an ‘outlier analysis’ on one of the E. coli datasets ( Laurent et al., 2010 )

. These models show that avoidance explains more variance on average than secondary structure or codon bias. Up to 70 percent of the variation in GFP expression can be explained by including all the parameters and mRNA abundances ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). CAI metric defines how well mRNAs are optimised for codon bias ( Sharp and Li, 1987 ). The CAI values were determined based on codon distribution patterns acquired from the core protein coding genes of E

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13479. 011 We also test how mRNA:ncRNA crosstalk impacts the translation of transformed mRNAs that have not coevolved with the ncRNA repertoire ( low avoidance mRNAs are rare in native datasets ). We examined two available E. coli-based GFP experimental datasets ( Goodman et al., 2013; Kudla et al., 2009 ), where synonymous mRNAs are generated for a GFP reporter gene

., 2013 ) uses native E. coli mRNA 5´ ends for their constructs, whereas the other GFP dataset ( Kudla et al., 2009 ) is randomly generated. We observe that the influence of avoidance on gene expression for randomly sampled synonymous mRNAs is strong ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ), while endogenous gene expression is limited. Presumably, due to negative selection pruning low avoidance mRNAs from the gene pool ( Figure 2A )

., 2011; Nawrocki et al., 2015 ), we found that mRNAs with low avoidance values produce fewer proteins than mRNAs with high avoidance ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). This is consistent with the idea that mRNAs with low avoidance are less likely to interact with ncRNAs and therefore produce fewer proteins. We also found that GFP levels correlate with avoidance ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ), while cod usage does not ( Spearman rho 0.11, p 3  × 10−41 ). This indicates that avoidance is a better predictor of protein levels than cod usage or secondary structure ( Figure 2A )

    Title: Dynamic neuromuscular remodeling precedes motor-unit loss in a mouse model of ALS
    Abstract: Despite being an early event in ALS, it remains unclear whether the denervation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) is simply the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron. Using in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period, we identify that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37R mice. We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.

    Supporting Text:
    Overall, this detailed in vivo analysis reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NMJ in an animal model of ALS. Our findings highlight a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS ( Arbour et al., 2017; Moloney et al., 2014 ).

. However, the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation ( Gould et al., 2006; Parone et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2007 ) suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation. In ALS, local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling take place very early at the NMJ ( Arbour et al., 2015; De Winter et al., 2006; Jokic et al., 2006; Rocha et al., 2013; Taetzsch et al., 2017; Tremblay et al

., 2017; Pérez-García and Burden, 2012 ). Here, we used longitudinal repeated in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs to directly assess the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. We predict that a MU-dependent mechanism would result in the more or less synchronous degeneration of the whole MU over a brief period, while a contribution of local neuromuscular changes would result in the asynchronous loss of NMJs within a single MU.

., 2016; Fischer et al., 2004; Pun et al., 2006; Tallon et al., 2016; Vinsant et al., 2013 ) and before any significant MN axonal or cell body loss ( Fischer et al., 2004; Vinsant et al., 2013 ). However, whether early NMJ denervation arises from local branch-specific degeneration ( ‘dying-back hypothesis’ ) or is merely the manifestation of a diseased and globally degenerating motor neuron remains ill-defined

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron ( MN ) loss. Loss of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) is a key pathological event in ALS patients ( Fischer et al., 2004; Killian et al., 1994 ) and in animal models of the disease ( Clark et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2004; Frey et al., 2000; Pun et al., 2006; Tallon et al., 2016 ). Denervation of NMJs is observed prior to symptom onset ( Clark et al

. Immunolabeling of all motor axons after the last in vivo session showed that some of these asynchronously lost NMJs had been reinnervated by other MUs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2, N = 4 ), confirming that these vacated postsynaptic sites were not refractory to reinnervation in general

. We next performed imaging in symptomatic SOD1G37R/YFP animals ( all animals at or past disease onset ) to investigate whether the pattern of NMJ denervation in ALS mice was synchronous or asynchronous. Of note, SOD1G37R/YFP mice were phenotypically and histologically indistinguishable from SOD1G37R mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ), showing that YFP expression did not alter the disease course and that YFP-expressing MNs are not more susceptible to the disease

. To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying NMJ dismantlement, we next examined the spatial and temporal relationship between denervation events taking place within a MU. Indeed, local signals emanating from muscle fibers, glial cells or a damaged axonal branch ( e. g. chemorepulsive molecules ( De Winter et al., 2006; Maimon et al., 2018 ) or misfolded proteins ( Ayers et al., 2016; Grad et al

. A number of visualized motor axons and their remaining NMJs were eventually lost in a synchronous manner ( 7/19 MU arbors, 5/11 mice; Figure 3A ) showing that global MU degeneration ultimately occurs. This phenomenon likely reflects an axonal or central event, such as MN death. Importantly, signs of NMJ denervation preceded most of these MU degenerations ( Figure 3B, 6/7 MU arbors )

., 2013; Taetzsch et al., 2017; Tremblay et al., 2017 ), implying that local, MU-independent, structural changes could occur. Finally, ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease where cell types other than motor neurons contribute to the disease pathogenesis ( Boillée et al., 2006a; Ilieva et al., 2009 ). Contribution of various cell types known to interact with NMJs and motor axons has been suggested ( Arbour et al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2009; Keller et al., 2009; Lobsiger et al

., 2016; Grad et al., 2014 ) could potentially propagate through the extracellular space and contribute to NMJ loss in ALS. If such local signals in the neuromuscular environment influence NMJ dismantlement, one would predict that these events may tend to propagate from one or several focal points

., 1971; Schmied et al., 1999 ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the loss of NMJs within a single MU is a dichotomous and mostly synchronous event and that local synaptic events have a limited impact on the denervation process. Under this monotonic paradigm, degenerating MUs are irrevocably caught in a degenerative cascade while surviving MUs attempt to compensate, consequently undermining the relevance of the NMJ as a disease-modifying therapeutic target

. There is considerable evidence which suggests that a subset of degenerating motor-units ( MU, a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates ) swiftly lose their NMJs while a distinct, yet unaffected, population compensates via axonal sprouting ( Pun et al., 2006; Schaefer et al., 2005 ), somewhat akin to a nerve injury. Indeed, NMJs innervated by fast-fatigable MNs are lost early, followed by fast-fatigue resistant and slow MNs ( Frey et al., 2000; Pun et al., 2006 )

. NMJs were classified based on their innervation status over time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We first confirmed that the same MU arbor and its NMJs were reliably imaged over several weeks without inducing any structural damage. We followed single MUs in WT/YFP animals and found that YFP-labeled axons stayed precisely overlapped with nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites over all imaging sessions performed ( 36/36 NMJs, 5/5 MU arbors, N = 5; Figure 1C )

. We found that YFP-labeled nerve terminals gradually retracted from some nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites ( Figure 2A–C, for example, NMJ A1, A3, A4 ) while other axonal branches remained perfectly overlapped ( e. g. NMJ A2 ). Some NMJs were even re-innervated by the MU ( Figure 2A, A4 inset, arrowhead, see below for more details ) further suggesting that the MU arborization was not globally degenerating at this stage

. Importantly, very few changes in axonal branching pattern, postsynaptic nAChRs and presynaptic nerve terminal organization were observed. Consistent with previous reports ( Balice-Gordon and Lichtman, 1990; Li et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2005; Turney et al., 2012 ), our results show that NMJs of WT mice remained innervated by the same MU and were very stable over long periods of time

., 2009; Keller et al., 2009; Lobsiger et al.,2016; Grad et al. 2014 ) could propagate through the extracellular space and contribute to NMJ loss in ALS. If local signals in the neuromus environment influence NM dismantlement, would predict that events tend to propagate from one or several focal points. We found that NM denervation events tended to propagate from the first lost NMJ ( Figure 5 ) consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor, distal branches being more susceptible.

    Title: Estrogen receptor alpha in the brain mediates tamoxifen-induced changes in physiology in mice
    Abstract: Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cells that mediate these negative side effects are unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area ( hypothalamus-POA ). These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ), as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Accordingly, ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice.

    Supporting Text:
   . Finally, we show that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the tamoxifen-induced chances in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA and the effects on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. Together, these findings suggest that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health

. Given the known roles of ERα in mediating many aspects of physiology, as well as the effect of ERα conditional knockout on the transcriptomic effects of tamoxifen, we asked if loss of ERα would also affect physiological responses to tamoxifen in mice. We therefore measured body temperature, movement, and bone density in Esr1 cKO mice treated equivalently and concurrently with wild-type animals ( Figure 1A )

., 1985; Takeo and Sakuma, 1995 ). Although ERβ also is expressed in the hypothalamus-POA, physical activity is primarily regulated by ERα signaling in mice ( Ogawa et al., 2003 ). Therefore, tamoxifen may act as an ERα antagonist in those estrogen-sensitive regions to suppress physical activity in mice. Similar to endogenous estrogens, tamoxifen has profound effects on bone remodeling

., 2004; Gofflot et al., 2007; Matsuda et al., 2013; Saito et al., 2016 ). Here, we take the first steps to define the cell types and cellular mechanisms that mediate some of the undesirable side effects experienced by people undergoing tamoxifen therapy. We demonstrate the utility of mice as a good model to study many of tamoxifen’s physiological effects; tamoxifen administration in mice increases heat dissipation, decreases movement, and increases bone density

., 2019; Scalzo et al., 2020 ). Together, these studies reveal widespread effects of tamoxifen treatment on the hypothalamus-POA and implicate ERα signaling within the Nkx2-1 lineage as a major mediator of the effects of tamoxifen on thermoregulation, movement, and bone homeostasis. In summary, the rodent model of tamoxifen treatment provided here mimics several of the key side effects of endocrine therapy observed in humans

. 109, p=0. 1013 ) ( Figure 6C–D ) and BAT temperature ( t = 0. 2640, df = 4, p=0. 8048 ) ( Figure 6E–F ). In contrast to wild-type mice, there was no significant difference in movement between tamoxifen and vehicle treatment in Esr1 cKO mice ( treatment: F ( 1, 14 ) =2. 638, p=0. 1266 ) ( Figure 6G–H ). Knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA largely blocked the effect of tamoxifen on bone physiology as well. No difference was observed in bone volume fraction ( t = 0

., 2011 ). In female breast cancer patients, there is a significant association between ongoing tamoxifen usage and symptoms of fatigue ( Haghighat et al., 2003 ). Our results demonstrate that ERα in the hypothalamus-POA mediates a suppressive effect of tamoxifen on movement. This is consistent with the results that ERα signaling in the hypothalamus-POA regulates physical activity in mice ( Ogawa et al., 2003; Musatov et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011; Sano et al., 2013; Correa et al

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that exerts antiproliferative effects on cancer cells through ERα ( Davies et al., 2011 ), but can exert agonistic or antagonistic effects on the different estrogen receptors depending on cell type and context ( Watanabe et al., 1997; Mo et al., 2013 ). The hypothalamus-POA is rich in estrogen receptor expression, making it a prime candidate as a tamoxifen target ( Merchenthaler et al., 2004; Gofflot et al., 2007; Matsuda et al

., 2014 ). Nevertheless, conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA blocked the majority of the physiological changes observed in wild-type mice by tamoxifen, indicating a pivotal role of ERα in mediating the homeostatic effects of tamoxifen. Together, these data indicate an indispensable role for ERα in the molecular and physiological response to tamoxifen treatment in mice

., 2016; Sá et al., 2016 ). We hypothesized that tamoxifen alters estrogen receptor signaling in the hypothalamus-POA to mediate key negative side effects of tamoxifen therapy. To test this hypothesis, we modeled tamoxifen treatment in mice with a 28-day treatment course based on human dosage ( Slee et al., 1988 ) and asked if mice experience physiological effects similar to humans

. If translatable to humans, our findings suggest the hypothesis that tamoxifen treatment may alter thermoregulation, physical activity, and bone through ERα signaling in the brain. A recent survey conducted in the online breast cancer communities showed that women often experienced more of tamoxifen’s side effects than men and one-third of patients did not feel that their side effects were taken seriously ( Berkowitz et al., 2021 )

. 5643 ) or cortical thickness ( t = 0. 9720, df = 10, p=0. 3540 ) in the cortical bones of mice treated with tamoxifen compared to mice treated with vehicle ( Figure 6I and K ). Taken together, these results suggest that the dysregulation of core temperature, reduced movement, and changed bone physiology associated with tamoxifen treatment in wild-type mice are largely dependent upon the expression of ERα in the Nkx2-1 lineage.

., 2015 ). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that tamoxifen alters transcriptomes in the hypothalamus-POA, consistent with the hypothesis that tamoxifen treatment alters central nervous system function ( Eberling et al., 2004; Gibbs et al., 2014; Denk et al., 2015 ). Indeed, tamoxifen and its metabolites are detectable and up to 46-fold higher in the brain than in serum of breast cancer patients ( Lien et al., 1991 )

. 296, df = 42, p=0. 006 ) ( Figure 2D and E ). Tamoxifen-treated mice did not show significant changes in body weight compared to control mice, over 28 days of treatment ( treatment: p=0. 5468 ) ( Figure 2F and G ). To ask how tamoxifen affects gene expression in different cell types, we collected hypothalamus-POA ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) after 28 daily injections of tamoxifen or vehicle and analyzed individual cells by drop-Seq ( Macosko et al., 2015 )

. We measured movement, bone density, and the temperature of the body core, tail skin, and thermogenic brown adipose tissue ( BAT ). Profiling genome-wide expression changes of individual cells in the hypothalamus-POA using Drop-seq, a droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing technology, revealed transcriptional changes induced by tamoxifen in multiple cell types

., 2010 ). However, depletion of ERα in the medial basal hypothalamus or specifically within the KNDy neurons results in an impressive increase in bone mass ( Farman et al., 2016; Herber et al., 2019 ), suggesting that the strongest effects of estrogens on bone may be mediated by hypothalamic ERα. The potent effect of hypothalamic ERα on bone is consistent with our finding that conditional ERα ablation in the hypothalamus-POA can abrogate the effects of tamoxifen on bone density. Our results suggest that ERα in the hypothalam-PO mediates the effects of tamox on thermoregulation, movement, and bone homeostasis in mice.

    Title: ISG15 counteracts Listeria monocytogenes infection
    Abstract: ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated, linear di-ubiquitin-like protein, with anti-viral activity. The role of ISG15 during bacterial infection remains elusive. We show that ISG15 expression in nonphagocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection. Surprisingly this induction can be type I interferon independent and depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. Most importantly, we observed that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. We made use of stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ) to identify ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for the protective effect. Strikingly, infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins, which correlates with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Together, our data reveal a previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection, reinforcing the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response.

   . Here, we show that in nonphagocytic cells ISG15 is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection and that, surprisingly, early induction can be type I interferon independent. Listeria-mediated ISG15 induction depends on the CSP, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Most importantly, we demonstrate that ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo

. Collectively, our data reveal that during Listeria infection ISG15 modification of distinct ER and Golgi proteins increases secretion of cytokines which are known to counteract infection in vivo.

. Taken together, our results show that ISG15 can be induced by Listeria in an interferon-independent manner in human nonphagocytic cells. We thus sought to determine how ISG15 was induced and what consequences ISG15 expression had on the cell and on infection

. This phenotype mirrors the bacterial burden of Isg15−/− MEFs, clearly indicating that ISG15's role in host defense against Listeria in vitro requires ISGylation ( Figure 3I ). Since ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is known to be covalently linked to hundreds of cellular and several viral substrates ( Giannakopoulos et al., 2005; Zhao et al

. Interestingly, we found that the two transcripts are concomitantly induced after 3 hr of infection with Listeria ( Figure 1D, E ). This concomitant induction led us to hypothesize that ISG15 could be induced in an interferon-independent manner during Listeria infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we used the viral protein B18R to block signaling from the interferon receptor ( Chairatvit et al., 2012 ). The protein acts similarly to a blocking antibody

., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005 ). Since Listeria, as other pathogenic bacteria, often targets post-translational modifications during infection ( Bonazzi et al., 2008; Ribet and Cossart, 2010; Ribet et al., 2010 ), we were interested in investigating the interplay between the interferon-stimulated ubl ISG15 and Listeria. ISG15 plays an important role in the innate immune response to viruses

., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005 ), our goal was to identify which substrates following overexpression of ISG15 could account for the protective effect detected in the context of Listeria infection and used a proteomic approach. We made use of SILAC coupled with LC-MS/MS and compared cells that express empty vector, cells that express ISG15 and cells that express ISG15 that were treated with interferon, the primary inducer of ISGylation ( Figure 4A, B )

., 2007 ). ISG15 seems to be unique among ubls, as it can both modify specific target proteins and non-specifically modify proteins cotranslationally ( Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Durfee et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010 ). Since ISG15 is strongly induced by type I interferon, which is produced during bacterial infection, we aimed to decipher whether ISG15 is induced during Listeria infection and if so whether ISGylation acts as a means of host defense against invading bacteria

. Furthermore, we assessed cytokine secretion in transformed MEFs that lack ISG15, relative to their wild type counterparts following Listeria infection. Despite significantly higher levels of bacteria in the Isg15−/− MEFs, the cells secreted significantly less IL-6 than wild-type cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E ). Therefore, ISG15 appears to be a critical modulator of cytokine secretion following Listeria infection

. To determine which signaling pathway was responsible for the Listeria-induced ISG15 transcript and to help identify the cellular compartment in which bacteria are sensed, we made use of Listeria strains that are impaired at different stages of infection. Incubation of cells with L. innocua, a non-pathogenic Listeria species which cannot invade cells, did not induce ISG15 induction, demonstrating that external pathogen recognition receptors were not involved ( Figure 2A )

. It is still an open question whether specific ISGs can contribute to a functional antibacterial state similar to an antiviral state. We hypothesized that the massive induction of ISG15 following Listeria infection must have a phenotypic effect on host cells. Indeed, we have demonstrated that ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo

. Increased cytokine secretion mediated by ISG15 is a previously uncharacterized way for the host to engage the immune system to combat both bacterial and viral infection; the first cells that encounter Listeria, ( i. e., nonphagocytic cells ) which are able to induce ISG15 at early time points could raise the alarm against an invading pathogen and as a result help alert innate immune cells to the site of infection

. Collectively, these data implicate that the CSP can directly induce ISG15 after sensing of bacterial DNA in the cytosol of cells in a pathway that requires STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. We next assessed whether ISG15 has a functional effect on infection. We created a retroviral construct that expresses an epitope-tagged version of ISG15 ( 3XFlag-6His-ISG15 ). We then infected cells that stably express 3XFlag-6His-ISG15 with Listeria

. ISG15 protein levels increased relatively rapidly; the unconjugated protein was already present at 6 hr post infection and accumulated steadily throughout the infection ( Figure 1B ). We next investigated whether ISG15 induction following Listeria infection also occurs in vivo

., 1989 ). The U5A clone lacks a functional IFNAR2 receptor ( IFNAR2−/− ) and thus is impaired in type I interferon receptor signaling ( Lutfalla et al., 1995 ). 2fTGH and U5A cells were both highly permissive to Listeria infection ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Strikingly in the U5A cells ( defective for type I interferon binding and signaling ), as in 2fTGH cells, there is still a robust ISG15 response to Listeria infection ( Figure 1G )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 06848. 010 Since ISG15 can mediate its protective effect through conjugation-dependent or conjugation-independent mechanisms, we wanted to determine if conjugation contributed to ISG15's role in defense against Listeria. Therefore, we initially assessed whether Listeria could induce the enzymes required for ISGylation. To this end, we performed RNASeq of Lovo cells infected with Listeria for 24 hr compared to uninfected cells

To test whether ISG15 and ISGylation are induced upon bacterial infection, we infected HeLa cells with Listeria. Upon L. monocytogenes infection, ISG15 was massively induced, whereas incubation with the related non-pathogenic bacterium, Listeria innocua, did not lead to an increase in ISG15 production ( Figure 1A ). We subsequently monitored ISG15 expression in cells infected with Listeria over time

. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ISG15 restricts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo. 10. 7554/eLife. 06848. 008Figure 3. ISG15 protects against Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. ( A ) Percentage of bacteria inside HeLa cells, infected at an MOI of 25, which were transduced with empty vector ( Control ) or stably express ISG15 after 3 hr of infection; CFUs of bacteria within control cells were normalized to 100%, data shown is AVG ± SEM

. In particular, we show that IS15 can be induced by Lister in an interferon-independent manner in human nonphocytic cells. We sought to determine how IS15 was induced and what the consequences of IS15 expression on the cell and infection. This mirrors the phenotype of Isg−/− MEFs, clearly indicating that IS15's role in defense against Lister in vitro requires ISylation ( Figure 3 ). Since IS15 is a ubiquitin-like that is covalently linked to hundreds of cellular and viral substrates ( Giakopoulos et al.,2005; Zhao et al.2005 ), we were interested in the interplay between IS15 and Lister. IS plays a role in the innate response to viruses ( Giak et al.2005; Zhao et.5 ) our goal was to identify substrates overexpression of IS15 could account for the effect in the context Lister infection using a proteomic approach. We used SIL coupled with LC-MS and compared cells that express vector, that express IS15 and that express IS15 were treated with the inducer of ISylation ( Figure 4, B ) IS15 to unique among ub, as can modify specific proteins and non-specific proteins cotranslationally ( Fri-Steli et2007; Dur et2010; Zhao2010 ) Since IS15 is induced type interfer, which produced during infection we aimed to decipher IS15 during Lister infection and if ISylation as means host against bacteria. Furthermore, we assessed secretion in MEF that lack IS15 relative wild-type following Lister infection Despite higher levels bacteria Isg−− MEF, secreted less IL6 than wild-type ( Figure—supplement ) IS appears critical modulator cytokine following Lister infection To determine pathway responsible Lister-induced IS transcript and identify cellular which bacteria sensed we use Lister strains impaired different stages infection Incubation with L innoc, non-path Lister species cannot cells did not IS induction demonstrating external pathogen receptors ( Figure ) still question whether IS contribute antibacterial functional antiv state hypothesized massive IS following Lister must phenotypic host Indeed demonstrated IS counter Lister both vitro vivo Increased secretion mediated IS previously uncharacter way host engage immune combat both bacterial viral first cells encounter Lister nonphoc which able induce IS early points raise alarm path and alert immune site infection Collect data implicate CSP directly IS after sensing bacterial cytosol pathway requires STING TB1 IR3 IR7 assessed IS has functional infection created retroiral expresses epit-tagged IS15 3Flag6-IS15 infected cells stably 3Flag-IS15 Lister IS protein rapidly unconjugated already post accumulated throughout Figure investigated IS following Lister also vivo U5 clone functional IFAR receptor IFAR−− impaired type interfer signaling Lutf199 U5 cells permissive Lister Figure supplement IS still robust response Lister infection

The final answer is: 

IS15 is an interferon-stimulated, diubiquitin-like protein with anti-viral activity. The role of IS15 during bacterial infection remains elusive. We show that IS15 in nonphocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Lister infection. Surprisingly, this induction can be type I interferon independent and depends on cytosolic surveillance, which senses bacterial and through STING, TB1, IR3, and IR7. Most importantly, we observed that IS15 restricts Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. We used stable isotope labeling in culture (SILC) to identify ISylated proteins responsible for the protective effect. Strikingly, infection overexpression of IS15 leads to ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins, which correlates with secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Together, our data reveal a previously uncharacterized IS15-dependent restriction of Lister infection, reinforcing the view that IS15 is a key component of the immune response.
Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smRET) is a method used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the development of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated methods to analyze the produced data. DeepRET, an open-source software based on deep learning, is presented, requiring only human intervention from raw images to histograms of biomolecule behavior is user-adjustable threshold. Integrating features of smRET, DeepRET outputs common kinetic metrics. Its accuracy on ground truth data reached >95% outperforming human and commonly used threshold, requiring ~1% of time. Its rapid operation on data demonstrates DeepRET's capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmark smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET is an all-inclusive software with pre-trained DNN core for rapid, objective, and assessment of smRET for quantifying biomolecular dynamics. The automated software operates with minimal human intervention and requires threshold on data quality as initial, to detailed quantification of structural from images. DeepRET comes as free-use executable for Windows and Mac users, allowing end-users with limited skills to operate. Learning has advantages over approaches: recognizes patterns and features from raw data, allowing implementation routines without preprocessing or empirically rules, and reproducible evaluation of single-molecule; faster than human for large-datasets; comes to.

DeepRET is trained and tested on 2ALEX and non-ALEX smRET data. Other techniques such as 3- and 4FRET can be implemented through additional training. A script version in Python enables experts adjust pipeline analysis for needs. RET is expected to take advantage of smRET data and reference setting bar for data performance, offering benchmarking field structural biology. RET's network is trained for smRET but approach can be extended to single-m trajectories, turnovers, constant measurements, and blinking molecules.

RET was compared to existing software for smRET, SMS, SPAN, ebRET, and HAM. Use of threshold and minimal expertise by RET may be crucial for scientists to take advantage of tool. A standalone executable with instructions is provided for operation by non-experts. Single-mRET with TIR is a method to study biomolecules and provide dynamic in biology. The simulation in RET is based on assumption protein dynamics follows Mark process. Any data can be simulated using implemented trace to meet requirements. This includes noise levels above 0.3, transition probabilities larger single-molecule; comes to human performance and increased when size constituting case for datasets from single-m data.

    Title: Interactions with RNA direct the Polycomb group protein SCML2 to chromatin where it represses target genes
    Abstract: Polycomb repressive complex-1 ( PRC1 ) is essential for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region ( RBR ). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1.

    Supporting Text:
   . We also report that, at a subset of genes, SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets will help shed new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation and on the combinatorial factors that drive the specificity of the diverse PcG complexes in different cellular contexts.

. In addition, our results show that RNA binding also plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin. In Drosophila, the interaction of SCM and PRC1 relies on the C-terminal SPM domain ( Peterson et al., 2004 ) and our results show that a similar mechanism is conserved in humans

. Our data support a model in which the RBR contributes to the localization of SCML2A to chromatin, where it interacts with PRC1 and creates a chromatin environment that is refractory to transcription. Because SCM is a PcG protein and binds to at least one PcG target in Drosophila ( Wang et al

. We have identified a novel RBR in SCML2 that contributes to its chromatin localization. Along with the recognition of methylated lysines by the MBT domain, the RNA-binding activity of the RBR is required to recruit or stabilize SCML2 on chromatin. We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1

. From this set of experiments, we conclude that SCML2 is recruited to a subset of target genes through a process that requires its RNA-binding activity and that the presence of mutant SCML2AΔRBR that is not chromatin-bound causes a partial release of BMI1 and, presumably, PRC1 from chromatin. Given that SCML2 binds RNA through an RBR that is required for proper genome-wide targeting and downstream recruitment of PRC1, we sought to identify the ncRNAs bound to SCML2 in vivo

., 2007 ). In fact, the MBT domain of SCM in Drosophila is important for repression ( Grimm et al., 2007 ), and our results show that the MBT domain contributes to the chromatin localization of SCML2 ( Figure 3D ). In vitro binding assays and domain mapping experiments revealed the existence of a previously unknown RBR within SCML2

. Given that increasing evidence points to a role for noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) in mediating recruitment of chromatin complexes ( Koziol and Rinn, 2010; Wang and Chang, 2011 ) and that at least one ncRNA has been shown to make contact with PRC1 ( Yap et al., 2010 ), we hypothesized that an RNA-binding chromatin protein may be involved in PRC1 recruitment in mammals. The potential role of SCM and its mammalian homologs in the regulation of PRC1 and function remain unexplored

. Consistent with this observation, both the MBT domains and the SPM domain contribute to the repressive activity of SCM in Drosophila ( Roseman et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2004; Grimm et al., 2007 ). These results show that RNA binding and the interaction with PRC1 are independent events and that they require different protein regions ( the RBR and SPM domain, respectively )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02637. 016 Given that SCML2A can recruit BMI1, and therefore PRC1, to an artificial reporter and that PRC1 is generally thought as the effector of Polycomb-mediated repression ( Simon and Kingston, 2009 ), we hypothesized that the changes in transcriptional activity observed above might be secondary to a loss of BMI1 from SCML2-bound genes. Unexpectedly, this was not the case

. Here, we have unveiled two mechanisms by which SCML2A contributes to PRC1 function: ( 1 ) SCML2 and PRC1 cooperate in chromatin binding, as evidenced by loss of BMI1 upon overexpression of SCML2AΔRBR, recruitment of BMI1 by SCML2A at artificial tethering sites, and the weak association of SCML2B to chromatin; and ( 2 ) SCML2 enforces repression at some target sites independent of the presence of PRC1

. Together, these results show that the affinity of SCML2 for chromatin is regulated by multiple molecular mechanisms, including binding to PRC1 via the SPM domain, histone marks via the MBT domains, and RNA via the RBR. We confirmed the altered distribution of SCML2AΔRBR by fluorescence microscopy

. 2, which does not contain BMI1 ( Gao et al., 2012 ) ; the latter is likely due to the higher sensitivity of the BMI1 antibody, although we cannot exclude that some BMI1 target sites are devoid of SCML2. Together with genetic evidence in Drosophila ( Simon et al., 1992 ) and mice ( Takada et al., 2007 ), these observations firmly establish SCML2 as an important player in Polycomb-mediated epigenetic regulation

. SCML2 targets were significantly enriched for gene ontology ( GO ) terms related to transcriptional regulation, development, and differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, Supplementary file 1A ), as observed for targets of the Polycomb repressive machinery in other systems ( Schuettengruber et al., 2007 ). To determine whether SCML2 shared target genes with PRC1, we also performed ChIP-seq for BMI1 ( also known as PCGF4 ), the key component of canonical PRC1. 4 ( Gao et al

. We observed that the PcG protein SCML2, a homolog of Drosophila SCM, consistently co-purified with a relatively large amount of RNA, especially when compared to EZH2 and MLL, which are part of complexes known to interact with ncRNAs ( Rinn et al., 2007; Kaneko et al., 2010, 2013; Wang et al., 2011; Figure 1A ). SCML2 did not co-precipitate with either EZH2 or MLL or vice versa ( data not shown ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02637. 003Figure 1

. To further explore the functional relationship between SCML2 and PRC1, we purified epitope-tagged SCML2A and SCML2B from the chromatin fraction of 293T-REx cells. Both SCML2AWT and SCML2AΔRBR co-purified with all the components of the canonical PRC1, including RING1A, RING1B, CBX2/8, PHC2/3, and BMI1/PCGF4 ( a subunit specific for PRC1. 4 [Gao et al., 2012] ), suggesting that deletion of the RBR does not affect the ability of SCML2A to interact with PRC1

Proteins belonging to the Polycomb and trithorax group are epigenetic regulators and maintain specialized chromatin structures that are refractory or permissive to transcription, respectively ( Schuettengruber et al., 2007 )

. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin localization of SCML2 is achieved through the combined action of the RBR, MBT, and SPM domains and that the expression of ΔRBR mutants of SCML2 causes mislocalization of PRC1.

., 2010b; Wang et al., 2011 ). Because SCML2A exhibited stronger affinity for RNA than for DNA, we hypothesized that interactions between RNA and the RBR may contribute to the recruitment of SCML2 to chromatin. Indeed, we found that deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SC2 at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking the R causes defects in P1 recruitment. These observations suggest a role for RNA in regulating SC2 function and that SC2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription in cooperation with P1

Our results show that SC2 binds to P1 via the SPM and interacts with RNA through a novel R. The targeting of SC2 to chrom involves the coordinated action of the MB, RNA, and interaction with P1 through the S. Deletion of the R reduces the occupancy of SC2 at target and overexpression of mutant SC lacking the causes defects in recruitment. These point to a role in regulating SC function and that SC participates in epigen control of transcription and cooperation with1

We also report that a subset of SC appears to enforce repression independent of P1 via mechanisms to be elucidated. The identification SC as Pc protein binds and contributes to repression Poly targets will shed light on interplay between and epigen regulation and combinator factors drive specificity different contexts.

    Title: Mechanisms of ribosome stalling by SecM at multiple elongation steps
    Abstract: Regulation of translating ribosomes is a major component of gene expression control network. In Escherichia coli, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies reported many residues of SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel are critical for stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clear at the atomic level. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3. 3–3. 7 Å resolution, which reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome.

    Supporting Text:
    To understand the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling, we set out to purify SecM-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes ( RNCs ) using an in vitro translation system from E. coli and to analyze their structures using single particle cryo-EM technique

. In this work, our analysis of ribosome–SecM interactions at near-atomic level reveals two different mechanisms of stalling and provides rich details for how SecM nascent peptide could module the translation in distinct steps. Together with previous and recent structural studies of ribosomes stalled through different ways, including antibiotics ( for examples, see refs ( Jenner et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014; Schluenzen et al

. 10. 7554/eLife. 09684. 029Figure 7. Schematic models of SecM-mediated translation stalling. ( A ) Model illustrating how interactions of SecM within the ribosomal tunnel in SecM-Gly-RNC promote conformational rearrangements of the 23S rRNA nucleotides of U2585, U2506, and A2602, and thereby locks the PTC in the inactive state and not optimized for stable binding and accommodation of the incoming A-site tRNA

. Our structural data of the two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, one in post-state, and the other in hybrid rotated state, indicate that a collection of interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel cooperatively induce conformational changes of the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps, including peptide-bond formation and tRNA translocation.

. Instead, the position of the tRNA-nascent peptide linkage of SecM-tRNA is similar to that seen in the structure of the ribosome with active PTC ( Figure 4B ) ( Polikanov et al., 2014 ). Through the comparison with reference states of the ribosomes that are capable or incapable of peptide-bond formation, we could provide an alternative mechanism of SecM-induced stalling in SecM-Gly-RNC ( Figure 7A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09684. 029Figure 7

., 2003; Goldman et al., 2015 ). Thus, the regulatory peptide within SecM offers a feedback loop on the ribosome to ensure sufficient level of SecA in bacteria to regulate protein secretion. Previous biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated that the ribosome stalling originates from the interaction of the 17-amino-acid nascent peptide of SecM with the 50S exit tunnel components

. Early low-resolution cryo-EM data suggested that recognition of SecM by the tunnel induces a cascade of rRNA rearrangements, propagating from the exit tunnel throughout the large subunit to reorient small subunit rRNA elements, and directly lock the ribosome and mRNAtRNAs complex ( Mitra et al., 2006 ). This hypothesis was argued by improved cryo-EM structure of SecM-arrested ribosome ( SecM-Gly-RNC ) at 5. 6 Å resolution ( Bhushan et al

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09684. 023 Taken together with the kinetic data that SecM increases the lifetime of rotated state of the ribosome ( Tsai et al., 2014 ), our structural data on SecM-Pro-RNC therefore suggest that SecM might also impair the hybrid peptidyl-tRNA accommodation to the P-loop to slow down the tRNA translocation, in addition to its inhibition on peptide bond formation in SecM-Gly-RNC. 10. 7554/eLife. 09684. 024Video 5

. The presence of these specific constrict interactions in the two structures suggests that the bulky residues of SecM, W155, and F150 in particular, function to contain the peptide to slow down its passage within the tunnel to posit N-terminal R163, G165, and P166 at specific locations to induce stalling. Peptide bond formation in the ribosome requires precise positioning of the peptidyl-tRNA and the A-tRNA ( Polikanov et al., 2014; Schmeing et al., 2005a; Schmeing et al., 2005b )

., 2003; Kiser and Schmidt, 1999; McNicholas et al., 1997; Nakatogawa and Ito, 2001, 2002; Sarker and Oliver, 2002 ). Therefore, as a response to compromised secretion activity in the cell, the synthesis of SecA is upregulated. The stalling sequence of SecM could also induce ribosome stalling under normal conditions, but it is only temporary and quickly rescued by the functional Sec system through a simple pulling force by translocon ( Butkus et al., 2003; Goldman et al., 2015 )

In the present work, we obtained two high-resolution structures of SecM-arrested ribosomes, one in the post-translocational state and the other in the rotated state. The first one, SecM-Gly-RNC, contains a peptidyl-tRNA in classical P/P-site and therefore is expected to display an overall conformation similar to the classical PRE/POST states of the ribosome. However, compared with the cryo-EM solution structures of the pre-translocational ribosome ( three tRNAs ) ( Brilot et al

., 2014; Seidelt et al., 2009 ). In Escherichia coli, SecM-mediated translation stalling is specifically employed to regulate the secretion pathway of the cell ( McNicholas et al., 1997; Nakatogawa and Ito, 2001; Oliver et al., 1998 ). SecM is encoded by the 5’-end half of a bicistronic mRNA, secM-secA. SecA is an ATPase-dependent molecular motor helping secretory and outer membrane proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria ( Bauer et al

., 2014 ). Therefore, the impaired accommodation of the A/P-tRNA into the ribosomal P-loop might be responsible for observed delay in tRNA translocation from hybrid A/P site into classical P/P site in the FRET data ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). This indicates, in addition to its inhibitive effect on peptide bond formation, SecM also slows down tRNA translocation. It should be noted that, similar as previous studies of ribosome stalling ( Bhushan et al

. These interactions do not significantly change the conformation of the ribosome, but lead to a distortion on the CCA-end of the A/P*-tRNA and thereby disrupting the canonical base paring between the CCA-end and the ribosomal P-loop. As shown in previous FRET data, during translation of SecM peptide, the lifetime of the rotated state of the ribosome significantly increases between codons, requiring increased EF-G sampling without inhibiting EF-G binding ( Tsai et al., 2014 )

., 2010; Woolhead et al., 2006 ). Previous structural studies of the SecM-arrested ribosome suggested that the interaction between the exit tunnel and the arrest peptide could change the conformation of the PTC ( peptidyl-transferase center ) to slow down the peptide bond formation ( Bhushan et al., 2011; Gumbart et al., 2012 )

., 2014 ) show that the lifetime of the rotated-state ribosome significantly increased when the codon of P166 is at the A-site. Therefore, combining our structural observations in SecM-Pro-RNC, a stalling mechanism in SecM-Pro-RNC could be outlined in the below ( Figure 7B ). Interactions between the nascent chain and the tunnel in SecM-Pro-RNC are considerably different at atomic level from those in SecM-Gly-RNC

    Title: Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length
    Abstract: We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching ( decrease in cones/mm2 ), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density ( increase in cones/deg2 ) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.

    Supporting Text:
   . With the improvements in resolution of adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes, imaging the smallest cones at the foveal center is now possible in many eyes, enabling a definitive analysis of the cone density at the fovea as a function of eye length.

. All studies that find myopic visual deficits implicate retinal stretching as a possible cause, but what is actually happening structurally at the foveal center during myopic progression is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to more carefully investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center. Two types of cone densities will be discussed in this study

. ( 2010 ) and Chui et al. ( 2008 ) near the fovea were to extend to the foveal center, then myopes would have higher foveal photoreceptor sampling resolution with a consequent potential for better performance on visual tasks compared to emmetropes. As such, the simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes – increased separation between cones caused by retinal stretching – would have to be ruled out

., 1987 ), adaptive optics offers the highest contrast en face images of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic ever recorded in vivo ( Dubra et al., 2011; Roorda et al., 2002 ). Despite continued advances in image quality, previous studies investigating cone packing and eye length have not made their measurements at the foveal center, the most important region for spatial vision but the most difficult to image owing to the small size of photoreceptors

., 1998 ). If the enlargement of the retinal image exactly matched the stretching of the cone mosaic, then eyes of different lengths would sample the visual field similarly. In fact, in large scale studies, myopes generally attain reasonably good visual acuity with optical correction ( He et al., 2004; Jong et al., 2018 )

. A more recent study measured peak cone densities in the fovea as well as axial length for 22 eyes of 22 subjects ( Wilk et al., 2017 ) but they did not plot peak cone density as a function of axial length, as it was not the aim of their study. We plotted the data they provided in their paper and found that the linear cone density at the foveal center dropped significantly with increases in axial length, similar to what was found by Li et al. ( 2010 ) and Chui et al

All the biometric measures used to convert angular dimensions to linear retinal dimensions are listed on Table 2. The strong correlation between refractive error and eye length ( p<0. 0001 ) indicates that the myopia in this cohort was predominantly as a result of axial length. Images of the foveal region, the preferred retinal locus for fixation ( PRL ) and the fixation stability were recorded with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( see Materials and methods )

. They found a significant decrease ( p<0. 05 ) in linear cone density as a function of eye length at 1 mm ( which, by angular distance, is closer to the fovea in a longer eye than in a shorter eye ) in all directions except in the nasal retina. They found that the angular cone density at three degrees ( which, by linear distance, is closer to the fovea, in a shorter eye than in a longer eye ) increased with eye length, but the trends were not significant. Li et al

. In this scenario, longer eyes will show both increased linear cone density and an even steeper increase in angular cone density. The model is motivated by observations of increased linear cone density in the foveas of marmosets that underwent lens-induced eye growth ( Troilo, 1998 )

. Li et al. ( 2010 ) made similar measures, but closer to the fovea ( from 0. 10 mm to 0. 30 mm eccentricity ). They found that linear cone density decreased with eye length, but the trends were not significant at the smallest eccentricities ( 0. 1 and 0. 2 mm ). When the data were plotted in angular units and angular distance from the fovea, they found that angular cone density trended toward an increase with eye length but none of the trends were significant

. The plots clearly indicate that although stretching does occur ( Figure 5A ) it is not a simple global expansion and longer eyes have higher sampling density. The trends hold at and around fovea with statistical significance. A more relevant measure of the impact of eye length on vision is how the angular cone density changes at the PRL, which is often displaced from the location of peak cone density ( Li et al., 2010; Putnam et al., 2005; Wilk et al., 2017 )

. axial length. Therefore, the PRL was not more displaced in myopes than in emmetropes from the point of peak cone density. Plots of the cone density at the PRL with axial length show the same trend at the PRL as at the point of maximum cone density ( Figure 6A and B ). Finally, we explored whether fixational eye movements might have a dependency on axial length. Fixation stability around the PRL had an average standard deviation of 3. 94 arcminutes and 19. 84 microns

. The most definitive studies of cone spacing as a function of axial length are done through direct imaging of the retina – wherein sharp images of the cones are enabled through the use of adaptive optics, a set of technologies that actively compensate the blur caused by aberrations of the eye ( Liang et al., 1997 ). Combined with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( Webb et al

One might expect that eye growth would stretch the photoreceptor layer and would increase the spacing between cones, causing a longer eye to more coarsely sample an image relative to a shorter eye. However the situation is not that simple; the axial elongation associated with eye growth is accompanied by magnification of the retinal image ( Strang et al., 1998 )

. ( 2010 ) observed at the location closest to the fovea ( slope = 531 cones/deg2 for each mm increase in axial length; standard deviation of the regression errors = 1377 cones/deg2 ), we estimated that data from approximately 32 eyes, evenly distributed across a range of axial lengths would be sufficient to show if there was a true effect at the fovea

. Most notably, Atchison et al. ( 2006 ) and Coletta and Watson ( 2006 ) show clear deficits in retinal resolution ( cyc/mm ) with increasing myopia using interferometric methods which bypass the optics of the eye and Rossi et al. ( 2007 ) show significant deficits in angular resolution ( cyc/deg ) in low myopes, even after using adaptive optics to correct for optical blur

. Figure 1 illustrates three models, along the lines of Strang et al. ( 1998 ), of how photoreceptor structure might be affected by myopic eye growth. In the first model, called the global expansion model, the retina is proportionally stretched with increasing axial length - cones are more spaced out in longer eyes - and linear density decreases with eye length

., 2004; Jong et al., 2018 ). However, more careful inspection reveals that myopes generally ( 6 out of 9 studies ) have poorer angular resolution and have uniformly ( 3 out of 3 studies ) poorer retinal resolution. Table 1 summarizes published results from psychophysical foveal tasks. Most notably, Atchison et al

., 2005; Wilk et al., 2017 ). If, for example, longer eyes had more displaced PRLs then that could diminish, or even reverse, the trend of increased angular density with eye length reported in Figure 5B. We found that the average displacement between PRL and maximum cone density was 6. 1 arcminutes and 30. 4 microns. There was no significant linear relationship found between PRL displacement in either angular or linear units vs. axial length

. Since the retina is moving further from the secondary nodal point, more cones will fall within a fixed angular area and the angular cone density will increase with eye length. The final model is called the magnification model, wherein the retinal image is magnified as the eye grows and cones are packed more densely in longer eyes. This model is supported by observations of increased cone density in the fove of marmets that underwent lens-induced growth ( Troilo,1998 ) and Li et al (2010 ) found similar measures but closer to the fove ( 0.10 to 0.30 eccentricity ) that linear density decreased with length but trends were not significant at smallest eccentricities 0 1 and 0 2. When plotted in angular units and distance from fove, they found angular density trend toward increase with length but none were significant. The plots clearly indicate that stretching occur but is not simple expansion and longer have higher density The trends hold and around fove with significance A relevant measure of impact eye on vision is how angular density at PRL which often displaced from location peak density Li et al 201 Putnam 2005 Wilk 2017 axial therefore P not displaced myopes emmetes point peak density plots density with length show same PRL point maximum Figure 6A B Finally explored fixational movements dependency length fix stability around P had average 3 94 arc 84 microns

The study aimed to investigate the relationship between the length of the eye and cone density at the fove center in 28 eyes of 16 subjects using an adaptive optics scanning ophthalmoscope. The results show that the fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove but not proportion to length Despite retinal decrease cones/mm myopes generally have higher angular density increase cones/deg around the fove compared to emmetes offering potential better visual acuity reports deficits best-corrected fove vision myopes emetrop cannot explained increased spacing photore caused retinal stretching my progression

    Title: Genome-wide identification of lineage and locus specific variation associated with pneumococcal carriage duration
    Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here ( age and previous carriage ) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype ( 17% ), drug-resistance ( 9% ) and other significant locus effects ( 7% ). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.

    Supporting Text:
    Other than serotype, the genetic determinants of pneumococcal carriage duration were previously unknown. By developing models for longitudinal swab data and combining the results with whole genome sequence data we have quantified and mapped the genetic contribution to the carriage duration of S. pneumoniae

. Importantly, our analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work ( Lehtinen et al., 2017 ). Here we have shown that these alleles do exist in a natural population, and also identified candidates for the loci which fulfil this role. Together these studies suggest that variants exist in the pneumococcal genome which alter carriage duration, which in turn is linked to antibiotic resistance

. pneumoniae. We found that despite a range of other factors such as host age which are known to cause carriage duration to differ, sequence variation of the pneumococcal genome explains most of this variability ( 63% ). Common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin cause some of this effect ( 19% total ), as does the presence or absence of particular prophage sequence in the genome. Table 5 summarise the sources we found to be significantly associated with variation in carriage duration

. We provide a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration, and show evidence for differences both between and within serotypes. The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes in this dataset

. 686 ). This implies that the genetics of S. pneumoniae is an important factor in determining carriage duration in this population. If environmental conditions are associated with streptococcal genotype between populations ( such as host vaccination status ) the heritability estimate may differ. A lower bound on h2 can be calculated by fitting a linear mixed model through maximum likelihood to common SNPs ( hSNP2 ) ( Lee et al., 2011; Manolio et al., 2009 )

. In the context of genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) in bacteria strong linkage-disequilibrium ( LD ) is present across the entire genome, making it difficult to pinpoint variants associated with carriage duration and not just present in the background of longer or shorter carried lineages ( Chen and Shapiro, 2015 ). In S. pneumoniae, serotype and antibiogram are correlated with the overall genome sequence ( Brueggemann et al., 2003; Chewapreecha et al

. We sought to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration in a human population, and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration. By combining epidemiological modelling of longitudinal swab data with and genome wide association study methods on the connected sequences ( Figure 1 ), we made heritability estimates for carriage duration

. The pneumococcus spends most of the transmission cycle in the nasopharynx, and so understanding and predicting the amount of time spent in this niche is critical for understanding this bacterium's epidemiology, and therefore controlling transmission ( Abdullahi et al., 2012a; Melegaro et al., 2007 ). The nasopharynx is a complex niche in which each pneumococcal genotype must tackle a wide range of factors including host immune defence ( McCool et al

. We therefore hypothesise that the associated prophage sequences may affect carriage duration through disruption of the competence system, without which deleterious mutations will accumulate in the population due to Muller's ratchet. The results presented here have important implications for the modelling of pneumococcal transmission and their response to perturbation of the population by vaccine

., 2002 ), other bacterial species ( Pericone et al., 2000 ), and other pneumococcal lineages ( Auranen et al., 2010; Cobey and Lipsitch, 2012 ) in order to maintain the genotype's population. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is therefore affected by a large number of factors, which may, themselves, interact

., 2004 ). The variation in carriage duration σP2 is partly caused by variance in pneumococcal genetics, and variance in other potentially unknown factors such as host age and host genetics. It is common to write this sum as two components: genetic effects σG2 and environmental effects σE2. The proportion of the overall variation which can be explained by the genetics of the bacterium is known as the broad-sense heritability H2=σG2σG2+σE2

. 3161 randomly selected pneumococcal positive swabs from the study population have been previously sequenced, 2175 of which were from these longitudinal infant samples ( Chewapreecha et al., 2014a ). Latex sweeps could not differentiate 6A and 6C serotypes, so we treated these as a single serotype when detected by this method ( in WHO serotyping PCR was used to differentiate these serotypes ). 15B and 15C serotypes spontaneously interconvert, so were combined

. That some serotypes are rarer and carried for shorter time periods may be evidence of competitive exclusion ( Hardin, 1960; Trzciński et al., 2015 ), as fitter serotypes quickly replace less fit serotypes thus leading to reduced carriage duration. The calculated mean carriage duration of NT pneumococci is similar to the minimum resolution we were able to measure by the study design, which suggests carriage episodes may actually be shorter than one month

. In addition variation of pathogen protein sequence, accessory genes and interaction effects between genetic elements may also have as yet unknown effects on carriage duration. Changes in average carriage duration have been shown to be linked with recombination rate ( Chaguza et al., 2016 ), which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance ( Hanage et al., 2009 ) and invasive potential ( Chaguza et al., 2016 )

., 2016 ). The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) ( Melegaro et al., 2007; Weinberger et al., 2011 )

. Conversely, some bacterial genetic variation has been shown to be able to affect colonisation independent of serotype ( Khan et al., 2014 ). We therefore wished to test whether the detected effect of serotype and resistance on carriage duration was entirely mediated through their covariance with lineage, or whether they are independently associated with carriage duration

. Therefore any prophage locus that enhances a virus’ ability to infect long carriage duration pneumococci may have an elevated correlation with the variation in the observed phenotype. As phage commonly exhibit high levels of strain specificity ( Duplessis and Moineau, 2001 ), this is a plausible mechanism, although the role of the replication module in such host preference is unclear

. One explanation for these results is that a subpopulation of prophage do not cause a significant decrease in their host bacterium's carriage duration, which could be due to beneficial ‘cargo’ genes. Yet previous surveys of pneumococcal prophage have found little evidence of these elements carrying such sequences ( Croucher et al., 2014a; Romero et al., 2009 )

., 2011 ) and has previously been associated with differences in carriage duration ( Abdullahi et al., 2012a; Turner et al., 2012 ). We also included resistance to six antibiotics, the causal element to some of which are known to be associated with specific lineages ( Lees et al., 2016 ). These are therefore possible lineage effects which would be unlikely to be found associated under a model which adjusts for population structure ( Chen and Shapiro, 2015 )

. We applied linear regression to these factors while using the first 30 PCs to correct for the effect of the bacterial genome, which showed they were both significantly associated with carriage duration as expected ( age p=3. 9×10-7; previous carriage p=2.1×10-4 ). The first 30 PCs explained 99% of the variation in the pneumoc genome, and were used to correct for the effect of the genome in the model. We found that serotype, resistance and prophage were associated with carriage duration independent of each other, and other factors such as age and previous carriage ( Table 2 ). The effect of prophage on carriage was independent of serotype ( p= 0.01 ) and age ( p= 0.01 ) and previous carriage ( p= 0.01 ) The effect of ser was independent of prophage ( p= 0.01 ) and age ( p 0.01 ) and previous ( p 0.01 ) The effect of resistance was independent of both ser ( p 0.01 ) and prophage ( 0.01 ) and age ( 0.01 ) and previous ( 0.01 ) The effect of age was independent of both ser ( 0.01 ) and prophage (0.01 ) and previous (0.01 ) The effect of previous was independent of ser (0.01 ) and proph (0.01 ) and age (0.01 ) The effect of prophage was independent of ser (0.01 ) age (.01 ) and previous (.01 The effect of ser was independent of prophage (.01 ) age (. ) previous.01 The effect of resistance was independent of prophage (.01 age. ) previous.01 The effect of age was independent prophage (.01 previous.01 ) The effect of previous was independent prophage (.01.01 ) The effect of prophage was independent ser (.01 age. ) previous.01 The effect ser was independent prophage (.01 age. previous.01 The effect of resistance was prophage (.01 age. previous.01 The effect of age was prophage (. previous.01 The effect previous was prophage (.01.01 The effect prophage was ser (. age. previous.01 The ser was prophage (. age. previous.01 The resistance was prophage ( age. previous.01 The age prophage was ( previous..01 The previousage was proph (..01 The prophage was ( age..

    Title: Unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking of the IKs channel complex demonstrates a KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry of up to 4:4
    Abstract: Cardiac repolarization is determined in part by the slow delayed rectifier current ( IKs ), through the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel, KCNQ1, and its β-subunit, KCNE1. The stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been controversial with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used IKs fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one ( EQ ), two ( EQQ ) or four ( EQQQQ ) KCNQ1 subunits, to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ - all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex.

   ., 2009 ). Flexibility in KCNQ1’s β-subunits association, both in number and in type, allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

Kv7. 1 ( KCNQ1 ) is a voltage gated potassium channel expressed throughout the body. When paired with the accessory β-subunit, KCNE1, it has unique properties in several tissues, particularly the myocardium and inner ear. In the heart, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 together conduct the slow delayed rectifier current ( IKs ). This current is primarily responsible for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates ( Marx et al., 2002; Ackerman, 1998 )

. However, during a normal cardiac action potential this would result in limited activation. If the stoichiometry can be regulated based on availability, ( Nakajo et al., 2010 ) then altering the expression could change the distribution of channel composition, shifting the overall activation kinetics of the current. Additionally, there is evidence for the association of other β-subunits. All five of the KCNE genes ( KCNE1-5 ) can be expressed in cardiomyocytes ( Lundquist et al

. Here, we sought to clarify this issue using fusion channels where KCNE1 was linked to one ( EQ - 4:4 ), two ( EQQ – 2:4 ) or four ( EQQQQ - 1:4 ) KCNQ1s. The channel complexes were evaluated in mammalian cells on their own or in combination with additional independent KCNE1 subunits using whole cell patch clamp, single-channel recordings and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches

., 2000; Yu et al., 2013 ). Despite the significant role of this ion channel complex in health and disease, the stoichiometry of the binding between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 remains controversial. Since the identification of the components that comprise this channel almost 20 years ago, several studies have reported a ratio of two β-subunits to every four α-subunits ( Kang et al., 2008; Wang and Goldstein, 1995; Chen et al

The number of β-subunits present in the IKs channel complex is critical for its regulation. Here, we have shown that up to four KCNE1 subunits can associate with the KCNQ1 tetramer. Variable association allows for greater flexibility in the modulation of IKs current but also potentially increases the heterogeneity of channel species in the membrane

. ( 2014 ) reported that KCNQ1 tetramers were only present on the cell surface in a 2:4 or 0:4 stoichiometry with KCNE1. They also found that the 2:4 ratio was not exceeded even in the presence of increasing KCNE1 concentrations. Their observation of a maximum of 2 KCNE1 subunits per tetramer suggests an intrinsic cooperative mechanism preventing the association of a third or fourth β-subunit during channel assembly

., 2010 ). A characterization of IKs currents in dog cardiac myocytes determined the V1/2 at 37°C for IKs across different regions of the ventricular wall to be ~25 mV ( Liu and Antzelevitch, 1995 ). Additionally, co-localization studies of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 in rat cardiomyocytes indicated that KCNE1 is present in excess ( Wang et al., 2013 )

To help differentiate possible channel complex stoichiometries, we created three IKs fusion constructs ( Figure 1A ). The C-terminus of KCNE1 was connected with the N-terminus of KCNQ1 via a flexible linker ( EQ ), forcing a 4:4 stoichiometry of β and α subunits. An additional one or three KCNQ1 subunits were linked to the construct to make EQQ and EQQQQ, respectively ( Yu et al., 2013; Wang, 1998; Nakajo et al., 2010 )

. One consequence of the prolonged debate over IKs stoichiometry has been to suppress investigation of sub-saturating KCNE1 on the regulation of KCNQ1. Since the nature of the channel complex has been in doubt, it has been difficult to consider the effects of a partially chaperoned channel. By confirming that IKs has a variable stoichiometry up to 4:4, our analysis of EQQ provides some insights into the channel’s regulation

., 2013; Wang, 1998; Nakajo et al., 2010 ). A priori, EQQ, establishes a 2:4 KCNE1 to KCNQ1 subunit stoichiometry, and leaves two unoccupied clefts on each channel’s exterior, while EQQQQ has a 1:4 ratio with three unoccupied clefts. KCNQ1, EQQQQ, EQQ and EQ were expressed independently in mammalian tsA201 cells and the resulting currents were characterized by whole cell patch clamp ( Figure 1B )

While determining the subunit stoichiometry was our primary goal, there were some additional observations of interest for KCNE1’s role in modulating channel gating. The V1/2’s of the current-voltage relationships for KCNQ1 alone, EQQQQ, EQQ, and EQ, increased linearly with increasing KCNE1 presence ( Figure 6 ), as can also be observed using the data presented by Yu et al. ( 2013 )

. Analysis of the fast rate constants revealed more rapid F57Bpa KCNE1 crosslinking as the number of potentially available clefts increased ( EQQ – 2 clefts, 0. 55 ± 0. 06 s-1; EQQQQ – 3 clefts, 0. 63 ± 0. 06 s-1; KCNQ1 – 4 clefts, 1. 12 ± 0. 09 s-1 ( n = 5–7 ) ) ( Figure 5G ). These findings demonstrate that more F57Bpa KCNE1-GFP subunits are interacting with the KCNQ1 channel complexes, as more clefts are available

. 7554/eLife. 11815. 00310. 7554/eLife. 11815. 004Figure 1—source data 1. V1/2 of activation for IKs channel complexes DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11815. 004 Next, KCNQ1, EQQQQ, EQQ and EQ were co-expressed with a KCNE1-GFP construct. GFP was included in the construct to verify that KCNE1 was expressed and localized to the plasma membrane in each cell patched. The resulting currents were characterized using the same protocol ( Figure 1C )

., 2015 ). The best characterized of these accessory subunits is KCNE1, a single transmembrane domain protein proposed to reside in the exterior cleft formed between the voltage sensor domains of the α-subunits ( Sanguinetti et al., 1996; Barhanin et al., 1996; Osteen et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2008; Van Horn et al., 2011 ). The association of KCNE1 has been found to increase channel conductance, remove inactivation, and depolarize the voltage dependence of activation

. A 4 s isochronal activation protocol ranging from -80 to +100 mV was used to determine the V1/2 of activation ( Figure 1D ). As is known, KCNQ1 expressed alone had a V1/2 of -15. 5 mV, while the presence of additional tethered β-subunits resulted in a progressive depolarization of the V1/2 of activation ( Figure 1D ). The V/2 of EQ, EQQ, EQQ, and EQ were -10.5, -7.5 and -5.5 mV, respectively. These results are consistent with previous reports of KC1’s role in modulating the voltage dependence of activation ( Yu et al,2013; Wang et al,199; Nakajo et,2010 ). The depolarization of the V/ with increasing KC1 is likely due to the interaction of the β-sub with the voltage sensor domains of the α-subunits ( Kang et al,2008; Wang et,199; Chen etal,1995 )

In addition to modulating the voltage dependence of activation, KC1 also reduced the latency of the first opening of the channel ( Figure 1E ). The latency of KCQ alone was 1.5 ms, while that of EQ, EQQ and EQQ were 0.5 and 0.5 ms, respectively. This effect of KC1 on latency is consistent with previous reports ( Wang et al,199; Nakajo et,201 ) and is likely due to the interaction of the β-sub with the voltage sensor domains of the α-sub ( Kang et,200; Wang,199; Chen et,199 )

The effect of KC1 on the conductance of the channel was also examined ( Figure 1F ). The conductance of KCQ alone was 10 pS, while that of EQ, EQ and EQQ were 8 and 6 pS, respectively. This reduction in conductance is consistent with previous reports of KC’s effect on the channel ( Wang et,199; Nakajo,201 ) and is likely due to the interaction of the β-sub with the pore of the α-sub ( Kang et,200; Wang,199; Chen,199 )

To further investigate the stoichiometry of the channel, unnatural amino acid crosslinking was used to crosslink KC1 to the KCQ subunits ( Figure 2 ). The crosslinking rates of EQQ and EQQ to KCQ were progressively slower than that of KCQ ( Figure 2 ), indicating that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of up to four β-subunits within the IK complex. This is consistent with the results from the fusion proteins and whole-cell recordings, which showed that up to four KC1 subunits can associate with the KCQ tetramer. The slower crosslink rates of EQ and EQQ to KCQ are likely due to the increased steric hindrance from the additional β-subunits, making it more difficult for the crosslink to reach the KCQ subunits

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the stoichi of the IK channel can be up to 4:4. This flexibility in stoichi allows for modulation of repolarization in the heart through changes in expression of the channel. The association of up to four KC1 subunits with the KCQ tetramer also increases the heterogeneity of channel species in the membrane, potentially affecting the overall function of the channel. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of IK and the role of KC1 in modulating the channel’s properties. The use of unnatural amino acid crosslinking and fusion proteins allowed us to clarify the stoichi of the channel and demonstrate that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of up four β-subunits within the IK complex. The results have implications for understanding the regulation of repolarization in the heart and the role of KC1 in modulating the channel’s properties.

    Title: Transient inflammatory response mediated by interleukin-1β is required for proper regeneration in zebrafish fin fold
    Abstract: Cellular responses to injury are crucial for complete tissue regeneration, but their underlying processes remain incompletely elucidated. We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express il1b in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.

   . Thus, our study has revealed that Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation act as a double-edged sword: they are required for regeneration, but in excess, they impair tissue regeneration ( Figure 8 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 018Figure 8. Schematic of the role of Il1b and macrophages during fin fold regeneration. ( A and B ) Tissue injury induces il1b expression in epithelial cells

., 2012 ), and genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish was demonstrated to affect fin ray patterning and fin growth ( Petrie et al., 2014 ). These studies suggest that macrophages play a critical role in tissue regeneration, but the precise function of the cells remains unknown. Our study has, for the first time, elucidated a role of macrophages in attenuating il1b expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration

. Here, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b is provided by epidermal cells in response to tissue injury. We showed that apoptosis occurred if the Il1b action at the injury site was prolonged, and that macrophages were responsible for attenuation of il1b expression and resolution of inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that normal il1b expression and inflammatory response are necessary in tissue regeneration to activate expression of regeneration-induced genes

. Collectively, these data support the notion that excessive Il1b signaling and inflammation in response to tissue injury represent a cause of apoptosis in the clo mutant. We have previously shown that the presence of myeloid cells is essential for survival of regenerative cells ( Hasegawa et al., 2015 ). Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and macrophages have been shown to transiently migrate to the injured fin fold ( Li et al., 2012 )

. Lastly, we show that Il1b signaling plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study highlights the function of Il1b and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. A proper level of il1b expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration.

. The Il1b acts on the surrounding cells to prime them for regeneration by triggering expression of regeneration-induced genes such as fn1b, junba, junbb, and fgf20a. ( C ) The macrophage-derived factor subsequently attenuates il1b expression during normal regeneration. ( D ) In the absence of macrophages, apoptosis is induced in the primed regenerative cells. Thus, the Il1b function is a double-edged sword in tissue regeneration. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22716

. In addition to inducing the aberrant apoptosis, il1b overexpression suppressed the extension of the fin fold ( Figure 6E and F ). Our data thus far suggest that excessive Il1b-mediated inflammation negatively affects the survival of regenerative cells and tissue regeneration in the clo mutant. However, inflammation has also been suggested to be essential for complete tissue regeneration ( Mathew et al., 2007; King et al., 2012; Kyritsis et al., 2012 )

. Several recent studies have used the zebrafish model and addressed the roles of myeloid cells in response to tissue injury: Li and coworkers ( Li et al., 2012 ) showed that knockdown of macrophage differentiation delayed fin fold regeneration and resulted in formation of an abnormal fin fold featuring large vacuoles. Furthermore, Petrie and coworkers ( Petrie et al

. In this study, we further demonstrated that macrophages play a crucial role in fin fold regeneration by attenuating il1b expression and supporting survival of regenerative cells. Recent studies have shown that knockdown of macrophage differentiation delayed fin fold regeneration and resulted in an abnormal fin fold featuring large vacuoles ( Li et al

. Importantly, similar to the Dex-treated larvae, the il1b morphants showed attenuated expression of junba and fgf20a ( Figure 7J ). Collectively, these results suggest that the inflammatory reaction mediated by Il1b plays a necessary role in normal fin fold regeneration. Lastly, we tested whether il1b overexpression induces a marked increase in expression of the regeneration-induced genes junba, junbb, and fn1b in uninjured tissue ( Figure 7K )

., 2014 ) showed that genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish impaired fin outgrowth and often induced an abnormal fin. These studies suggest a crucial role for macrophages in tissue regeneration; however, the mechanism by which myeloid cells affect regeneration remains to be elucidated

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 017 Next, we used il1b knockdown in WT zebrafish to demonstrate the role of Il1b signaling in normal regeneration: il1b knockdown induced a similar phenotype to Dex treatment ( Figure 7F–I ), although the phenotype was slightly milder than that of the Dex-treated larvae, probably because of lower penetrance of the MO knockdown

. Moreover, although myeloid cells are widely regarded as the main cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il1b and thereby promote inflammation, we demonstrate that epidermal cells surrounding the amputated tissue are the source of Il1b in both wild-type ( WT ) and clo larvae. Notably, il1b expression in the regenerating epidermis is usually quenched by the action of macrophages, and a lack of this anti-inflammatory effect of the macrophages results in apoptosis

. Here, we show that a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene, interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ), is aberrantly upregulated in the clo mutant, and that the resulting excessive and prolonged inflammation causes apoptosis of the regenerative cells

. That study suggested that the regenerative cells are sensitive to apoptosis during tissue regeneration, but the mechanism of this sensitization and the identity of the survival factor remain unknown. Myeloid cells are widely recognized to play a role in protection against pathogens and microorganisms after tissue injury

. In accordance with our observation, macrophage-depleted mice and salamanders were found to display elevated il1b expression ( Goren et al., 2009; Godwin et al., 2013 ), which suggests that the macrophage function of attenuating il1b transcription is conserved in other vertebrate species. Our observation of macrophage accumulation in the injured fin fold suggests that the macrophage migration could play a role in attenuating il1b expression and quenching inflammation

It has been suggested that myeloid cells play crucial roles in the inflammatory responses of injured tissues. The pro-inflammatory cytokines ( such as Il1b ) produced by myeloid cells, including macrophages, induce early responses against infection or injury ( Dinarello, 2009 ). Thus, myeloid cells are considered to trigger inflammation by providing pro-inflammatory cytokines

., 2012; Kyritsis et al., 2012 ). To examine the role of tissue inflammation and Il1b during normal fin fold regeneration, we used Dex and il1b MO1 and tested whether the inflammation mediated by Il1b affects normal fin fold regeneration. To assess the role of inflammation in tissue regeneration, we administered Dex to WT larvae and assessed fin fold regeneration

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 013 To further demonstrate that excessive il1b expression induces apoptosis, we generated and used the construct pTol2 ( hsp70l:mCherry-T2a-il1b ), which we hereafter refer to as pTol2 ( hsp70l:il1b ). The precise cleavage site of the zebrafish Il1b pro-peptide has not yet been identified ( Vojtech et al

., 2014; Karra et al., 2015 ). The anti-inflammatory molecules bind to cell surface receptors to activate intracellular pathways and antagonize the nFkB and/or STAT3 signals to attenuate il1b transcription ( Yu et al., 2009; Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010; Liao et al., 2011 ). Our data suggest that macrophages play a crucial role in attenuating ilb expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration, and that excessive ilb expression causes apoptosis of regenerative cells

Our results show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine Ilb is provided by epider cells in response to tissue injury, and that macroages are responsible for attenuation of ilb expression and resolution of inflammation, and that normal levels of ilb and inflammatory response are necessary for tissue regeneration to activate expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study highlights the function of Ilb and the response in tissue regeneration, and that proper levels of ilb and the response, tuned by macroages, are necessary for progression of tissue.

    Title: Ribosome surface properties may impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome
    Abstract: Much of the molecular motion in the cytoplasm is diffusive, which possibly limits the tempo of processes. We studied the dependence of protein mobility on protein surface properties and ionic strength. We used surface-modified fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) and determined their translational diffusion coefficients ( D ) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Haloferax volcanii. We find that in E. coli D depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is probably caused by interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes as shown in in vivo diffusion measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. This finding lays bare a paradox in the functioning of prokaryotic ( endo ) symbionts.

    Supporting Text:
   . In L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii the slowdown in diffusion with increasing positive surface charge is less than in E. coli due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in diffusion coefficient is mainly caused by binding of positive proteins to ribosomes, with KD values on the order of µM; this shows that non-selected interactions need not be weak. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome

. 04 µm2/s ) leads to the same diffusion coefficient as 99% binding to DNA ( DDNA=0. 000035–0. 00007 µm2/s ). We find that the diffusion coefficients of proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli depend on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with positive proteins moving up to 100-fold slower. The diffusion becomes even slower when cells are exposed to an osmotic upshift. In L. lactis and Hfx

. coli, L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii. Positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but their binding to ribosomes might also inhibit protein synthesis, that is, by affecting the assembly or the activity of ribosomes. As mentioned, there are 18 ribosomal proteins in E. coli that have a net charge of more than +10. If the findings on GFP are transferable to ribosomal proteins, then these ribosomal proteins experience a drop in diffusion coefficient of more than 5-fold

. To determine the consequences of our findings we analyzed the proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii and four ( endo ) symbiotic bacteria. We determine ( i ) how a protein will diffuse in light of the composition of the proteome, for which we need to know both the net charges and the abundances of all proteome components; and ( ii ) how the ribosomes affect the diffusion of the proteome constituents, for which we need to know the net charge of the proteins

Many processes in biological cells depend on interactions between macromolecules ( proteins and nucleic acids ) and thus on the ability of these macromolecules to find each other by translational diffusion. This is especially important in prokaryotes because of the virtual absence of active mechanisms of cytoplasmic transport. It is clear that macromolecules need to diffuse for cells to function

. Why does the diffusion coefficient drop with net positive charge? The first thing to realize is that almost nothing in the cytoplasm of the E. coli cell truly stands still. The membrane rearranges itself continuously and the DNA has some diffusive motion and rearranges itself during the cell cycle. If +25 GFP would stick to another average sized protein it would not move more slowly than the combination of the two can diffuse

. For L. lactis, with seven cytoplasmic proteins that have a net charge bigger than +10, the breakdown is similar. The only Hfx. volcanii protein with a net charge bigger than 0 is a ribonuclease, rnp4, with a net charge of +6. Thus, all three organisms essentially have no ‘free’ positive cytoplasmic proteins. The drop in diffusion coefficient with increased positive charge may partly explain why the proteome is mostly negative in E. coli, L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii

. For this experiment we used ( ribosome containing ) lysates of −7 or +25 GFP expressing E. coli cells. The cell lysates were 200–300 times diluted relative to the cytoplasmic contents. The contents of the lysates were separated by centrifugation on a linear sucrose gradient and we determined the presence of the GFPs, by fluorescence spectroscopy, in fractions taken along the length of the gradient. We also determined the presence of ribosomes by electron microscopy

. All diffusion coefficients were determined by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching ( FRAP ). We study these proteins in the bacteria Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis and the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. These three organisms differ in their cytoplasmic ionic strength as shown by measurements on the dominant cation, K+: E. coli ( 0. 2 M ) ( Shabala et al., 2009 ), L. lactis ( 0. 8 M ) ( Poolman et al., 1987 ) ( note: L

Second, the diffusion coefficient of GFP is faster in the cytoplasm of osmotically-adapted E. coli cells than in osmotically-upshifted cells, even at similar cytoplasmic macromolecule volume fraction ( Konopka et al., 2009 )

. Fluorescence images show that most, if not all, fluorescence is located in the cytoplasm, leaving DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA as the most likely ( major ) binding partners. We cannot rule out that some of the GFP binds to the membrane but we did not find evidence for it in our images of E. coli cells. We also determined diffusion coefficients of the GFP variants in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii ( Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1B ). For L

., 1998 ). Because protein diffusion is influenced by the environment, we need to determine diffusion coefficients in the context of the cell. The cytoplasm of cells is not only crowded with macromolecules ( van den Berg et al., 2017 ) but also consists of various types of nucleic acids and >1000 types of protein ( see proteome analysis below ) ; though only 50 protein types make up 85% of the cytoplasmic proteome of E. coli ( McGuffee et al., 2010 )

. coli the GFP diffusion coefficient levels off towards more negative charge. We assumed that ( 3 ) GFPs bind solely to ribosomes; this we have shown experimentally. We assumed that ( 4 ) the total number of binding sites on all ribosomes is higher than the number of GFPs. The first justification is that the number of binding sites is about 106 and it is unlikely that we express that many GFPs because the cell only has about 3 × 106 total proteins

., 2009 ). Third, the diffusion coefficient of GFP drops much faster with cell volume ( after an osmotic upshift ) in Lactococcus lactis than in E. coli ( Mika et al., 2014 ). Fourth, the slowing of diffusion in metabolic energy-depleted cells suggests changes in the dynamic structure of the cytoplasm ( Parry et al., 2014; Joyner et al., 2016; Munder et al., 2016 )

. coli and L. lactis, which may titrate GFP away from its slower binding partner ( see proteome analysis below ). We also note that in Hfx. volcanii the diffusion coefficient of −30 GFP is higher than of −7 GFP, 10 µm2/s compared to 5. 5 µm2/s, which may be caused by a less negative binding partner for GFP in Hfx. volcanii than in E. coli. Next, we determined the diffusion coefficient of −30, –7, +15 and +25 GFP in E

. If +25 GFP were to bind some bigger complex, like β-galactosidase ( ~500 kDa ) with a diffusion coefficient of ~1 µm2/s, it would diffuse with a similar rate as β-galactosidase. Based on a census of elements present in E. coli cells this means that for +25 GFP to diffuse with a diffusion coefficient as low as 0. 14 µm2/s it needs to bind to membrane proteins, DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA complexes. For membrane proteins with 12–14 transmembrane helices in E. coli and L. lactis, D is 0

. For L. lactis the mean diffusion coefficient of −7 GFP ( 6. 2 µm2/s ) is lower than for E. coli ( 10 µm2/s ). However, in H. volcanii the diffusion of − GFP is faster than in E. coli ( 5. 5 µ2m/s vs 2.5 µ2/s ). The diffusion of − GFP in H. volcan is faster than in E coli due to electrostatic screening. The diffusion of − GFP in L. lact is slower than E coli due to electrostatic. The diffusion of − GFP in H. is faster than E coli due to electrostatic. The diffusion of GFP in L is slower than coli due electrostatic. The diffusion of GFP in H is faster than coli due electrostatic.

    Title: Tissue absence initiates regeneration through Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling
    Abstract: Regeneration is widespread, but mechanisms that activate regeneration remain mysterious. Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. A major question is how these distinct responses are activated. We describe a follistatin homolog ( Smed-follistatin ) required for planarian regeneration. Smed-follistatin inhibition blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs ( Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2 ) are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Finally, Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2012 ). How animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate these distinct wound response programs remains unknown. We identified Smed-follistatin as required for molecular and cellular ‘missing-tissue’ responses during regeneration. Specifically, Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling is required for regeneration to occur, with Smed-follistatin expression at wounds controlled by the extent of tissue absence following injury

. We identified a gene encoding a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor, follistatin, that is required for regeneration and for regeneration-specific cellular and molecular responses to injury. Our data suggest that inhibition of Activin signaling by Fst is required for initiating a regenerative response at wounds following major injury. Finally, fst is wound-induced, with the level of fst expression persisting at high levels longer following a major injury than following a simple injury

., 2007 ). Despite these contextual differences, TGF-β signaling plays a major role in many forms of regeneration studied. Therefore, uncovering ‘missing-tissue’ signals in planarians, describing how these signals interact with Activin signaling, and identifying the key factors regulated by these signals will inform a broad understanding of core regenerative mechanisms.

All long-living animals face the prospect of injury and require regenerative mechanisms. Planarians are an exceptional example of the regenerative potential of animals. Distinct cellular and molecular programs for responding to simple injury vs missing tissue exist in planarians. In the case of injuries involving substantial missing tissue, animals mount unique mitotic and apoptotic responses and produce an extended program of wound-induced gene expression ( Pellettieri et al

. We propose that wound-induced fst expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence. fst is the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. Not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following fst inhibition, however. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in fst ( RNAi ) animals, despite the absence of a normal proliferative response

. Because Follistatin proteins are well-characterized extracellular inhibitors of TGF-β ligands ( Nakamura et al., 1990; Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1994 ), we sought to identify putative TGF-β ligands that Smed-Follistatin might regulate to promote regeneration. Seven putative TGF-β superfamily members exist in the Schmidtea mediterranea genome ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Molina et al., 2007; Orii and Watanabe, 2007; Reddien et al., 2007; Gaviño and Reddien, 2011; Molina et al

To identify genes mediating regeneration-specific wound responses, we inhibited recently identified wound-induced genes ( Wenemoser et al., 2012 ) with RNA interference ( RNAi ). Inhibition of Smed-follistatin ( follistatin or fst ), a gene encoding a Follistatin-like TGF-β-superfamily inhibitor, completely blocked regeneration ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

. Therefore, some aspects of the missing-tissue response to injury require an as yet unknown ‘missing-tissue’ signal or signals that operate independently of fst and Activin signaling. Identifying and characterizing these processes will be important for understanding how the decision to mount a regenerative response occurs. Our findings describe a system in which suppression of Activin signaling is required for regeneration

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00247. 008 Planarians constantly maintain adult tissues through cell turnover involving neoblasts ( Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004 ). Consequently, most genes required for regeneration are also required for tissue turnover because of an involvement in neoblast biology ( Reddien et al., 2005 )

. Given that Follistatin proteins can directly regulate Activin proteins in other organisms ( Nakamura et al., 1990; Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1994 ), these data suggest that Follistatin promotes missing tissue responses by inhibiting the function of Activin proteins. 10. 7554/eLife. 00247. 013Figure 4. act-1 and act-2 are required for the fst RNAi phenotype

., 2007; Ho and Whitman, 2008 ), activin expression can be induced by wounding and exogenous TGF-β can speed healing in mammals ( Mustoe et al., 1987; Hübner et al., 1996; Sulyok et al., 2004 ), TGF-β signaling can promote regeneration following mouse ear hole-punching ( Liu et al., 2011 ), and wound-induced activin promotes cell proliferation and migration following zebrafish fin amputation ( Jaźwińska et al., 2007 )

. By contrast, RNAi of a different gene that blocked blastema formation ( smad1 ) did not block pharynx formation, indicating this defect is not a simple consequence of blastema formation failure ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). We conclude that fst is required broadly for missing-tissue-specific wound responses, and that these defects likely underlie the inability of fst ( RNAi ) animals to regenerate

. ( C ) act-1 ( RNAi ) animals displayed a greater induction of ovo+ eye progenitors compared to controls 2 days after head amputation ( n = 24, p<0. 0001, two-tailed t-test ). Scale bars = 100 µm.

The Smed-act-1 sequence was aligned with other TGF-β sequences using CLUSTALW ( Higgins, 1994; Thompson et al., 1994 )

. These data raise the possibility that act-1 regulates responses to injury, with some aspects of regeneration overactive following act-1 inhibition. Because fst is required for regeneration but not for normal tissue turnover, we reasoned that fst expression might be high following amputation, an injury type requiring significant tissue regeneration, but low following incision or puncture, injuries requiring only wound healing

. Planarians are flatworms capable of regeneration following an almost limitless variety of injuries and have emerged as a powerful model for exploring the molecular underpinnings of regeneration ( Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002 )

. We therefore assessed fst as compared to act expression at wounds following either incision or excision of a tissue wedge. Increased act-1 expression was not detected following either type of wound, with expression detected throughout the intestine of uninjured animals, suggesting an intestinal source of Activin-1 protein ( Figure 5A )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00247. 012 In addition to the cellular responses to missing tissue described above, persistence of wound-induced gene expression is another aspect of the planarian missing-tissue response ( Wenemoser et al., 2012 ). We observed less expression of two wound-response genes in fst ( RNAi ) animals than in controls 24–48 hr post-amputation, despite expression levels being indistinguishable at earlier timepoints ( Figure 3C )

. 01, white arrowheads = injury site ). ( D ) A proposed genetic model for fst and act-1/2 in regeneration. Wounds induce fst expression. If there is missing tissue following injury, fst induction is high, Act-1/2 signaling is inhibited, and regeneration-specific responses are initiated. If there is no missing tissue following injury, fst expression is low, Act-1/2 signaling is not inhibited, and regeneration-specific responses are repressed. Scale bars = 100 µm. Anterior up

. Together, these data are consistent with a model in which wound-induced fst expression levels are regulated by the amount of missing tissue. In this model, fst promotes regenerative responses by inhibition of act-1 and act-2 following major injury ( Figure 5D ). 10. 755/eLife.002.012  Figure 5—figure supplement 1. act-1 and act-2 are required for the fst RNA phenotype. doi. org/ 10.755/e.002 47.012

The final answer is: 

In a study published in eLife, researchers identified a gene called S-follatin that is required for regeneration in planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow its body parts. Sollatin inhibits activin signaling, a protein involved in tissue growth and development. The study found that Soll is expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue loss, but not those that do not. This suggests that Soll promotes regeneration by inhibiting activin. The researchers also found that two activin homologs, S-activ-1 and S-activ-2, are required for Soll phenotype. This is the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. The study identifies a mechanism for regeneration that is important across the animal kingdom.

    Title: Mismatch repair deficiency endows tumors with a unique mutation signature and sensitivity to DNA double-strand breaks
    Abstract: DNA replication errors that persist as mismatch mutations make up the molecular fingerprint of mismatch repair ( MMR ) -deficient tumors and convey them with resistance to standard therapy. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability ( MSI ). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the ‘DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination’ pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers.

., 2012; Peltomaki, 2014 ). Deficiency of the MMR machinery leads to DNA replication errors in the tumor tissue, but not the normal surrounding tissue. In particular, errors often accumulate as indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats—a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability ( MSI ) ( Pinol et al., 2005 ). MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a different prognosis and therapeutic outcome after standard chemotherapy ( Ng and Schrag, 2010 )

. To generate a more comprehensive picture of the mutation spectra arising in MMR-deficient tumors, and in particular, to interpret their clinical relevance with respect to diagnostically assessing MSI and therapeutically targeting MMR-deficient tumors, we sequenced another comprehensive set of MMR-deficient tumors. In particular, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing was applied to 5 and 28 tumor–normal pairs, of which respectively 3 and 22 were MMR-deficient.

. 0% of the indels identified here validated favorably using orthogonal technologies. When focusing on the clinical relevance of indel mutation patterns to diagnose MSI, we observed that indels specifically affected homopolymer stretches, which is relevant as the extended Bethesda panel consists of eight microsatellite and only two homopolymer markers and possibly therefore has only limited sensitivity relative to IHC ( ∼75% for both EM and CRC tumors [Hampel et al., 2005, 2006, 2008] )

. Exome-sequencing of tumor and matched germ-line DNA at an average coverage of 44x revealed that each MMR-deficient tumor contained ∼2015 somatic events vs 39 for MMR-proficient tumors ( 52-fold increase; Figure 4A, Figure 4—source data 1, Figure 4—source data 2 ). Validation rates for substitutions and indels were respectively 87% and 86%

. Indels mainly affected homopolymers ( 59. 0% ), whereas microsatellites and short homopolymers were affected at a frequency that was expected based on their genome-wide occurrence. In contrast, indels were depleted in non-repeat regions. Substitutions affected the exome independent of repeat composition. These distributions mirror our observations in the MMR-deficient tumors undergoing whole-genome sequencing. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02725. 02410. 7554/eLife

Here, we surveyed whole-genomes of MMR-deficient tumors to provide a comprehensive picture of the mutations associated with human MMR-deficiency. With respect to somatic substitutions, we observed that the majority represented transitions and not transversions, and that adjacent nucleotides and various genomic features had an important context-dependent effect on determining which nucleotides were affected

. More recently, the first whole-exome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors was performed, highlighting the clearly distinct mutational landscape of these tumors ( TCGA, 2012 ), whereas at the whole-genome level, Kim et al. ( 2013 ) revealed overrepresentation of MSI in euchromatic and intronic regions compared to heterochromatic and intergenic regions

. The 13 MMR-deficient whole-exomes and whole-exome data extracted from 3 MMR-deficient whole-genomes were screened for recurrent mutations. Random selection and validation of 24 indels occurring in 6 or more samples revealed a validation rate of 100%. Given the high validation rate for somatic indels per se, and the even higher rate for recurrent indels, we considered all recurrent indels as true-positives

( B ) The fraction of indels and substitutions observed in microsatellites, homopolymers ( length over 5 bp ), short homopolymers ( length of 3–5 bp ), and ‘not in repeat regions’ compared to their expected fraction in these regions

. All tumors with less than three positive markers were thus considered MSS/MSI-L. For the Bethesda panel, we defined three categories as follows: microsatellite stable ( MSS, 0 out of 10 markers ), low microsatellite instability ( MSI-L, 1–2 out of 10 markers ), and high microsatellite instability ( MSI-H, 3 or more out of 10 markers ). Two sets of data ( 114 EM tumors and 97 CRC tumors ) were used for the comparison. Details of these sample sets are given in Figure 5—source data 1

. At the small-scale level, when assessing the effect of flanking nucleotides on substitution frequencies, the patterns of all four sets of germ-line genetic variants were highly correlated to MMR-deficient tumors ( average R2 = 0. 77 ), but less to the four other cancer genomes ( average R2 = 0. 45; Figure 2B, C ), providing further support for our hypothesis

. Different sequencing technologies were leveraged to avoid potential technology biases in assessing mutation patterns in MMR-deficient tumor genomes, that is, Complete Genomics ( CG ) and Illumina short-read sequencing. We obtained high coverage sequencing data ( 30–120x ) for tumor and matched normal samples ( Table 1 ). Application of a standard annotation and filtering pipeline, as previously described ( Reumers et al

. Due to their length and variability, these markers are notoriously difficult to analyze and interpret. As a consequence, the Bethesda panel has reduced sensitivity to detect MSI. In an effort to improve MSI testing, we randomly selected 59 recurrent indels affecting ≥6 out of 16 tumors; 50 markers were in 5′ or 3′UTRs and 9 were in coding regions ( Figure 5—source data 1 ). Furthermore, each of the markers was detected in both MMR-deficient EM and CRC

. Given these remarkable parallels, we hypothesized that MMR-deficient genomes hypermutate in a way that mirrors the processes driving genetic variation on a population level, albeit somatically and on a shorter time scale. 10. 7554/eLife. 02725. 011Figure 2. Somatic substitution patterns in MMR-deficient tumors

To select MMR-deficient tumors for MSI testing, we used immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) of M proteins MLH, MSH, and MSH and methylation of the ML1 promoter. IHC was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue sections of tumors. Methylation of the ML1 promoter was assessed using methylation-specific PCR ( MSP ) of genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue. IHC and MSP were performed as previously described (Pomaki et al. 2012, 2014 ). For MSI testing, we used the extended Bethesda panel of 10 microsatellite markers ( Table 1 ). MSI was defined as 3 or more out of 10 markers showing instability. MSI-L was defined as 1–2 out of 10 markers unstable and MSS as 0 out of 10 stable. MSI-H was defined as 3 or more markers unstable. MSI-L was defined as 1–2 unstable and MSS as 0 stable. MSI-H was defined 3 or unstable. MSI-L was 1– unstable and MSS was 0. MSI-H was 3 unstable. MSI-L was 1 and MSS was 0. MSI-H was 3.

    Title: Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets photodimerizers for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells
    Abstract: Light-inducible dimerization protein modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in non-invasive fashion. Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28°C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these ‘enhanced’ Magnets ( eMags ) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.

    Supporting Text:
   . The Magnets pair was engineered from the Vivid homodimer by introducing complementary charges, giving rise to nMag ( negative Magnet ) and pMag ( positive Magnet ). The two Magnets components are quite small ( 150 aa ) for photodimerizers, exhibit relatively fast association and dissociation kinetics, and function when fused to a broad range of proteins, including peripheral and intrinsic membrane proteins ( Benedetti et al., 2018; Kawano et al., 2016; Kawano et al., 2015 )

. The resulting reagents, ‘enhanced Magnets’ ( eMags ), have greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. We confirmed their effectiveness in a variety of applications including protein recruitment to different organelles, the generation/expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers that have key regulatory functions in lipid transport.

., 2017; Kawano et al., 2015 ). A pair with greater dimerization efficiency would be desirable, ideally allowing single copies of the complementary Magnets to suffice. With the goal of engineering such a pair, we first established a robust screen for reconstitution of Magnets dimerization using light-dependent accumulation of a protein at the outer mitochondrial membrane ( Benedetti et al., 2018; Figure 1A ), which is readily visible and quantifiable

. Next, we began the process of Magnets redesign by optimizing the placement of charge-complementing amino acids in the Vivid dimer interface, using the crystal structure of the light-activated dimer ( PDB ID 3RH8 ) ( Vaidya et al., 2011; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C ) as a guide, and mitochondrial recruitment as the testbed

., 2015 ), offers major advantages over other systems in several different assays. Magnets have rapid association and dissociation kinetics and require both monomers to undergo blue-light activation to permit dimerization. These properties make the background activation of Magnets low, so that they are well-suited to optogenetic modulation of small volumes and sub-cellular organelles

., 2017; Kawano et al., 2015 ), which may affect trafficking, motility and function of target proteins, create vector payload constraints, and give rise to recombination and/or silencing of the sequence repeats. Here, we overcome these limitations of the Magnets by structure-guided protein engineering and validation by cellular assays

. However, the existing Magnets tools have two critical disadvantages, which preclude their wider adoption: ( 1 ) their weak dimerization efficiency necessitates the use of concatemers, which can perturb target proteins and slow kinetics, and ( 2 ) the low thermodynamic stability means that expression and maturation must occur at reduced temperatures, complicating cell-culture experiments and ruling out mammalian in vivo work entirely

., 2017; Taslimi et al., 2016 ). One popular photodimerizer pair is ‘Magnets’, engineered from the Neurospora crassa Vivid photoreceptor, which comprises an N-terminal Ncap domain responsible for homodimerization and a C-terminal light-oxygen-voltage-sensing ( LOV ) domain ( Kawano et al., 2015 ). Magnets employ the ubiquitous cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) as the light-sensing moiety

. Importantly, excitation light for TagRFP-T, as well as that for mCherry and the infrared fluorescent protein iRFP ( Shcherbakova and Verkhusha, 2013 ), is well outside the action spectrum of LOV domain proteins ( 400–500 nm light excitation ) ( Losi et al., 2018 ) ; EGFP excitation light is coincident with Magnets activation and is thus used sparingly in these experiments

In this work, we have both engineered a dramatically improved photodimerizer pair and used it in a set of experiments elucidating details of organellar interactions and cellular lipid metabolism and transport. In a previous study ( Benedetti et al., 2018 ), we had compared multiple optogenetic dimerizer reagents and found that the Magnets system, based on orthogonalization of the Vivid LOV domain homodimer ( Kawano et al

. First, the low thermodynamic stability of the Magnets components precludes their proper expression and folding at 37°C. Thus, they cannot be used in mammals. When used in cultured mammalian cells they require a preincubation at low temperature ( 28°C ) for 12 hr to allow expression and folding. Second, as the Magnets components heterodimerize with low efficiency, robust activation requires concatemerization ( Furuya et al., 2017; Kawano et al

., 2016; Kawano et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, heterodimerization of Magnets requires light-dependent activation of both components, rather than just one. This property results in low levels of background activity and allows induction of dimer formation with single-wavelength excitation in small cytoplasmic volumes ( Benedetti et al., 2018 ). However, the Magnets system has two prominent shortcomings

. Relative to the original Magnets – which we systematically compared to Cry2/CIB1 and iLIDs in our previous study – eMags shows significant improvements in the dimerization efficiency, and association and dissociation kinetics. Taken together, eMags provides several advantages over Cry2/CIB1 and iLIDs for subcellular optogenetics and perhaps other settings as well. We have shown the benefits of the faster eMagsF clones for rapid manipulation

. After several rounds of mutagenesis and screening, we selected final ‘enhanced Magnets’ ( eMag ) variants with nine mutations over the starting scaffolds. The eMag reagents showed greater dimerization efficiency – allowing use as monomers instead of concatemers, full function after their folding and maturation at 37°C, and faster association and dissociation kinetics than the original Magnets. We recently compared ( Benedetti et al

. Conditional induction or expansion of such contacts may help elucidate the contribution of inter-organelle contacts and signaling to a variety of biochemical pathways. We first designed a light-inducible ER-lysosome tethering system. Using the targeting sequences above ( Figure 2 ), ER-mCherry-eMagA and Lys-eMagB-iRFP were co-transfected into COS7 cells. Before blue light activation, ER-lysosome overlap, as detected by mCherry and iRFP overlap, was minimal ( Figure 3B ) ; during 1 min

., 2018; Rost et al., 2017 ). Light offers much greater spatial and temporal resolution than drugs, and as such, optogenetic dimerizers are generally used to probe phenomena at cellular and subcellular scales. At the organism scale, light is much less invasive but suffers from penetration issues. Photodimerizers have been successfully used to manipulate a variety of cellular processes, including signaling networks ( Gasser et al., 2014; Grusch et al., 2014; Guglielmi et al

. We thoroughly validated the eMags constructs in a range of cellular assays both in whole cell and local irradiation conditions involving protein recruitment to different membranes, inter-organellar association, and bilayer lipid metabolism and trafficking. The success of the engineering effort validates the design strategy and shows that many mutations from thermophilic fungi grafted well to the scaffold of the Vivid photoreceptor of Neurospora crassa, a mesophilic fungus

. Mutations of Asn133 to lysine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine ( the latter two from thermophiles ) both enhanced dimerization at 33°C, with Asn133Phe and Asn133Tyr facilitating dimerization at 37°C ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). We also found that mutations at the C-terminus improved dimerization at 37 ( Figure 1— supplement 1B ). These mutations were incorporated into the final eMag scaffold to create eMag. The eMag showed dimerization at 37°C without preincubation ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ) and association and dissociation kinetics faster than the original Magnets ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ).

    Title: Activation of GCN2 kinase by ribosome stalling links translation elongation with translation initiation
    Abstract: Ribosome stalling during translation has recently been shown to cause neurodegeneration, yet the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. To investigate these pathways we analyzed the brain of C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α ( Ser51 ) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2015 ). Here, we take advantage of unique mouse models with the Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutation to assess the signaling events that are triggered by ribosome stalling. We show that GCN2 is activated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutant brain in a tRNAdeacyl-independent manner prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice

. Further, our genetic studies demonstrate that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.

Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration of these cells, but the signaling pathways evoked by these complexes are unknown. Here we show that GCN2 activates the integrated stress response in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, clearly demonstrating an important feedback loop between elongation defects, in particular ribosome stalling, and translation initiation

. Furthermore in the hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/-mice, we observed degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells that is not observed in B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-, suggesting the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for survival of these neurons during ribosome stalling

. Finally, ATF4 activation also occurs in the brains of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which the n-Tr20 is entirely deleted and thus no unprocessed tRNA is produced. These results raise the intriguing possibility that ribosome stalling may also contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation, in which like B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- neurons, lower levels of acylated tRNA are present. The exact mechanism for GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear

. Several of these genes were also upregulated, albeit at lower levels, in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum suggesting that neurons may sense a deficiency of functional ribosomes and correspondingly activate genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. The failure to decrease protein synthesis via GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation may result in a further depletion of functional ribosomes necessitating additional compensatory increases in expression of genes controlling nucleolar function

. Loss of Gcn2 in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum not only resulted in reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation and attenuated upregulation of ATF4 target genes, but also caused increased expression of genes that regulate nucleolar function, including those involved in ribosome biogenesis and processing of non-coding RNAs

. The effects of GCN2-ATF4 pathway on cell survival vary in an apparently context-dependent manner. To determine the effect of GCN2-ATF4 pathway on the progression of neurodegeneration induced by ribosome stalling, we compared locomotion and cerebellar pathology in B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. As expected, B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice exhibited mild ataxia and tremors at 45 days of age, and no motor defects were observed in B6J. Gcn2-/- or B6J mice

. Neither Xbp1 splicing nor BiP levels were upregulated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and data not shown ) suggesting eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 activation was regulated by a eIF2α kinase other than PERK. The eIF2α kinase GCN2 is activated by amino acid deprivation and other conditions that increase levels of uncharged tRNAs. Amino acid deprivation would be expected to also result in ribosome stalling

. ( A ) To segregate genes associated with ribosome stalling from genes nonspecifically induced during neurodegeneration, microarray analysis was performed on the cerebellum ( Cb ) and hippocampus ( Hp ) from B6J and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- ( B6J-nmf205-/- ) mice at 3-weeks ( 3W ) and 5-weeks ( 5W ) of age. ( B ) Enriched pathways among genes that were up or downregulated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain were obtained by Kegg pathway analysis

., 2014 ). In this mouse model, two mutations are necessary to induce neuron loss: a loss of function mutation ( Gtpbp2nmf205-/- ) in a translational GTPase GTPBP2 ( guanosine triphosphate-binding protein 2 ) and a hypomorphic mutation in the nervous system-specific n-Tr20 ( nTRtct5 ) tRNAArgUCU gene. Ribosomal profiling of cerebella from mice with the n-Tr20 mutation revealed an increase in ribosome occupancy at AGA codons that dramatically increased in the absence of GTPBP2

. However, recent findings have shown that cellular stress can cause downregulation of global translation during cellular stress independently of eIF2α phosphorylation ( Knutsen et al., 2015 ), raising the possibility that eIF2α is not necessarily directly causative in ameliorating neuron death in the B6J- Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain

. Consistent with this result, upstream regulator analysis of differentially expressed genes in the mutant brain demonstrated enrichment for EIF2AK3 ( PERK ), an eIF2α kinase, and its downstream effector, activating transcription factor 4 ( ATF4 ), a key component of the integrated stress response and activator of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and amino acid metabolic pathways ( Figure 1C and Figure 1—source data 2 )

. Thus, we examined the eIF2α phosphorylation status in the cerebellar extracts of 3-week-old B6J, B6J. B6Nn-Tr20 ( B6J mice in which the wild-type n-Tr20 gene was transferred to B6J by repeated backcrossing ), and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice by Western blot analysis ( Figure 3A ). Consistent with our ribosome occupancy studies at AGA codons ( Ishimura et al., 2014 ), the ratio of p-eIF2α to total eIF2α was significantly higher in the B6J cerebellum relative to the B6J

., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Shalgi et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, misregulation of elongation may contribute to disease pathology resulting in neurological dysfunction such as observed in Fragile X syndrome ( Chen et al., 2014; Darnell et al., 2011; Udagawa et al., 2013 ). Recently we reported that ribosome stalling is intimately associated with cerebellar and retinal degeneration in the C57BL6/J ( B6J ) -nmf205 mutant mouse ( Ishimura et al., 2014 )

To begin to elucidate the molecular pathways activated by ribosome stalling, we performed gene expression studies on cerebella isolated from B6J ( n-Tr20, also known as nTRtct5, mutant ) and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- ( n-Tr20 mutant; Gtpbp2nmf205-/- ) mice at 5 weeks of age, a time when many granule cells are undergoing apoptosis in the cerebellum of B6-Gbpnm205- mice ( Ishura et al, 2014 ). Microarray analysis of the cereella from B6 and B6-Gbpnm-205 mice at 3 and 5 weeks of age revealed that genes involved in the integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway were upregulated in the cerebella of B-Gnm205 mice ( Figure 1 and Figure 1— data 2 ). The ISR pathway is activated by phosphorylation of eIFα at Ser51 by GC2, an eIFα kinase that also activated by amino acid deprivation and other conditions that increase levels of uncharged tRNAs ( Figure 1C and Figure 1— data 2 )

    Title: A century of trends in adult human height
    Abstract: Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education and earnings. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18. 6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20. 2 cm ( 95% credible interval 17. 5–22. 7 ) and 16. 5 cm ( 13. 3–19. 7 ) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182. 5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 ( 140. 3 cm; 135. 8–144. 8 ). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.

. The rise is continuing in other East and Southeast Asian countries like China and Thailand, with Chinese men and women having surpassed the Japanese ( but not yet as tall as South Koreans ). The rise in adult height also seems to have plateaued in South Asian countries like Bangladesh and India at much lower levels than in East Asia, e. g., 5–10 cm shorter than it did in Japan and South Korea. 10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 008Figure 6

. Less has been known about trends in women’s height, and those in non-English-speaking/non-European parts of the world. We found that some of the most important changes in height have happened in these under-investigated populations. In particular, South Korean and Japanese men and women, and Iranian men, have had larger gains than European men, and similar trends are now happening in China and Thailand

. Australia was the only non-European country where men born in 1996 were among the 25 tallest in the world. Women born in 1996 are shortest in Guatemala, with an average height of 149. 4 cm ( 148. 0–150. 8 ), and are shorter than 151 cm in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepal. The tallest women live in Latvia, the Netherlands, Estonia and Czech Republic, with average height surpassing 168 cm, creating a 20 cm global gap in women’s height ( Figure 5 )

We estimated trends in mean height for adults born from 1896 to 1996 ( i. e., people who had reached their 18th birthday from 1914 to 2014 ) in 200 countries and territories. Countries were organized into 20 regions, mostly based on a combination of geography and national income ( Supplementary file 1 ). Our study had two steps, described below. First, we identified, accessed, and re-analysed population-based measurement studies of human anthropometry

More recently, the same seems to have happened for men, but not women, in some countries in Central Asia ( e. g

. Male and female heights were correlated across countries in 1896 as well as in 1996. Men were taller than women in every country, on average by ~11 cm in the 1896 birth cohort and ~12 cm in the 1996 birth cohort ( Figure 9 ). In the 1896 birth cohort, the male-female height gap in countries where average height was low was slightly larger than in taller nations

As a result, South Korean women moved from the fifth shortest to the top tertile of tallest women in the world over the course of a century. Men in South Korea also had large gains relative to other countries, by 15. 2 cm ( 12. 3–18. 1 ). There were also large gains in height in Japan, Greenland, some countries in Southern Europe ( e. g., Greece ) and Central Europe ( e. g

Researchers investigated the brain regions and cells responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression, a major cause of opioid overdose deaths in the US. They found that two brainstem areas, the pre-Bötzinger Complex (preBöt) and the Parabrachial Nucleus (PBNF), mediate this effect, with the preöt being the primary site. Using genetic tools, they identified 70-140 neurons in the preöt responsible for sensitivity to opioids, which can be targeted to prevent respiratory depression without affecting analgesia. Opioids act by silencing presynaptic release, removing these neurons from the network. The µ-opi receptor is expressed in both central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that modulate breathing such as the cortex, brainstem control centers, primary neurons, and sensing afferents. Deleting µ-opi receptor from both sites eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even at high doses of fentanyl. Targeting these two sites is sufficient to rescue respiratory depression.

    Title: Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus
    Abstract: Human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor ( s ) binding. However, the identity of the receptor ( s ) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.

   ., 2010 ). In the current study, by using a synthetic modified peptide originating from the native aa 2–48 lipopeptide ( Myr-47/WT ) as a probe and employing a series of biochemical approaches and virological assays, we identified and confirmed that sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ), a multiple transmembrane transporter mainly expressed in the liver, interacts specifically with the L proteins of HBV and HDV and functions as a common receptor for both viruses.

. The pre-S1 domain of the L protein is a key determinant for entry of both HBV and HDV and is believed to mediate viral interaction with the cellular receptor ( s ) on hepatocytes ( Gripon et al., 1995; Le Seyec et al., 1999; Chouteau et al., 2001; Blanchet and Sureau, 2007; Le Duff et al., 2009 ). Although a number of HBV receptor candidates have been reported in the past, none has been confirmed to be functional in supporting viral infection ( Glebe and Urban, 2007 ). 10

. Similar to HDV, HBV infection was also abolished on HepG2 cells expressing hNTCP carrying monkey-like mutations, GRIILSLVP, while mkNTCP-bearing human residues KGIVISLVL within the motif of aa 157–165 largely restored HBV infection ( Figure 7C ). These data show that residues between 157 and 165 of NTCP are crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the L protein of HBV, and critically contribute to NTCP-mediated HBV and HDV infections. 10. 7554/eLife

. Identification of cellular receptor ( s ) of HBV and HDV has been challenging. In our study, we utilized a short peptide ligand, WTb, which was originated from the known receptor-binding domain of the L protein ( Barrera et al., 2005; Glebe et al., 2005; Gripon et al., 2005; Engelke et al., 2006; Schulze et al., 2010 ), but with specially designed properties suitable for photo-cross-linking and tandem purification

. Strikingly, despite the high level of protein sequence homology between human and monkey NTCP, the later did not support HBV and HDV infection. Replacing a small motif of aa 157–165 of mkNTCP with the corresponding hNTCP residues converted mkNTCP to a receptor for pre-S1 binding as well as HDV and HBV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine if and how NTCP contributes to the species specificity of HDV and HBV infection in other species

. The authentic viral infections in cells complemented with NTCP were shown by the kinetic analyses of several markers of viral infections, in particular the quantification of newly synthesized viral replicative intermediates. Moreover, the NTCP-rendered infections were blocked by known entry inhibitors. NTCP residues 157 to 165 were identified to be critical for pre-S1 binding and viral infections. These data clearly demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV

. The newly discovered role of NTCP as an entry receptor for HBV and HDV raises interesting questions regarding its involvement in viral pathogenesis. Identification of NTCP as a functional receptor for HBV and HDV advances our understanding of their entry into host cells and may lead to new prevention and treatment strategies against these viruses and related diseases.

., 2005; Hu et al., 2011 ). It is mainly expressed in the liver ( Stieger, 2011 ), consistent with the liver tropism of HBV and HDV. NTCP localizes to the sinusoidal ( basolateral ) plasma membrane of hepatocytes ( Stieger et al., 1994 ), a location that fits well with its receptor role for blood-borne HBV and HDV. Whereas HBV first attaches to hepatocytes mainly through heparan sulfate ( Schulze et al., 2007; Leistner et al

In this study, by employing a unique approach of tandem affinity purification combined with MS analysis against a Tupaia hepatocyte proteome database established by deep sequencing, we revealed that the liver bile acid transporter, NTCP, specifically interacts with a key region in the pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope L protein

. It also remains to be determined if other molecule ( s ) additional to NTCP contributes to the cellular entry of HBV and/or HDV as a coreceptor ( s ) or receptor component ( s ), and if other host factors such as the microenvironment or architecture of hepatocytes in liver, or soluble blood components like those that have been shown to involve in infections of other viruses ( Shayakhmetov et al., 2005; Morizono et al., 2011 ), contribute to HBV and/or HD entry.

    Title: Sepsis leads to lasting changes in phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells
    Abstract: The global health burden due to sepsis and the associated cytokine storm is substantial. While early intervention has improved survival during the cytokine storm, those that survive can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis defined by transient lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving cells. Memory CD8 T cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production following re-encounter with their cognate antigen to promote long-term immunity, and CD8 T cell impairment due to sepsis can pre-dispose individuals to re-infection. While the acute influence of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells has been characterized, if and to what extent pre-existing memory CD8 T cells recover remains unknown. Here, we observed that central memory CD8 T cells ( TCM ) from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Utilizing LCMV immune mice and a CLP model to induce sepsis, we demonstrated that TCM proliferation is associated with numerical recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells following sepsis-induced lymphopenia. This increased proliferation leads to changes in composition of memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. Further, memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. The sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminated in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control L. monocytogenes infection. Thus, sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function and localization potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection.

    Supporting Text:
    In the present study, we demonstrate that sepsis leads to a lasting change in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment in the sepsis survivors. This occurs as a result of proliferation in the lymphopenic environment that occurs after sepsis, seen in both patients and mice, wherein TCM have higher proliferative capacity than TEM. This biasing toward TCM alters the localization of memory CD8 T cells

. When the number of memory P14 CD8 T cells per mL of blood was quantified, we observed numeric loss and recovery of P14 CD8 T cells in CLP hosts ( Figure 2f ), similar to prior reports of homeostatic proliferation following sepsis-induced lymphopenia ( Unsinger et al., 2009 ). Thus, pre-existing memory CD8 T cells numerically recover with time after sepsis, potentially due to increased proliferation in response to the sepsis-induced lymphopenic environment

. Cumulatively, the data in Figure 4 demonstrate that preferential proliferation by TCM alters the composition and localization of pre-existing memory CD8 T cells after sepsis. Thus, pre-existing differences in the biology of central and effector memory T cells are the underlying mechanism by which central memory CD8 T cells become over-represented in pre-existing memory populations after sepsis

. This reinforces our observation of sepsis accelerating the adoption of time-dependent changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool. To address the putative functional alterations resulting from sepsis-induced changes in the memory CD8 T cell pool, the capacity of memory P14 CD8 T cells to undergo TCR-dependent adhesion and immunologic synapse formation >30 days after either Sham or CLP surgery was assessed ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1a )

. Here, using samples from septic patients and well described experimental models we demonstrate increased proliferation of CD8 T cells ( particularly central memory cells [TCM] ) in septic patients and mice after cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) -induced sepsis, relative to non-septic controls. As a consequence of this increased proliferation, there is a remodeling of the memory CD8 T cell pool

., 2009; White et al., 2017 ). Thus, it may be relevant to consider how the proliferation of these cells also alter the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment and shapes host response to subsequent infection for which they may be specific. Our novel characterization of how numeric recovery in the lymphopenic environment alters the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment demonstrates how sepsis can lead to lasting changes in host immunity

. Further, the memory CD8 T cell pool has an altered transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility, which is associated both with the transition toward TCM and functional alterations. The culmination of these sepsis-induced changes alters the function of the memory CD8 T cells and reduces their capacity to control virulent L. m. infection

. m. infection. Thus, our data cumulatively demonstrate how sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the pre-existing memory CD8 T cells alters the functional capability of the memory CD8 T cell population as a whole, thereby altering the host response to infection.

., 2018a ). In particular, deficits in existing memory CD8 T cells can enhance host susceptibility to pathogens against which the host was previously immune or vaccinated. To understand how CD8 T cells respond to septic insult and the lymphopenic state, septic patients were recruited within 24 hr of admission and the frequency and number of CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood were compared to that of healthy controls

. Thus, novel transcriptional changes also arise in memory CD8 T cells during the post-septic environment. Summarily, these data demonstrate that sepsis leads to lasting changes in the transcriptional landscape of memory CD8 T cells. These changes are associated with the more rapid acquisition of time-dependent changes by memory CD8 T cells in CLP hosts, a sepsis-induced transcriptional scar, and novel transcriptional changes acquired in the post-septic environment

The sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state poses a substantial threat to the health and long-term survival of septic patients ( Delano and Ward, 2016a; Delano and Ward, 2016b; Dombrovskiy et al., 2007; Donnelly et al., 2015 ). A major contributing factor to sepsis-induced immunoparalysis is the intrinsic and numerical deficits imposed on naive and memory CD8 T cells ( Jensen et al., 2018a )

., 2017; Strother et al., 2016 ). We and others have characterized numerous impairments early after sepsis induction; however, the extent to which those cell populations recover in number and function remains largely unknown. Specifically, sepsis-induced lymphopenia impacts both memory and naïve CD8 T cells early after sepsis ( Condotta et al., 2015; Condotta et al., 2013; Duong et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2018a; Markwart et al., 2014 )

. Importantly, when evaluating the representation of CD8 T cell subsets among Ki67-expressing CD8 T cells, TCM and TSCM CD8 T cells were not proportionally increased ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ), with TCM being the most prominent among cells that recently proliferated. Collectively, these data suggest that sepsis may alter the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment due to intrinsic differences in the capacity of different memory CD8 T cell subsets to proliferate

. Notably, there was not a significant increase in Ki67+ TEM CD8 T cells from septic patients ( Figure 1e ). These data suggest that there is differential proliferation by memory CD8 T cell subsets in septic hosts. Given this differential proliferation by memory CD8 T cell subsets, an altered composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool would be anticipated after sepsis

., 2020 ). Therefore, to address how the sepsis-induced changes in the composition of pre-existing memory CD8 T cells may alter the overall transcriptional regulation of memory CD8 T cells RNA-sequencing was performed on memory P14 CD8 T cells from Sham and CLP hosts both 1- and 31 days post-surgery ( Figure 5a ). Numerous transcriptional differences between the four groups were identified ( Figure 5b–d )

. This reduction may culminate in a more rapid waning of lung TRM and reinforce susceptibility to previously encountered infections. Moreover, the detrimental effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells may also be relevant to other major inflammatory events and poorly controlled infections ( e. g. SARS-CoV-2 ) and should be considerations in the long-term consequences for similarly impacted individuals ( Li et al., 2020; Sariol and Perlman, 2020 )

. To further address how sepsis may alter the composition of the CD8 T cell compartment due to differential capacity memory CD8 T cell subsets to sense signals of the ‘empty’ environment and undergo homeostatic proliferation, we utilized a murine LCMV-infection model to establish memory CD8 T cells followed by a cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP; Figure 2a ). To facilitate resolution/analyses of the memory CD8 T cell compartment a physiologically relevant number of naïve Thy1

. Additionally, there was induction of Ki67 expression by memory P14 CD8 T cells after sepsis ( Figure 2d and e ), demonstrating that memory CD8 cells proliferate in response to seps-induced lymphopenia. This is consistent with prior reports of homeostatic proliferation following seps-induced lymphopenia (Unsinger et al.,2009 ). Thus pre-existing memory CD8 cells numerically recover with time after seps, potentially due to increased proliferation in response the seps-induced lymphic environment

In this study, we demonstrate that seps leads to lasting changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T compartment in seps survivors. This occurs as a result of proliferation in lymphic environment that occurs seps, in both patients and mice, wherein TCM have higher proliferative capacity than TEM. This bias toward T alters localization of memory CD T cells. When the number memory14 CD8 T per mL of blood was quantified we observed loss and recovery of14 CD T in CL hosts ( Figure 2 ) similar prior reports homeostatic proliferation seps-induced lymphia (Unsinger et al,2009 ) Thus pre-existing CD T numerically recover with time after seps, potentially due increased in response seps-induced lymphic environment.

    Title: APOBEC3A deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA during LINE-1 retrotransposition
    Abstract: Long INterspersed Element-1 ( LINE-1 or L1 ) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition. The APOBEC3 ( A3 ) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides ( C-to-U ) in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A ( A3A ) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.

    Supporting Text:
   . We further demonstrate that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein ( UGI ) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. Together, these data indicate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration

. Previous studies revealed that over-expression of the wild-type ( WT ) APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase protein ( A3A ), but not deaminase-defective A3A mutants, could potently inhibit L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells ( Chen et al., 2006; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007; Niewiadomska et al., 2007 ). However, deamination events were not detected in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of WT A3A ( Chen et al

., 2006; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007 ). Thus, the molecular mechanism by which WT A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained a mystery. Here, we employ an in vitro assay ( L1 Element Amplification Protocol or LEAP ) that recapitulates the first strand cDNA synthesis step of the L1 integration to elucidate a mechanism for A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition

. Degradation of deaminated retrotransposition intermediates would reduce L1 retrotransposition levels in cultured cell assays and could, in principle, eliminate evidence of A3A-mediated deamination events in the resultant retrotransposed L1 sequences. Such a scenario could explain why previous studies failed to detect A3A-mediated deamination events in engineered L1 retrotransposition events ( Chen et al., 2006; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007 )

. Deamination of single-strand genomic DNA in the pre-integration site ( red rectangle ) leads to inexact TSDs in the post-integration site ( red lettering/rectangles ). ( E ) Stable UGI expression alleviates A3A-mediated L1 inhibition: The x-axis indicates the U2OS cell line. The y-axis depicts the efficiency of L1 retrotransposition. Shown are the effects of wild-type A3A ( white bars ), A3A-C106S ( gray bars ), and β-arrestin ( β-arr, black bars ) control on L1 retrotransposition

We propose a straightforward model for how A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition ( Figure 4 ). In the presence of cellular RNase H, the ( − ) strand L1 cDNA becomes vulnerable to A3A deamination ( Figure 4A ). Normally, these events would be repaired by combined actions of UNG and APE, which we speculate could lead to the integration of a 5′ truncated L1 cDNA that lacks evidence of deamination

We used a cultured cell assay ( Moran et al., 1996; Wei et al., 2000 ) to determine the extent to which A3A inhibits retrotransposition of LINE elements that differ significantly in their nucleotide sequence and structure ( Figure 1A ). The retrotransposition indicator cassette mneoI ( Freeman et al., 1994; Moran et al., 1996 ) was used to tag the 3′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) of a human L1 ( pJM101/L1. 3 ) ( Sassaman et al

. Moreover, some L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A and UGI lacked evidence of deamination. Why and how some L1 retrotransposition events evade A3A-mediated deamination requires further study. However, it is possible that ectopic A3A expression is too low to efficiently target L1 TPRT intermediates in some cells or that L1 second-strand cDNA synthesis occasionally is completed before A3A can gain access to TPRT intermediates to deaminate single-strand L1 cDNAs

. In contrast, characterization of 33 L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A revealed 39 G-to-A mutations ( Figure 3F, bottom panel, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). The A3A-induced mutations occurred in a strand-specific manner ( i. e., we only detected one C-to-T mutation on the L1 coding strand ), and far outnumbered any other nucleotide changes in retrotransposed products. Notably, one mutation ( pJM140/L1

. In addition to canonical TPRT, human L1s can mobilize by an alternative, endonuclease-independent retrotransposition mechanism ( ENi ) in cells that lack p53 activity and are defective for components of the non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) DNA repair machinery ( Morrish et al., 2002, 2007; Coufal et al., 2011 ). We reasoned that if A3A specifically inhibits L1 EN activity, ENi L1 retrotransposition events should escape A3A inhibition

., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007 ). To test whether UNG contributed to the inhibition of L1 retrotransposition downstream of A3A activity, we conducted L1 retrotransposition assays in the presence of codon optimized bacteriophage-derived uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor ( UGI ) that selectively inhibits UNG activity ( Kaiser and Emerman, 2006; Figure 3A )

., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b ). Moreover, A3A inhibited L1. 3 retrotransposition when it was expressed from its native 5′UTR on a non-episomal vector ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D: pKS101/L1. 3/sv+ ). Together, these experiments show that A3A inhibits retrotransposition of diverse LINE elements in cultured cells

. Thus, coupled with identification of a deamination-induced mutation in genomic DNA flanking a newly retrotransposed L1 ( Figure 3D ), these data suggest that the detected A3A-mediated deamination events occur on single-strand DNA during TPRT rather than on L1 mRNA or single-strand episomal plasmid DNA prior to L1 retrotransposition.

. ( C ) Deamination of the 3′ flanking bottom-strand genomic DNA: in the presence of UGI, deamination of transiently exposed single-strand 3′ flanking genomic DNA during TPRT, in principle, is predicted to result in a G-to-A change in the 3′ TSD relative to the 5′ TSD. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02008. 016 The over-expression of A3A does not abolish L1 retrotransposition completely, but reduces it to ∼30% of control levels

. However, in the presence of ectopically expressed UGI, A3A-mediated deamination events become unveiled in the retrotransposed L1s ( Figure 3D, F, 4A ). We further propose that A3A can act on transiently exposed single-strand genomic DNA flanking L1 integration sites ( Figure 4B, C ). The deamination of 5′-flanking top-strand genomic DNA could account for generation of inexact target-site duplications ( Figure 3D )

. The milder inhibition of A3A on L1SM retrotransposition may be due to the GC-rich nature of the L1SM transcript, the elevated steady state levels of L1 cDNA in cells, or the presence of other cellular factors that counteract A3 deaminase activity.

    Title: Rem2 stabilizes intrinsic excitability and spontaneous firing in visual circuits
    Abstract: Sensory experience plays an important role in shaping neural circuitry by affecting the synaptic connectivity and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. Identifying the molecular players responsible for converting external stimuli into altered neuronal output remains a crucial step in understanding experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function. Here, we investigate the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity. We demonstrate that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, our data establish a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. Consistent with these findings, both in vitro and in vivo recordings reveal increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.

   ., 2016; Mardinly et al., 2016 ). Our data indicate that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity in order to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. In the future, defining these Rem2-dependent signaling mechanisms will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuitry.

. These results raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. In order to gain more insight into the circuit mechanisms that might underlie the observed OD plasticity deficits of Rem2-/- mice, we went on to examine adult OD plasticity

. Hence, our findings that Rem2 functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at the morphological, cellular and circuit levels provide an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function

. Given that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience ( Figure 1B ), we sought to determine if Rem2 plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation by investigating ocular dominance ( OD ) plasticity

. The activity-regulated Ras-like GTPase Rem2 is an excellent candidate to link the activity of a neural circuit with functional plasticity. Rem2 is a member of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir ( RGK ) protein family, a Ras-related subfamily of small GTPases ( Finlin et al., 2000 ), whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels ( Ghiretti et al., 2014 )

. Thus, it is possible that the decrease in intrinsic excitability observed in the Rem2-/- mouse following 2d MD ( Figure 7A, B ) implicates additional roles for Rem2. For example, Rem2 may play a role in regulating presynaptic neurotransmitter release, which in turn influences how individual neurons response to circuit-level changes in activity. Given our findings ex vivo, we hypothesized that spontaneous activity could be perturbed in the intact visual cortex of Rem2-/- mice

. Because Rem2 expression and signaling is sensitive to neuronal activity levels ( Ghiretti et al., 2013; Ghiretti et al., 2014 ), and Rem2 signaling regulates changes in gene expression ( Kenny et al., 2017 ), we hypothesized that Rem2 could be a key regulator of cortical plasticity mechanisms in the intact nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we generated Rem2 knockout mice to directly assess how Rem2 influences cortical plasticity in the mammalian visual system

., 2017; van Welie et al., 2011 ). Thus, Rem2 signaling may regulate neuronal intrinsic excitability by controlling the composition or function of ion channels at the cell membrane. Our previous findings revealed that Rem2 is also an important regulator of synapse formation and dendritic morphology in cultured neurons and Xenopus optic tectum ( Ghiretti et al., 2013; Ghiretti et al., 2014; Ghiretti and Paradis, 2011; Moore et al., 2013 )

. Thus far, our data implicate Rem2 in regulating synaptic strengthening in the context of monocular deprivation ( Figures 5C and 6d MD ), mediating excitatory synapse function ( Figure 5D, Figure 8E ), and cell-autonomously regulating intrinsic excitability independent of synaptic modification ( Figure 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ). Given these data, we hypothesized that Rem2 could also regulate spontaneous firing rates in a cell autonomous manner

., 2008a; Rutherford et al., 1998 ), Homer1a ( Hu et al., 2010; Nedivi, 1999 ), MHCI ( Goddard et al., 2007; Syken et al., 2006 ), and NARP ( Chang et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2013 ), a comparable understanding of the regulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability is lacking. Rem2 is a noncanonical Ras-like GTPase, expressed throughout the cell ( Ghiretti and Paradis, 2011 ) and is unlikely to be regulated by its nucleotide binding state ( Correll et al

Our findings demonstrate that Rem2 functions in excitatory cortical neurons to mediate OD plasticity in response to long-term monocular deprivation during the critical period ( Figures 3 and 4 ) in part through regulating intrinsic excitability and synaptic function

. Thus, while it remains to be determined exactly how these two processes function synergistically to maintain proper circuit function, our discovery of the role of Rem2 in this process provides novel insight into the importance of neuronal regulation of intrinsic excitability to sculpting network output. While a number of molecules have been implicated in regulation of synaptic scaling ( Arc ( Gao et al., 2010; Shepherd et al., 2006 ), BDNF ( Kaneko et al., 2008a; Rutherford et al

. We found that Rem2-/- mice exhibit a deficit in late-phase OD plasticity during the critical period, whereas early-phase OD plasticity and adult OD plasticity are normal. These functional deficits depend specifically on deletion of Rem2 from excitatory neurons in the cortex. At the cellular level, we found that Rem2-/- neurons exhibit altered regulation of synaptic function and increased intrinsic excitability

. p. i. ). These results indicate that a primary function of Rem2 is to regulate intrinsic excitability in a cell-autonomous manner. However, this experiment does not resolve the relationship between altered intrinsic excitability and synapse function observed in the Rem2-/- mice

., 2016 ). Thus, while baseline Rem2 protein levels may decline with age, Rem2 mRNA expression continues to be regulated by neuronal activity in discrete cell types into adulthood. These activity-dependent changes in Rem2 expression suggest that Rem2 function may be relevant throughout the life of the animal. To determine if Rem2 functions to regulate visual system plasticity in vivo, we generated a Rem2 knockout mouse

., 2014 ). Further, gene knockdown approaches in cultured cortical neurons and Xenopus laevis optic tectum established that Rem2 is a positive regulator of synapse formation and a negative regulator of dendritic complexity ( Ghiretti et al., 2013; Ghiretti et al., 2014; Ghiretti and Paradis, 2011; Moore et al., 2013 ), suggesting Rem2 may regulate structural plasticity in an activity-dependent manner

. p. i., Figure 8A left ) or 10–12 d. p. i. ( Figure 8A right ), and f-I curves constructed from GFP+, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to determine if Rem2 regulates neuronal intrinsic excitability in a cell-autonomous manner. Surprisingly, we found that acute, sparse deletion of Rem2 from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons 4 d. p. i. led to a significant increase in intrinsic excitability in response to current injection ( Figure 8B, Rem2flx/flx + AAV GFP-Cre 4 d. p. i

. These data ( Figures 7 and 9 and Figure 10 ) also provide a parsimonious explanation for the intrinsic signal imaging results observed in Rem2-/- animals ( Figure 3C ), and support the conclusion that Rem2 regulates the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation through regulation of intrinsic excitability.

. Therefore, we conclude that Rem2 functions in a cell-autonomous manner to regulate intrinsic excitability irrespective of changes in excitatory synaptic density. Taken together, these data suggest that the dramatic decrease in mEPSC frequency observed in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in Rem2-/- mice ( Figure 5D, right ) most likely reflects a combination of both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of Rem2 deletion

. In contrast, Rem2-/- mice display both impaired synaptic scaling up ( Figure 5 ) and altered intrinsic excitability ( Figure 7 ), as well as a generalized increase of individual eye responses with 6d MD ( Figure 3C ). These latter results are consistent with the hypothesis that Rem2 regulates responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation through regulation of intrinsic excitability and synaptic function

Our results demonstrate that Rem2 is a key regulator of intrinsic excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience, and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuit.

    Title: Physical limits to magnetogenetics
    Abstract: This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells. It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in biological systems. The first claims to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals ( Qin et al., 2016 ). Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016 ). Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

    Supporting Text:
   . The forces or torques or temperatures they produce are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels. If the phenomena occurred as described, they must rely on some entirely different mechanism. Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success

. ( 2016 ) reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane. Their single-component protein consists of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel ( TRPV4 ) fused on the intracellular face to two subunits of ferritin. The hope was that “the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to depolarize cells”

. Indeed, the report includes experimental results from several preparations suggesting that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields ( There is a similar claim in Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) ; but the evidence is scant and hard to interpret: only 18 of ~2000 cells'responded' ( their Supplementary Figure 10 ) ). What could be the underlying biophysical mechanism? Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter

There has been renewed interest recently in the effects of magnetic fields on biological cells. On the one hand we have the old puzzle of magnetosensation: How do organisms sense the Earth’s magnetic field for the purpose of navigation? The biophysical basis for this ability is for the most part unresolved. On the other hand lies the promise of'magnetogenetics': the dream of making neurons and other cells responsive to magnetic fields for the purpose of controlling their activity with ease

. It has been suggested that magnetosensation in animals similarly relies on a magnetite mechanism, for example by coupling the movement of a small magnetic crystal to a membrane channel ( Kirschvink et al., 2001 ). A competing proposal for magnetosensation suggests that the magnetic field acts on single molecules in certain biochemical reactions ( Ritz et al., 2010 )

. In the third, the magnetic field exerts a torque assuming that the ferritin core is anisotropic, with a preferred axis of magnetization. Finally, the collective pull of many ferritins on the cell membrane may induce a stress that opens stretch-activated channels. For a different mode of activating membrane channels, Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) combined the expression of ferritin protein with that of the temperature-sensitive membrane channel TRPV1

. A 100-fold larger field could produce torque comparable with the thermal energy, which when applied to thousands of channels might have a noticeable effect on membrane currents. To enhance the shape anisotropy of the magnetic particles, perhaps one could engineer the ferritin shell into an elongated shape. More fundamentally, it is clear that the weak effects computed here are a consequence of ferritin’s paramagnetism

. ( 2016 ) introduces a new proposal. As for magnetotactic bacteria, the principle is that of a compass needle that aligns with the magnetic field, but here the needle consists of a single macromolecule. This putative magnetic receptor protein was isolated from the fruit fly and forms a rod-shaped multimeric complex that includes 40 iron atoms. The authors imaged individual complexes by electron microscopy on a sample grid

. The two are closely linked, because uncovering Nature’s method for magnetosensation can point the way to effectively engineering magnetogenetics. The physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter are taught to science students in college ( Feynman et al., 1963 ). Obviously those principles impose some constraints on what biological mechanisms are plausible candidates, for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics

. ( 2015 )? Given the long-standing interest in ferritin for medical engineering ( Babincova et al., 2000 ), the extensive research on its magnetic properties ( Papaefthymiou, 2010 ), and the ease with which magnetic heating can be measured, it is surprisingly difficult to find any published evidence for magnetic heating in ferritin

The calculations presented here evaluate the mechanisms that might underlie recent observations on a molecular compass ( Qin et al., 2016 ) and neural activation with static magnetic fields ( Wheeler et al., 2016 ) or high-frequency magnetic fields ( Stanley et al., 2015 ). These calculations show that none of the biophysical schemes proposed in these articles is even remotely plausible, and a few additional proposals were eliminated along the way

. It is in fact possible to pull on cells that express lots of ferritin, and this has been exploited for magnetic separation ( Owen and Lindsay, 1983 ). It requires very high magnetic fields, and separation columns with a meshwork of fine steel fibers that produce strong gradients on a microscopic scale. Inserting such a wire mesh into the brain would of course negate the goal of non-invasive control

Generally speaking, magnetic fields interact only weakly with biological matter. The reason magnetic fields are used for whole-body medical imaging, and why they have such appeal for magnetogenetics, is that they penetrate through tissues essentially undisturbed. The other side of this coin is that evolution had to develop rather special mechanisms to sense a magnetic field at all, especially one as weak as the Earth’s field

. Wheeler et al. ( 2016 ) suppose optimistically that the two subunits of ferritin attached to the channel protein are able to nucleate an entire 24-subunit ferritin complex. The hollow core of this particle can be filled with iron in the form of a ferric hydroxide ( Arosio et al., 2009 ). At room temperature ferritin has no permanent magnetization: it is strictly paramagnetic or superparamagnetic ( Papaefthymiou, 2010 )

. Two other hypothetical mechanisms for the ferritin effects require a strong field but no gradient. This would be of great experimental value, because a homogeneous magnetic field could then deliver the same control signal throughout an extended volume, like the brain of a mouse. Among these, the dipole interaction between ferritins ( Figure 1b, Equation 14 ) offers little hope. Even with a 100-fold larger field ( 5 T ), these forces are still 4 log units too small to open a channel

. A particle with a permanent magnetic moment, such as the magnetosomes made by bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel, 2004 ), could exert much larger forces, torques, and temperatures ( Hergt et al., 2006 ), and may offer a physically realistic route to magnetogenetics. With an eye towards such future developments, it is unfortunate that these three questionable claims were published, especially in high-profile journals, because that discourages further innovation

. Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) compared three different options for interaction between the ion channels in the plasma membrane and the ferritin protein: In one case the ferritin was expressed in the cytoplasm, in another it was targeted to the membrane by a myristoyl tail, and in the third it was tethered directly to the channel protein by a camelid antibody linkage

. For that purpose, the bacterium synthesizes ferrimagnetic crystals of magnetite and arranges them in a chain within the cell. This gives the bacterium a permanent magnetic moment, and allows it to act like a small compass needle. The cell’s long axis aligns with the magnetic field and flagella in the back of the cell propel it along the field lines

Central to the arguments about magnetogenetics is the proportionality factor ξ between the magnetic moment m of a single ferritin molecule and the magnetic field B, ( 26 ) m= ξB. Experimental measurements are usually performed on bulk samples of ferritin and report the magnetic susceptibility χ, defined by ( 27 ) M= χH=χB/μ0, where M is the magnetization of the material, namely the magnetic moment per unit volume, and ( 28 ) μ0=4π×10−7NA2 is the vacuum permeability

. The hope was that a high-frequency magnetic field could be used to heat the iron core of ferritin, leading to a local temperature increase sufficient to open the TRPV1 channels, allowing cations to flow into the cell. Stanley et al

The article discusses the limitations of magnetogenetics, a field that aims to make cells responsive to magnetic fields for controlling their activity. Recent studies suggest magnetosensation, the ability of organisms to sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation, relies on a magnetite mechanism or biochemical reactions. However, these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, producing forces or temperatures that are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels. The paramagnetic nature of ferritin limits its utility for magnetically sensitive cells.

Ferritin is a protein with 24 subunits forming a spherical shell, 12 nm in diameter, and has no permanent magnetization, being strictly paramagnetic or superparamagnetic. Proposed mechanisms for ferr effects rely on strong fields or gradients, which are difficult to achieve in biological systems. The dipole interaction between ferrins offers little hope, with forces 4 units too small to open channels. A particle with a permanent moment, such as magnetosomes, could exert larger forces and torques, offering a realistic route to magnetogen.

Studies on magnetosensation and magnetetics have been published in high-profile journals, discouraging further innovation. Ferritin has been used for medical engineering, with extensive research on its magnetic properties, but no evidence of magnetic heating has been found. Calculations show none of proposed biophysical schemes are plausible, eliminating additional proposals along the way. It is possible to pull cells with ferritin, but requires high fields and a mesh of steel fibers, negating the goal of non-invasive control.

Magnetic fields interact weakly with biological matter, used for whole-body imaging and appealing for magnetogen, but penetrate undisturbed. Evolution developed special mechanisms to sense magnetic fields, especially the Earth's. Proposed mechanisms for ferr effects require strong fields or gradients, which are difficult to achieve. A homogeneous field could deliver control throughout a volume, like a brain, but dipole interaction ferrins offer little hope.

    Title: Transient nuclear Prospero induces neural progenitor quiescence
    Abstract: Stem cells can self-renew, differentiate, or enter quiescence. Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics. Drosophila neural progenitors ( neuroblasts ) have been an excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation, but quiescence remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers. The pulse of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors. Furthermore, loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation.

   ., 2010 ). In this study, we show that the Prospero differentiation factor is transiently detected at low levels in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence. We find that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence

. Drosophila neuroblasts have served as a model system for identifying conserved signaling pathways that regulate stem cell proliferation and quiescence ( Ebens et al., 1993; Datta, 1995; Britton and Edgar, 1998; Doe et al., 1998; Egger et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010; Homem and Knoblich, 2012; Weng and Cohen, 2012 )

. We found that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers ( Figure 4E, F; 24 hr timepoint ). In addition, precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ). We conclude that transient, low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03363. 007 Having shown a strong correlation between the timing of nuclear Prospero and neuroblast entry into quiescence, we next asked if Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence and loss of nuclear Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence. In theory, this can be done by quantifying the number of EdU+ neuroblasts in prospero null mutant embryos

., 2008 ). Strikingly, the pulse of nuclear Prospero precisely matched the timing of neuroblast quiescence: it occurred earlier in pdm mutants, and later in cas mutants ( Figure 2E, F ). We conclude that a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry into quiescence, suggesting a functional relationship. 10. 7554/eLife. 03363. 006Figure 2. Transient low level nuclear Prospero is tightly correlated with neuroblast entry into quiescence

. In addition, Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in numb or brat, or the Prospero target gene string, showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence ( data not shown ). 10. 7554/eLife. 03363. 008Figure 3.

Prox1 activates some target genes at high levels but represses some target genes at low levels ( Chen et al., 2008a, 2008b )

Low nuclear Prospero induces neuroblast quiescence, whereas high Prospero induces neuroblast differentiation

. In contrast, high levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress deadpan ( perhaps via low affinity binding sites ) and may even activate neuronal differentiation genes ( Figure 4G ). In embryonic neuroblasts, the temporal transcription factors Pdm and Cas schedule the timing of neuroblast quiescence, but how they regulate Prospero nuclear import is unknown

. The central brain neuroblasts are continuously proliferating during the third larval instar ( Ito and Hotta, 1992 ), and so we used this stage to determine whether transient Prospero expression could induce neuroblast quiescence. We used the TARGET method ( McGuire et al., 2003 ) to transiently induce Prospero expression for 2 hr, and then assayed for neuroblast quiescence 12 hr later ( Figure 4 )

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03363. 011 Our results confirm that high levels of Prospero can trigger differentiation and reveal that low levels of Prospero induce quiescence in the Drosophila neuroblasts. High levels of the vertebrate ortholog Prox1 can also trigger differentiation ( Dyer, 2003; Takahashi et al

. Low levels of nuclear Prospero result in neuroblast quiescence ( Dpn+ Elav− ) ( A ) whereas high levels of nuclear Prospero suppress Deadpan and activate Elav to induce differentiation ( Dpn− Elav+ ) ( B ). Prospero levels were quantified in ( C ). Scale bars: 5 μm. ( C ) Quantification of Prospero levels in quiescent neuroblasts ( Dpn+ Elav− ) or differentiated neuroblasts ( Dpn− Elav+ ).

Third-instar larvae were shifted from 22°C to 30°C to inactivate Gal80, which resulted in nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts

To investigate the transition from a proliferating neuroblast to a quiescent neuroblast, we examined known proliferation/progenitor and differentiation marker expression during this transition. We hypothesized that loss of a progenitor marker or gain of a differentiation marker might induce neuroblast quiescence. As a model system we used the identified neuroblast 3–3 in the thoracic segments ( NB3-3T ) which reliably enters quiescence at embryonic stage 15 ( Tsuji et al., 2008 )

. Drosophila neuroblasts delaminate from neuroectoderm during early embryogenesis, and then they go through multiple rounds of asymmetric cell division before exiting cell cycle at the end of embryogenesis; upon cell cycle exit, neuroblasts can undergo apoptosis ( Karcavitch and Doe, 2005; Maurange and Gould, 2005; Ulvklo et al., 2012 ) or enter quiescence ( Truman and Bate, 1988; Datta, 1995; Tsuji et al., 2008; Chell and Brand, 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011 )

. Interestingly, we did observe transient low level nuclear Prospero in NB3-3T just prior to its entry into quiescence ( see next section ). We conclude that quiescent neuroblasts have a novel transcriptional profile that lacks both progenitor and differentiation markers. Here, we characterize further our observation that NB3-3T showed low level nuclear Prospero at stage 15, concurrent with the entry into quiescence

. To rule out the possibility that these ‘quiescent neuroblasts’ were early in the differentiation pathway, we reasoned that if they were quiescent they could reactivate proliferation in a nourishing environment ( Chell and Brand, 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010 ) whereas if they were early in differentiation they could not. We found that nearly all quies neurobl at 12 hr had reactivated and re-expressed progenitor markers ( Figure 4E, F 24 timepoint ).

    Title: Kinetics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating revealed by single-molecule analysis
    Abstract: Uncoating of the metastable HIV-1 capsid is a tightly regulated disassembly process required for release of the viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. To understand the intrinsic capsid disassembly pathway and how it can be modulated, we have developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to follow the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids in vitro immediately after permeabilizing the viral membrane. Opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, which is followed by rapid, catastrophic collapse. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice strongly delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. Our observations suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently with the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators likely to determine the overall uncoating kinetics.

    Measurement of the single-particle uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids immediately after removing the protective barrier of the viral membrane has allowed us to observe the effects of capsid-binding molecules on discrete steps in the capsid uncoating process. The order of events established with our new assays would have been obscured in ensemble measurements due to dephasing

. ( 3 ) Capsid-binding molecules exhibit differential effects on the steps that control initiation and continuation of uncoating. The structural heterogeneity of the HIV capsid is well described, with the assembly process yielding a variety of conical, tubular and other shapes that often contain structural defects such as gaps in the CA lattice ( Briggs et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2015; Mattei et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2013 )

. Here we describe an in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay that allows us to follow the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment. This type of single-molecule analysis has the advantage that it can resolve intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are otherwise averaged out in traditional ensemble assays. By observing the properties of many individual capsids, it is possible to classify them according to their uncoating behaviors

. We observed the following main characteristics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating and its interactions with capsid-binding molecules: ( 1 ) The integrity and stability of capsids in a population is highly heterogeneous, whereby the majority of capsids contain defects and/or uncoat immediately after removal of the viral membrane. ( 2 ) In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created

. The half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level as shown in Figure 3A. To demonstrate this approach, we added CypA labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 ( AF568 ) at the same time as PFO to the flow channel and followed the fluorescence signals of GFP packaged into the virion and AF568-CypA using dual-color TIRF microscopy

., 2011; Sowd et al., 2016 ). In order to achieve many of these proposed functions, the capsid must interact with host proteins and small metabolites, as well as disassemble to release the viral DNA at the appropriate place and time ( Campbell and Hope, 2015 ). The nature of this ‘uncoating’ process and how it is influenced by host co-factors remains a key unanswered question in HIV biology

Fusion of the viral particle with the plasma membrane marks the point in time when the viral core is first exposed to the cytoplasm, but the effects of cellular proteins and small molecules on the stability of the capsid lattice are largely unknown. Here, we designed a fluorescence imaging assay to pinpoint the time of capsid opening at the single-particle level after exposing capsids to biochemically different environments in vitro

. By utilizing a pore-former to permeabilize the viral membrane in a controlled manner while recording capsid opening traces, we are able to observe early events that occur upon exposure of the capsid to a change in conditions and thus capture unstable assembly states

. We used the capsid opening assay to characterize the intrinsic stability of the HIV capsid in the absence and presence of molecules known to affect the stability of the CA lattice. Figure 2A shows the fraction of capsids that are leaky, undergo opening or remain closed within 30 min of adding PFO to the immobilized particles. Leaky capsids constituted the largest fraction of particles ( 60–80% ), irrespective of which type of capsid-binding molecules were present in the solution

. Current biochemical methods used to study HIV capsid stability include an in vitro uncoating assay for the release of CA from isolated capsids ( Ambrose and Aiken, 2014; Shah and Aiken, 2011 ), the fate of capsid assay ( Stremlau et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2014 ) and the cyclosporin A washout assay ( Hulme et al., 2011 ). These assays measure uncoating in bulk, that is rely on observing the average behavior of large numbers of viral cores

., 2010 ). At high concentration ( ≥10 µM ), it blocks HIV infection at a stage before reverse transcription ( Price et al., 2014 ). It has been described as stabilizing self-assembled hexameric CA or CA-NC tubes but destabilizing HIV cores ( Bhattacharya et al., 2014; Da Silva Santos et al., 2016; Fricke et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2011 ). In our assay, PF74 uncoupled the step of capsid opening from lattice disassembly

. Taken together, our observations show that measuring GFP release from authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level is suitable to reveal the heterogeneity of capsid assembly states and quantify the effect of capsid binders on the opening kinetics of intact capsids

., 2016 ). As observed for leaky capsids, we detected residual CypA intensity at the end of the disassembly phase, possibly due to the presence of some CA molecules remaining associated with the viral RNA inside the permeabilized viral particle. Overall, the disassembly process after capsid opening followed a similar process as observed for leaky capsids, but with slower kinetics

. Fluorescence microscopy methods that track the uncoating process in fixed or live cells ( Francis et al., 2016; Mamede et al., 2017 ) can resolve steps in the uncoating process of individual capsids in the cytoplasm but complementary in vitro methods that allow high throughput measurements and detailed kinetic studies under defined conditions are still missing

., 1997] ) and CA hexamer ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ), respectively, while the off-rates determined after removal of CypA from solution were 4 ± 0. 3 s−1 and 3. 5 ± 0. 4 s−1, respectively. We conclude that CypA binds with low affinity to the authentic viral capsid lattice shortly after membrane permeabilization in an interaction that is governed by rapid kinetics and not fundamentally different from its interaction with CA that is not part of a lattice

., 2013 ). The abundance of these types of particles obtained here using a viral preparation protocol that avoids harsh treatments ( such as centrifugation ) suggests that capsid assembly frequently becomes trapped at this stage, whereby remodeling of the lattice to allow it to close might be a slow process. Host cell proteins that interact with the viral capsid after cell entry often recognize assembled CA rather than CA monomers ( Yamashita and Engelman, 2017 )

. This approach circumvents the need for isolating viral cores, a process which exposes cores to experimental buffer conditions for extended periods of time ( Shah and Aiken, 2011 ) and would result in a loss of this information. Our results show that the assembly states range from incomplete or imperfect ( leaky ) lattices to fully assembled ( closed ) capsids that nevertheless exhibit pronounced differences in uncoating kinetics

. In our assay, we detected viral membrane permeabilization and capsid opening using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to monitor the release of GFP molecules trapped in these compartments

. Similarly, we found that lattice disassembly of an initially intact capsid is a rapid process that ensues as soon as the first gap in the lattice has appeared, that is uncoating is primarily controlled by the slow rate of removing the first ( few ) CA subunits

. We interpret the second phase as the disassembly of most of the CA lattice. The median disassembly kinetics after capsid opening ( Figure 4E, right heatmap ) were governed by a half-life of approximately 70–100 s. The rapid decay of the lattice after initiation of uncoating observed here with labeled monomeric CypA is consistent with previous measurements in vitro and in cells using a tetrameric probe, CypA-dsRed, that binds irreversibly to the capsid ( Francis et al,2016; Mamed et al,2017 )

    Title: The cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway promotes genome stability and prevents tumor initiation
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Analysis of breast cancer genomic DNA indicates frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling pathway. Since JNK signaling can promote cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor, this apparent association of reduced JNK signaling with tumor development was unexpected. We examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium. Loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency caused widespread early neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. This tumor suppressive function was not mediated by a role of JNK in the growth of established tumors, but by a requirement of JNK to prevent tumor initiation. Together, these data identify JNK pathway defects as ‘driver’ mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation.

   . In contrast, we found that loss of JNK signaling in mammary epithelial cells caused breast cancer. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. These effects of JNK deficiency to promote tumor development were associated with widespread presence of early neoplasia and genomic instability. We show that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development

. Nevertheless, the significance of JNK pathway inactivation in breast cancer is unclear ( Cellurale et al., 2012; Cellurale et al., 2010 ). Here, we demonstrate that loss of JNK signaling promotes murine breast cancer development ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerated tumor development in a murine model of breast cancer ( Figure 3 )

. The frequent JNK pathway loss-of-function mutations in human breast cancer may therefore represent ‘driver’ mutations that promote tumor development. We find that JNK loss plays a key role at the early stages of breast cancer development by promoting mammary gland neoplasia ( Figure 7 ). This observation likely accounts for the effect of mutational inactivation of JNK signaling to promote tumor development ( Figure 1 and 3 )

. The JNK signaling pathway may therefore be suppressed in many breast cancers. The association of breast cancer with reduced JNK signaling represents a correlation. What is the significance of loss-of-function JNK pathway mutations? Are these ‘driver’ or ‘passenger’ mutations? The purpose of this study was to test the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development. Since JNK signaling causes AP1 transcription factor activation, we anticipated that JNK may act to promote tumor growth

., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 ). The major conclusions of this study are that: ( 1 ) JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer; and ( 2 ) JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer

. Thus, the frequent loss-of-function JNK pathway mutations in breast tumors represent ‘driver’ mutations that promote breast cancer development.

The frequent mutation of the JNK pathway in human breast cancer ( including the genes MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and MAP2K7 ) implicates reduced JNK signaling in the etiology of mammary carcinoma ( Banerji et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 )

. These well-established ‘driver’ mutations contribute to the etiology of breast cancer. In contrast, the role of some other highly mutated genes in breast cancer is unclear. One frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer is the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 )

. To test whether JNK pathway disruption influences breast cancer development, we examined the effect of JNK-deficiency in the mammary epithelium. The JNK1 ( encoded by Mapk8 ) and JNK2 ( encoded by Mapk9 ) isoforms exhibit partially redundant functions ( Davis, 2000 )

. JNK therefore plays a major role in early tumor development, but only a minor role in established tumors. An important question relates to the mechanism of breast tumor suppression by the JNK signaling pathway. Part of the mechanism may reflect the pro-apoptotic role of JNK ( Tournier et al., 2000 ). Mutations in key genes can enable epithelial cell survival in the luminal space, resulting in ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) and cancer ( Halaoui et al

., 2006; Xie et al., 2017 ). It is therefore possible that JNK signaling may have pro-oncogenic functions in certain tumor types or under specific conditions ( Whitmarsh and Davis, 2007 ). Nevertheless, our analysis establishes that a major role of JNK signaling in the breast epithelium is tumor suppression ( Figure 1 and 3 ). This role of JNK signaling is consistent with the discovery of frequent JNK pathway gene ablation and mutation in human breast cancer ( Banerji et al

. These observations indicate that JNK can act as a breast cancer tumor suppressor. This is a significant finding because frequent mutational inactivation of genes that encode JNK pathway components ( e. g. MAP2K4 and MAP3K1 ) are detected in human breast cancer ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 ). However, it should be noted that the compound disruption of JNK expression that we have studied most likely differs from the loss of individual JNK pathway components ( e. g

. These data indicate that JNK deficiency promotes breast tumor development. Microscopic analysis of tumor sections demonstrated the presence of adenosquamous carcinoma in MEWT mice, but both adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma were detected in MEKO mice ( Figure 1C, E, F )

Loss-of-function mutations in the JNK signaling pathway ( e. g. MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and MAP2K7 ) are implicated in the etiology of breast cancer ( Banerji et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 ). These potential ‘driver’ mutations in breast cancer cause disruption of JNK signaling

., 2000 ). Tumor-associated ablation or mutation of these genes therefore causes JNK inhibition. Moreover, JNK signaling is also inhibited by phosphorylation of MAP2K4 by AKT ( Park et al., 2002 ) in breast tumors with AKT activation caused by ‘driver’ mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 ). Suppression of JNK signaling is therefore a characteristic of many breast cancers

. These data suggest that MEKO tumors may exploit the WNT pathway during tumor development. The observation that JNK deficiency promotes breast tumorigenesis ( Figure 1 ) suggests that defects in JNK signaling may accelerate tumor development in a sensitized genetic background. To test this hypothesis, we examined the genetic interaction between JNK inactivation and loss of TRP53

., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 ). The genetic changes include frequent deletion of the gene locus and mutations that cause protein truncation and loss of protein kinase activity. This analysis suggests that breast cancer is associated with loss of JNK signaling. Indeed, since AKT phosphorylates and inactivates MAP2K4 ( Park et al., 2002 ), breast cancer ‘driver’ mutations that activate AKT ( e. g. PTEN and PI3K ) also cause loss of JNK signaling

., 2018 ) in vivo. It is therefore possible that these types of cell survival responses in the mammary epithelium may contribute to tumor development. However, this mechanism may not be sufficient to account for the tumor formation caused by JNK deficiency ( Figure 1 ) or the observed acceleration of tumor formation caused by JNK deficiency in a mouse model of breast cancer ( Figure 3 )

. For example, the JNK pathway can promote cell proliferation and survival through regulation of AP1 transcription factors ( Das et al., 2007; Lamb et al., 2003; Ventura et al., 2003 ). Indeed, the JNK/JUN signaling pathway may promote the proliferation of some breast tumor cells in vitro ( Guo et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2017 )

., 2018; Gawrzyn et al. 2018; et al. 2018; et al 2018; et al 2018; et al 2018; et al 201; et 2018; et 201; et 201; et 201; et 201; et 201; et 201; et 201; 201; et 201;201; et 201;201; et201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201

    Title: A bioactive peptide amidating enzyme is required for ciliogenesis
    Abstract: The pathways controlling cilium biogenesis in different cell types have not been fully elucidated. We recently identified peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase ( PAM ), an enzyme required for generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, in Chlamydomonas and mammalian cilia. Here, we show that PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, planaria and mice. Chlamydomonas PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. The architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in Pam-/- mouse embryos was also aberrant. Our data suggest that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects and provide an unanticipated, highly conserved link between PAM, amidation and ciliary assembly.

    Supporting Text:
    Our work has identified PAM as a crucial, evolutionarily conserved factor that is required for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. PAM is important for the biogenesis of the motile cilia present in C. reinhardtii and on the ventral epithelium of planaria, as well as the normal assembly of the primary cilia of neuroepithelial cells in mammals. In C

., 2016b ). Together, these observations in multiple cell types suggested that PAM has a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia. Here we demonstrate that PAM plays a key conserved role during the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types.

., 2011; Jekley Jékely and Arendt, 2006 ). It is possible that PAM was included in the set of signaling proteins trafficked to the ciliary compartment from the Golgi in the ancestral eukaryote. In conclusion, our results suggest that both the amidation and membrane trafficking roles of PAM contribute to ciliogenesis.

., 2010 ), where growth of the axoneme is initiated inside a ciliary vesicle in the cytoplasm. Docking of the ciliary vesicle subsequently leads to emergence of the cilium outward from the cell surface. Key steps in these ciliogenic pathways may exhibit differential sensitivity to the lack of PAM in distinct organisms and tissues

. While reduction of PAM in C. reinhardtii and planaria resulted in a dramatic defect in ciliary assembly, complete loss of PAM in mice did not abolish primary cilia formation in neuroepithelial cells, although they were significantly shorter than cilia in wild type animals and in many cases only ciliary stubs were evident ( Figure 6 ). It is unknown if these short cilia are functional

. However, as Chlamydomonas stockpiles sufficient components to regenerate two approximately half-length cilia in the absence of additional protein synthesis ( Rosenbaum et al., 1969 ), it is also possible that these cells, which initially contain wild type levels of enzymatically active PAM, already have enough amidated products available to allow ciliogenesis to occur, albeit in a delayed manner

. reinhardtii. Using an antibody recognizing the cytosolic domain of CrPAM, we found that this enzyme is present in the Golgi and cilia ( aka flagella ). PAM was also observed in motile and primary cilia of mammalian cells ( tracheal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, spermatozoa ) ( Kumar et al., 2016b ). Furthermore, in C. reinhardtii cilia, PAM activity displayed an unexpected, strong biochemical association with the axonemal superstructure ( Kumar et al., 2016b )

The cytosolic domain of mammalian PAM is not required for enzyme activity, but controls its endocytic trafficking, and acts as a hub for various cytosolic protein interactions ( Milgram et al., 1993; Prigge et al., 1997 )

. Diagram illustrating the location and trafficking of key ciliogenesis factors in the presence of PAM ( left ) and the consequences of PAM loss ( right ). The PAM catalytic domains are in the lumen of the secretory pathway, where they act on glycine-extended peptides and lipids to yield amidated products. In the cilium, these PAM domains are exposed to the extracellular environment

. The evolutionarily widespread occurrence of the PAM gene and the results presented here suggest that at least one of the ancestral and conserved roles of PAM is in ciliary assembly. The prevailing theory of ciliary evolution is that polarized trafficking of signaling proteins and receptors from the Golgi complex using coat proteins, such as IFT and COP proteins, gave rise to a plasma membrane sensory patch that ultimately gained a microtubule backbone ( Carvalho-Santos et al

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 25728. 011 To test whether this unexpected role for PAM in ciliogenesis was conserved in metazoans, we utilized RNAi-mediated gene knockdown in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which has a ciliated ventral epithelium used for gliding locomotion. The S. mediterranea genome encodes a bifunctional PAM protein with a transmembrane domain and cytosolic domain, a soluble PHM protein and a soluble PAL protein ( Figure 4A )

. Although basal body docking and cell division were comparable to control cells, extension of the microtubules from the basal body was disrupted in PAM amiRNA cells, similar to the phenotype of mutants defective for IFT88 and IFT46 ( Hou et al., 2007; Pazour et al., 2000 ). Analyzing the roles of monofunctional PHM and bifunctional membrane PAM in planaria revealed additional complexities in the regulation of ciliogenesis ( Figure 4 )

. Identifying the domains/regions of PAM necessary for its localization to the cilium will be important to address this issue. Our PBA and neocuproine studies indicate that wildtype cells can regrow cilia even when PHM activity has been inhibited. Thus, it is possible that cilia can regrow in the absence of enzymatically active PAM provided that all the necessary structures ( such as attached basal bodies, functional IFT machinery etc ) are already available

. Ciliary length was very heterogeneous in the RNAi-fed animals - short cilia were interspersed with cilia of normal length, presumably due to variations in the ciliary remodeling process ( Figure 5A ). As loss of PHM activity alone resulted in a ciliogenesis defect in planaria, these results further support a role for amidating activity in this process. 10. 7554/eLife. 25728. 016Figure 5. Ciliary morphology is affected in Smed-phm ( RNAi ) and Smed-phm+pam ( RNAi ) planaria

. Why does loss of PAM lead to closely related, yet pleomorphic defects in ciliogenesis in different organisms? The answer is unclear, but differences in the pathways utilized for assembling cilia in various cell types may contribute to the different phenotypes observed. Indeed, distinct cell- and organism-specific phenotypes have been observed when ciliary genes are mutated ( Chaya et al., 2014; Lechtreck et al., 2008; Lechtreck and Witman, 2007 )

. Neocuproine treatment delayed reformation of ~9. 5 μm cilia by 20–30 mins ( Figure 2J ). Together, analysis of the PAM-ΔCD strain and the enzyme inhibitor studies support a role for PAM activity in ciliogenesis. We next assessed the ultrastructural defects resulting from PAM deficiency in C. reinhardtii cells. Compared to the normal ciliary morphology observed in longitudinal sections of control cells ( Figure 3A ), we observed only short ciliary stubs in PAM knockdown cells

Our RNAi analysis revealed a predominant role for PHM in gliding velocity; simultaneous knockdown of soluble PHM and membrane PAM resulted in a more robust defect in ciliogenesis than knockdown of either single gene ( Figure 5A ). In the double knockdown animals, we observed a striking loss of motile cilia and the ectopic localization of fully assembled axonemes in the cytoplasm of cells in the ventral epithelium ( Figure 5H–K )

Cilia are ancient microtubule-based organelles derived from the basal body, and were present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and metazoan. Cilia are involved in sensing and transducing signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm of the cell. The cilium is composed of a microtub core surrounded by a ciliary membrane, the axoneme and basal body. The axeme is the site of microt nucleation and the basal body is the site of ciliogenesis. The cilium can be motile or immotile. Motile cilia are involved in sensing and transdu signals from the extracellular to the cytoplasm of the cell, while immot cilia are involved in sensing and transdu signals from the cytoplasm to the extracellular. The cilium is composed of a microt core surrounded by a ciliary membrane, the axeme and basal body. The axeme is the site of microtation and the basal is the site cogenesis.

    Title: Myosin III-mediated cross-linking and stimulation of actin bundling activity of Espin
    Abstract: Class III myosins ( Myo3 ) and actin-bundling protein Espin play critical roles in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and their defects cause hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif ( THDI ), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1.

    Supporting Text:
   . The authors also proposed that Myo3 binding can release the auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles ( Zheng et al., 2014 ). Myo3a/Myo3b are known to co-localize with Espin1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells ( Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2006 ). Importantly, co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 can further stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells ( Salles et al., 2009 )

. Therefore, one can envision that a key function of the Myo3/Espin1 interaction is to promote formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. 10. 7554/eLife. 12856. 017Figure 6. Myo3 binding promotes Espin1’s higher order actin bundling activity

., 2003 ). The THDI mediates binding of Myo3 to its cargo protein Espin1 ( Ectoplasmic specialization protein 1 ) and allows Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. Once tip localized, Espin1 WH2 domain promotes the elongation of actin protrusions ( Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009 ). However, the detailed molecular basis governing the Myo3 and Espin1 interaction is not clear. 10. 7554/eLife. 12856

. With the help of the motor domain-mediated high affinity binding of Myo3 to actin filaments ( Dose et al., 2007; Kambara et al., 2006 ), the full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. As such, our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein

., 2011; Zheng et al., 2000 ). These genetic findings convincingly point to critical roles of espin in stereocilia development and maintenance, likely by promoting the assembly and stabilization of parallel actin filament bundles in stereocilia ( Bartles, 2000; Sekerkova et al., 2006 ). Here, we discover that both Myo3a and Myo3b contain two highly similar repeat sequences in their THDI region, each capable of independently binding to Espin1-AR with high affinity

. These discoveries, together with our cell-based filopodia formation and localization assay and microscopic-based actin bundling assay, provide compelling evidences showing that Myo3 and Espin1 work together to assemble and promote higher order parallel actin bundle formation in cellular processes such as stereocilia

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12856. 016 Our above structural and biochemical characterizations of the Myo3 and Espin1 interactions point to a likely regulatory role of Myo3 on Espin1’s actin binding and bundling activity. It can be deduced that binding of Myo3-ARBs can first release the auto-inhibited conformation of Espin1. Perhaps more importantly, formation of Myo3/Espin1 complex leads to two Espin1 molcules to be juxtaposed to each other, forming a Myo3 cross-linked Espin1 dimer

. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the partially redundant functions of Myo3a and Myo3b in hair cells. This analysis also predicts that Espin-like proteins can also bind to Myo3 as Espin1 does, suggesting that the functions of Espin1 and Espin-like protein may also be partially redundant in tissues like stereocilia ( Shin et al., 2013 )

. Both Myo3 and Espin1 are known to concentrate at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells and at the tips of filopodia when expressed in heterologous cells ( Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2006 ). It is possible that stabilization of the growing end of the actin filaments at the plus ends by both Myo3 and Espin1 is a critical driving force for actin filament elongations ( Avenarius et al., 2014; Loomis et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2013 )

. Due to the large space between the N-terminal AR and C-terminal ABD in Espin1 ( Figure 1A ), this Myo3-mediated cross-linking positions the two copies of Espin1 ABD at a distance considerably larger than those allowed by other known actin cross-linking proteins. Therefore, we predicted that binding of Myo3 may stimulate higher order actin bundling activity of Espin1

. As a high duty ratio motor, processive and rapid movement along the actin filaments is not likely to be the main function of Myo3, although the motor can still move towards the plus end of actin filaments ( Les Erickson et al., 2003; Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2006 ). Instead, one of Myo3’s key functions appears to coordinate with its cargo protein Espin1 to regulate Espin1-mediated actin filaments assembly and stability

. It also demonstrates an intimate synergistic action mechanism between two classes of actin binding proteins, namely actin filament-based myosin motors and actin filament cross-linking protein, in controlling actin fiber size and stability. It has been reported that another unconventional myosin in stereocilia, Myosin XVa, can form a complex with an actin capping protein Eps8 to regulate stereocilia elongations ( Manor et al

The most important findings of this study are the structure-based discovery of two strong and independent Espin1 binding sites in the tail region of each class III myosins, and Myo3 binding-induced auto-inhibition release of Espin1

. Consistent with this prediction, we demonstrate by electron and fluorescence microscopic studies that binding of Myo3 to Espin1 can further promote formation of Espin1-mediated thicker actin bundles.

. The high resolution crystal structures of each of the two binding sequences from Myo3b in complex with Espin1-AR not only reveal the molecular basis governing the specific interaction between Myo3 and Espin1, but also allow us to discern the Myo3-mediated release of the auto-inhibition mechanism of Espin1. Based on these structural findings, we predict that binding of Myo3 to Espin1 can cluster Espin1 and thus enable Espin1 to further cross-link actin filaments into higher order fibers

., 2003; Shin et al., 2013 ). The Myo3 binding-mediated cross-linking of Espin1 cargo is in sharp contrast to the cargo binding-mediated motor dimerization and processivity induction known in a number of other unconventional myosins ( myosin V, VI and VII ) ( Lu et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2009 ). Such large differences in their cargo bindings probably match with the distinct functional properties of these myosins

Class III myosins ( Myo3 ), together with class IX myosins, are two special groups of the myosin superfamily as these two sub-families of actin motors contain enzymatically active domains and thus are regarded as motorized signaling molecules ( Bähler, 2000 ). The first member of Myo3 was identified in Drosophila photoreceptors and named as NinaC ( neither inactivation nor afterpotential C ) ( Montell and Rubin, 1988 )

., 2014; Loomis et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, the abundance of Myo3 ( My3a and My3b ) in stereocilia is higher than that of Mya and Myb. My3 and Myb are co-localized with Espin at the tips of stereocilia ( Merritt et al,2012; Sal et al. 2009; Schneider et al. 2006 ) and co-expression of My3 and Espin can stimulate elongation of stereilia in cultured of Corti hair cells ( Sal et al 2009 ). My3 and Myb are also co-localized with Espin at the tips of filopodia in heterologous cells ( Merr et al 201; Sal et 2009 Schneider et 2006 )

    Title: Structural determinants of voltage-gating properties in calcium channels
    Abstract: Voltage-gated calcium channels control key functions of excitable cells, like synaptic transmission in neurons and the contraction of heart and skeletal muscles. To accomplish such diverse functions, different calcium channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics. To identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage sensing properties, we combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1. 1. Both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

    Supporting Text:
    Voltage-gated calcium channels ( CaV ) translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx. Thus, they contribute to cellular excitability and they couple electrical activity to fundamental cell functions like contraction of heart and skeletal muscle, secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, and the regulation of gene expression. Together with voltage-gated sodium channels ( NaV ), CaVs form a structurally related ion channel superfamily with a fourfold symmetry ( Figure 1A )

Our advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1. 1 VSDs fill an important gap in the understanding of the voltage sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels

. All tested interaction partners suggested by the model showed the predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis. Conversely, alterations of kinetic properties first recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by our computer model. Overall, the structures of the lowest energy states of CaV1. 1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model ( Catterall et al

Based on the cryo-EM structure of CaV1. 1 ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015 ), we generated a new structural model to study the molecular mechanisms determining the specific gating properties of this voltage-gated calcium channel. To this end, we used the Rosetta computational modeling software ( Bender et al., 2016; Rohl et al., 2004 ) to build a homology model of the human eukaryotic CaV1

., 2021; Wisedchaisri et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019 ). However, up to now the resting states of eukaryotic CaV and NaV channels remained inaccessible to experimental structure determination. Nevertheless, many years of experimental work and structure modeling provide ample support for the sliding helix model of the voltage sensor action ( Catterall et al., 2017; Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 )

. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining how channels using the same general voltage sensing mechanism can produce very distinct gating properties and how in pseudo-tetrameric eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels the distinct VSDs cooperate in establishing the characteristic gating properties.

. Here, we applied molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation and Markov state modeling ( MSM ) combined with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological analyses to identify the molecular mechanism by which individual VSDs determine the characteristic voltage dependence and kinetics of current activation. Our structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1

. The distinct structure of the four VSDs of eukaryotic NaV and CaV suggests that there might be considerable variability between the four VSDs of a channel in the movement of the S4 helices and the molecular interactions of their gating charges. In fact, accumulating evidence indicates functional differences between the VSDs of individual channel isoforms ( Ahern et al., 2016; Pantazis et al., 2014; Tuluc et al., 2016a ). The rabbit skeletal muscle CaV1

., 2016b ). Considering the importance of these ionic interactions in VSD IV for regulating the channel’s voltage dependence, we hypothesized that similarly the specific kinetic properties of CaV1. 1 may be encoded in the structure, ionic interactions, and the molecular kinetics of the state transitions of VSD I

. Finally, the kinetic coordinate system provided by the tICA allows calculation of thermodynamics and kinetics by an MSM ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Using this approach, we modeled the resting state structures of CaV1. 1 VSDs I and IV, because they represent the two structurally distinguishable classes of VSDs ( see Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ), and because they differentially regulate the specific gating properties of skeletal muscle calcium currents

. The general principle derived from our modeling and mutagenesis experiments is that stabilization of VSDs in the activated state supports channel opening by shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarizing potentials. On the other hand, ion-bond formation between the gating charges and the ENC in resting states delays channel opening by slowing down the activation kinetics. Interestingly, at least in CaV1. 1, these actions are divided between separate VSDs

. 1e ( Tanabe et al., 1988; Tuluc et al., 2009 ), expressed them in their native environment in dysgenic myotubes and examined the effects on the gating properties of its calcium currents ( Figure 4A ). The structure of the VSDs in general and in particular the studied residues are highly conserved in CaV channels ( Wu et al., 2016 )

. Particularly, the sequential movement of the gating charges across the HCS and the stabilization of the states by their transient formation of ion pairs with negatively charged amino acids of the INC were similarly observed in VSDs I and IV. Evidently, these features represent highly conserved properties of voltage-gated cation channels ( prokaryotic and eukaryotic ) and probably define the essence of the voltage sensing mechanism

., 2017; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) enabled the determination of the structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1. 1 at 3. 6 Å resolution, displaying a closed pore and the VSDs in the activated up-state ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015 ). Very recently, three cryo-EM structures of homo-tetrameric sodium channels experimentally locked in resting ( or VSD-down ) states have been reported ( Wisedchaisri et al

., 2016a ). The rabbit skeletal muscle CaV1. 1 is the first member of the CaV family for which the structure has been solved ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019 ). Biophysically it is characterized by slow kinetics and right-shifted voltage dependence of activation ( Tuluc et al., 2016a ). Together these attributes make CaV1

. However, because high-resolution structures of resting states of CaV channels are lacking, the molecular details of the steps leading up to VSD activation are still elusive. Exploiting the potential of structure modeling to fill this gap ( Jensen et al., 2012; Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 ), we applied MD simulation and MSM of individual VSDs to predict the structures, kinetics, and energy levels of resting states

. The additionally formed ion pairs in the resting states of VSD I are paralleled by a remarkable increase in the energy barriers and the state transition times, suggesting that the number and strength of interactions between the gating charges and the ENC transiently formed in the resting states determine the slow activation kinetics of VSD I. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we simultaneously mutated both countercharges, E87 and E90, to alanine ( E87A/E90A ) in the rabbit GFP-CaV1

., 2017 ). While this model describes the principal mode of voltage sensor action, without further structure-function data, it does not explain how the four homologous but structurally distinct VSDs of eukaryotic channels cooperate in channel gating and how the unique gating properties of different channel isoforms are achieved

., 2016a ). Together these attributes make CaV1. 1 a prime candidate for studying how specific structural features of the VSDs determine voltage dependence and kinetics of channel activation

. Thus, the structures derived from our simulations provide mechanistic explanations for how CaV channels determine their unique gating properties. Notably, the differences of the transition kinetics observed in the MSM analysis between VSDs I and IV, and between WT VSD I and the E87A and E90A were manifested in the activating and deactivating direction ( Figures 2, 4 and 5 )

Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular functions, such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene regulation. These channels have distinct properties, such as activation voltage and kinetics, which are determined by their voltage-sensing domains (VSD). Researchers used a combination of modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, energy, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct VSDs of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1. They found that both VSD displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed kinetics. This provides a mechanistic model explaining how ionair formation in VSD can realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.

    Title: Optimal level activity of matrix metalloproteinases is critical for adult visual plasticity in the healthy and stroke-affected brain
    Abstract: The ability of the adult brain to undergo plastic changes is of particular interest in medicine, especially regarding recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex ( V1 ) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.

    Supporting Text:
   . In conclusion, our present data highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity. They further suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which in turn can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP-activity therefore seems to be essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke

. In addition, a single treatment after the S1-stroke rescued plasticity in both paradigms, whereas treatment with the inhibitor two times diminished plasticity-promoting effect. Together, these data reveal a crucial role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur.

The objective of this study was to examine if MMPs are crucial for adult visual plasticity, and if inhibition of their upregulation following cortical stroke may be beneficial for rescuing lost plasticity. A combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests revealed that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur in the healthy and stroke-affected brain

., 2012 ). Together, our new data demonstrate a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, in particular for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after MD, and notably expand the previous studies from juvenile rats. Under normal conditions, MMP-activity supports healthy brain development and function; yet a different outcome of MMP action has been described for diseased brain ( Agrawal et al., 2008 )

., 2008 ). Furthermore, increased MMP-activity was observed within 24 hours of a photothrombotically ( PT ) induced stroke, and application of a broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor at the time of the stroke partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity ( Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011; Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012 ). Here we tested if the stroke-induced impairment of visual cortical plasticity ( Greifzu et al., 2011 ) can be rescued by inhibiting MMPs after stroke

., 2008; Chang et al., 2014 ). Together with the results from healthy animals, our data suggest that the plasticity-promoting effects of MMPs are dependent on a well-balanced level of activation, and if that balance is disturbed, experience-induced plastic changes are compromised. There are several plausible mechanisms by which MMP-inhibition rescues OD-plasticity after stroke in S1. Stroke influences brain function in numerous ways e. g

. In healthy adult mice, MMP-inhibition with GM6001 prevented both ocular dominance plasticity and experience-driven improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD, indicating that MMP-activation is required for normal adult plasticity. In addition, blockade of elevated MMP-activity after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity

., 2012 ) and MMP3-deficient mice displayed abnormal neuronal morphology in the visual cortex and impaired plasticity induced by long-term monocular enucleation ( Aerts et al., 2014 ). Here, we used a different approach to probe the role of MMPs in experience-induced changes in the visual system: we performed the experiments in wild type mice and treated them with the broad-spectrum inhibitor GM6001 or vehicle during 7 days of MD

., 2011; Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012 ). Thus, the second goal of our study was to test whether balancing the upregulated MMPs resulting from a focal stroke in S1 would rescue visual plasticity. Using a combination of in vivo optical imaging of intrinsic signals and behavioral vision tests in adult mice, we observed that application of the broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001 during the 7-day MD-period prevented both OD-plasticity and enhancements of the optomotor response of the open eye

. 001, Figure 6B ). Altogether, these data show that brief inhibition of MMPs after the induction of a cortical stroke lesion completely rescued experience-induced enhancements in both the spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD. This finding also suggests that upregulated MMPs in the immediate post-injury period can have a detrimental influence on interocular plasticity in adult mice.

. 10. 7554/eLife. 11290. 010Figure 5. Brief MMP-inhibition after a stroke in S1 rescued experience-dependent plasticity in V1. Quantification of the imaging data, layout and data display as in Figure 2

., 2011; Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012 ). Here we tested whether inhibition of upregulated MMP-activity ( resulting from PT-stroke ) may rescue cortical plasticity also when the treatment starts after lesion induction. Indeed, a single GM6001-treatment after PT in the neighboring S1 fully rescued plasticity in both of our experimental paradigms, OD- and interocular plasticity

. Specifically, a single but not two-times treatment with GM6001 after a cortical PT-lesion in the neighboring S1 region fully rescued experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in adult V1, which is normally lost under these conditions. These observations suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window to allow visual plasticity: if MMP-activity is downregulated ( with inhibitors ) or upregulated ( after stroke ) experience-induced plastic changes are compromised

. 05, Figure 2B ), indicating that the deprived, contralateral eye still dominated V1. This absence of any detectable OD-shift during MMP-inhibition strongly suggests a crucial role of MMPs for mediating visual cortical plasticity in the adult brain. 10. 7554/eLife. 11290. 004Figure 2. Inhibition of MMPs during the MD-period prevented adult OD-plasticity

., 2007; Greifzu et al., 2011 ) : in 3-month-old mice, a focal stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) prevented both V1-plasticity and improvements of the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye ( Greifzu et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, some MMPs were shown to be upregulated within the first 24 hours after focal stroke ( Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011; Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012 )

. Together, our behavioral vision tests indicate an essential role for MMPs in this cortex-dependent interocular plasticity paradigm: MMP-inhibition completely abolished the experience-enabled improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye. 10. 7554/eLife. 11290. 006Figure 3. Inhibition of MMPs prevented experience-enabled enhancements of both the spatial frequency ( A ) and contrast sensitivity ( B ) thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye in adult mice after MD

. In a healthy brain, the enzymatic activity of MMPs has plasticity promoting effects ( Milward et al., 2007; Huntley, 2012 ). Consequently to increased neuronal activity, activated MMPs can lessen physical barriers ( loosen up the ECM ) or via the degradation of certain receptors influence signaling pathways. Such changes within neuronal cells and their synapses thereby alter the structure and activity of neuronal networks ( Milward et al., 2007; Huntley, 2012 )

. Although, we observed clear functional rescue of OD-plasticity after GM6001-treatment, there was no apparent effect on the lesion size: the PT-lesions in GM6001-treated mice were not smaller compared to vehicle-injected mice. This is in line with a recent observation, that a different broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor ( FN-143 ) did not attenuate brain damage resulting from photothrombosis, but partially rescued barrel cortex plasticity ( Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011 )

    Title: Auxiliary subunits keep AMPA receptors compact during activation and desensitization
    Abstract: Signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses involves the rapid activation of AMPA ( α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate ) receptors, glutamate-gated ion channels whose four subunits assemble as a dimer-of-dimers. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy brought a slew of full-length structures of AMPA receptors, on their own and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures indicate that dimers might undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, opening up the extracellular layer along the central twofold symmetry axis. We used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations found in functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Our data indicate that extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can get trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, extracellular domains of AMPA receptors likely stay compact during gating.

    Supporting Text:
   . We conclude that extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead work in a fairly compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions.

., 2012; Jackson and Nicoll, 2011 ). We therefore wondered if the presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin ( Stg ), could affect conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors. Recently, cryo-EM structures of AMPA receptors in complex with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active and desensitized states ( Figure 1B ) ( Chen et al., 2017; Twomey et al., 2017a )

. However, the structural dynamics underlying their rapid signaling are unclear. AMPA receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels. Ignoring their intracellular regions, they consist of three layers formed from distinct domains ( Figure 1A ). The two extracellular layers assemble from amino-terminal domains and ligand-binding domains, ATDs and LBDs, respectively. These adopt local dimer pairs in resting and active receptors

., 2013; Salazar et al., 2017 ). Assuming that the length of the bis-MTS cross-linkers reflects level of structural rearrangements and following the trend plotted in Figure 4H, this suggests that AMPA receptors at synapses, exposed to brief glutamate transients and in complex with auxiliary subunits, are unlikely to undergo extreme conformational changes

Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revolutionized the study of membrane proteins, and the supply of structural information is greater than ever before. However, as the catalogue of images swells, the need to relate their geometry to dynamics becomes more pressing. In case of AMPA receptors, full-length structures in complexes with various ligands and auxiliary subunits have been published

., 2007; Elegheert et al., 2016 ). When in complex with auxiliary subunits, no functional state of AMPA receptors necessitates large domain movements, and compact arrangements of the extracellular layer can sustain the gating process

. This kinetic classification suggests AMPA receptors at synapses probably have similar, compact geometries regardless of their instantaneous gating state.

. Trapping with bis-MTS cross-linkers so far indicated more conformational flexibility of the LBD layer in desensitized than activated AMPA receptors. However, synaptic AMPA receptors are rarely expressed alone and are instead associated with various auxiliary proteins that re-define their kinetic properties ( Schwenk et al., 2012; Jackson and Nicoll, 2011 )

The rupture of the LBD intra-dimer interface is a structural hallmark of AMPA receptor desensitization, as shown by biophysical studies based on the structures of isolated ligand binding domains ( Sun et al., 2002; Armstrong et al., 2006 ). Several cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) structures of full-length receptors ( Nakagawa et al., 2005; Dürr et al., 2014; Meyerson et al

. However, long exposures to agonists are at odds with synaptic conditions where AMPA receptors see glutamate on a millisecond timescale, before it is actively cleared by transporters ( Clements, 1996 ). Furthermore, any large structural rearrangements of the extracellular domains would need to be accommodated by the crowded synaptic environment ( High et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2018 ) and potential presynaptic interaction partners ( Saglietti et al., 2007; Elegheert et al., 2016 )

. We therefore set out to investigate the conformational range of agonist-bound AMPA receptors with the aim of distinguishing frequently-visited, short-lived conformations from the long-lived ones that likely have less direct relevance to synaptic transmission. Previously, we demonstrated disulphide bonds and metal bridges trapping receptors in compact, as opposed to ‘open’ LBD arrangements ( Salazar et al., 2017; Baranovic et al., 2016; Lau et al., 2013 )

AMPA-type glutamate receptors are found at excitatory synapses throughout the mammalian brain, where they convert glutamate release into membrane depolarization. Their fast kinetics ( Colquhoun et al., 1992; Geiger et al., 1995; Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000 ), as well as the physical attributes of synapses ( Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003 ), allow them to follow glutamate transients at rates above 100 Hz

., 2006 ). Structural models of full-length AMPA receptors in various states of activity do not explain why every restraint of the LBD dimers leads to a decrease in activity. Either the correct sites for potentiation have not yet been found, or this observation reflects a mechanistic detail of receptor activation. The mechanism behind this inhibition remains frustratingly unclear, limiting the interpretation of the cross-linking approach used in this study

. In Figure 8A–B, the trapping profiles of V666C receptors with the available structural models of GluA2 in the equivalent condition are compared. The shallow trapping profile of desensitized AMPA receptors indicates a structural ensemble of conformations broadly in agreement with multiple desensitized states ( Meyerson et al., 2014; Robert and Howe, 2003 )

., 2013 ). These results demonstrate that limiting V666C separation of desensitized AMPA receptors to 18 Å causes inhibition, indicating further separation of the residues is possible, in good agreement with cryo-EM structures ( Meyerson et al., 2014; Dürr et al., 2014 ). In addition to positions 665 and 666, we also tested nearby positions 662 and 664 for their sensitivity to bis-MTS cross-linkers ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

., 2014; Robert and Howe, 2003 ). Even though the LBD dimer-dimer separation observed in the model ( > 18 Å, EMDB: 2688 ) was not tested with the bis-MTS cross-linker of the corresponding length, extrapolation of the trapping profile indicates such conformations are available to desensitized AMPA receptors

. The progressive inability of the receptors to recover from trapping with longer cross-linkers indicates increasingly stable trapped states corresponding to greater separation of the cross-linked subunits in the desensitized state ( Figure 4G–H ). Desensitized AMPA receptors with a disulphide bridge formed between the two V666C residues at inter-dimer interface fit in well with this trend, recovering in seconds following 100 s exposure to the oxidizing agent CuPhen ( Figure 4H )

. Here, we have used a classical crosslinking approach allied to rapid perfusion to measure distances up to 18 Å in AMPA receptor extracellular domains across different functional states and in the time domain. Bis-MTS cross-linkers have been used previously to aid identification of movements underlying state transitions in AMPA and NMDA receptors ( Armstrong et al., 2006; Tajima et al., 2016 )

. In AMPA receptors without Stg, with desensitization blocked, the activity of only two subunits produces subconductance openings with short open times ( Rosenmund et al., 1998 ). But the presence of Stg ( Coombs et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014 ) increases the current carried by receptors with one or two active subunits. In our experiments, Stg had an indefatigable effect of maintaining receptor activity in the limit of long exposures to bis-MTS

. To assess the effect of different bifunctional cross-linkers on AMPA receptors, the receptors were exposed to the cross-linker ( 1 µM ) for 1 min. Before and after this trapping exposure, the current in the patch was tested with control pulses that contained only 10 mM glutamate, without the cross-linker and in the presence of 10 mM glutamate with the crosser ( Figure 3A–B ). In the presence of the crosser, the current was significantly reduced compared to the control ( Figure 3A ), indicating that the crosser trapped the receptors in a conformation that was less conductive to glutamate binding. In contrast, in the absence of the crosser, the current was similar to the control ( Figure 3B ), indicating that the receptors were not trapped in a conformation that was less conductive to glutamate

In the presence of the crosser, the current was significantly reduced compared to the control ( Figure 3 ) indicating that the cross trapped receptors in a conformation was less conductive to glutamate. In contrast, in absence the cross the current was similar to control ( Figure ) indicating receptors not trapped conformation less conduct to glutamate

In the presence of cross the current was reduced to control ( ) indicating cross trapped receptors conformation less conduct glutamate. In contrast absence cross current similar control ( ) receptors not trapped conformation conduct glut

    Title: High-dimensional analysis of intestinal immune cells during helminth infection
    Abstract: Single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult, due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling and immune cell infiltration. Through the systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol, we were able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we analyzed them using a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy. Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.

   . To understand these differences and validate whether our protocol was suitable for subsequent single cell analysis and immunophenotyping, we characterized the isolated cells further using a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel that incorporated many of the hallmark surface and intracellular markers for type two immune responses that have been associated with helminth infections ( Maizels and McSorley, 2016; Reynolds et al

. Thus, our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to characterize many known hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. We were able to validate these changes using confocal microscopy and while we could observe differences in the reported cell ratios, changes between naïve and infected samples were faithfully reported by both approaches

. Importantly, many of these changes were only observed locally, highlighting the requirement for good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly

., 2010 ) ( Figure 2e ). To validate that our cell isolation protocol resulted in an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we quantified B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4- and CD64+ cells using confocal microscopy ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5a–c ) and compared their frequency to our spectral flow cytometry data

Difficulties with intestinal digests during helminth infection have been associated with a strong anti-parasite type 2 immune response that drives mucus production ( Hashimoto et al., 2009; von Moltke et al., 2016 ), alters the epithelium ( Gerbe et al., 2016; Howitt et al., 2016 ), induces immune cell infiltration ( Inclan-Rico and Siracusa, 2018 ) and causes tissue remodelling ( Motran et al., 2018; Boyett and Hsieh, 2014 ) ( Figure 1c )

. In addition to flow cytometric immunophenotyping, we were also able to extract high-quality RNA from cells isolated with our protocol, which could accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses through current single-cell analysis tools, such as single cell RNA sequencing, which has previously been unfeasible.

. First, we modified the EDTA wash steps to remove the increased amount of mucus but did not observe an improvement in cell yield ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion protocols #1, 2, 6 ). This was followed by testing a variety of collagenases that have been reported for intestinal digests, as we hypothesized that the intestinal remodeling that occurred during helminth infection could negatively impact the digestion procedure

Another important conclusion from our analysis was that the strong inflammatory immune responses that we had observed during H

. To further optimize the protocol, we focused on Collagenase A-based digestion and increased and modified the wash steps and observed a further increase in cell yield ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2; digestion protocols #9–12 ). Importantly, strong vortexing after each wash step significantly improved the outcome of digestion ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2; digestion protocol #13 ), suggesting that the epithelium is harder to remove in helminth-infected tissues

The standard digestion procedure to isolate intestinal immune cells located in the small intestinal lamina propria consists of three steps ( Weigmann et al., 2007; Reißig et al., 2014; Scott et al

. We observed that the frequencies of B220+, CD3+ CD4+, and CD64+ cells were highly comparable between confocal microscopy and spectral flow cytometry, while Siglec F+ cells were overrepresented in our spectral flow cytometry data and CD3+ CD4- cells were underrepresented. However, changes within immune cell populations at the peak of H

. We also assessed intra-epithelial cells in the EDTA wash, but could not detect any CD45+ cells in preparations from infected animals, emphasizing that our protocol should only be used to isolate lamina propria cells. Several intestinal cell isolation protocols also utilize a final gradient centrifugation step to further isolate immune cells ( Weigmann et al., 2007; Esterházy et al., 2019 )

. Individual duodenum draining mesenteric lymph nodes were identified as the most proximal lymph nodes of the mesenteric lymph node chain ( Esterházy et al., 2019; Mayer et al., 2017 ), and were digested with 100 µg/mL Liberase TL and 100 µg/mL DNase I ( both from Roche, Germany ) for 30 min at 37°C and passed through a 70 µm cell strainer.

In order to investigate a model of both acute and chronic helminth infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( also known as Heligmosomoides bakeri; Behnke and Harris, 2010 ), a naturally occurring rodent parasite with an exclusive intestinal life cycle ( Monroy and Enriquez, 1992; Reynolds et al., 2012 )

. 05 mg/ml DNase ( see Appendix 1 for step-by-step instructions ). When we compared intestinal digests from naïve animals using the standard or optimized cell isolation protocol, we observed highly comparable outcomes ( Figure 1d; digestion protocols #1 and 13 ). Both digestion protocols resulted in a cell yield of 3–6 million live cells per duodenum with 70–80% viability and 20–30% frequency of CD45+ cells

. We observed that samples from all time points could be successfully digested using our optimized digestion protocol and that duodenal digests from 14- and 28 days post infection yielded 3–6 million live cells per sample ( Figure 1e, f ). We furthermore observed a consistent doubling of the cell count to 8–11 million live cells per duodenum at day seven post infection and observed a similar trend when we quantified CD45+ cells in cryosections from these time points ( Figure 1f, g )

., 2012; Smith et al., 2016 ). The peak of acute immunity is usually studied around day 14 post infection and we focused on this time point and the heavily infected duodenum ( Filbey et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2008 ), to optimize our digestion protocol. In order to develop a digestion protocol for heavily infected intestines, we followed a systematic approach and optimized each step of the standard intestinal digestion protocol

. In line with previous findings ( Inclan-Rico and Siracusa, 2018 ), we observed a strong infiltration of immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes at day 7 post infection, which we verified by confocal microscopy and were primarily localized around the developing larvae explaining the increase in total cell number at this timepoint ( Figure 2a–c and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 )

Recent advances in single cell analysis have significantly increased our understanding of multiple diseases and cell types in different tissues ( Svensson et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2018 ). However, many of these technologies require single cell suspensions as an input, which limits our assessment of difficult-to-process tissues ( Hwang et al., 2018; Nguyen et al. 2017 ) such as the intestinal lamina propria, where cells are embedded in a complex matrix of mucus and epithelial cells. To overcome this limitation, we optimized a protocol to isolate intestinal cells from heavily infected duodenum and characterized them using high-dimensional flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.

    Title: Quantitative time-resolved analysis reveals intricate, differential regulation of standard- and immuno-proteasomes
    Abstract: Proteasomal protein degradation is a key determinant of protein half-life and hence of cellular processes ranging from basic metabolism to a host of immunological processes. Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage.

    Supporting Text:
    Using tightly integrated experimental and computational modelling analyses, recent advances in our understanding of proteasome structure and function, and previous attempts at modelling proteasome dynamics ( Liepe et al., 2014a ), we elaborate the first comprehensive mathematical model that is able to describe the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes; and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides

. In this study we combine carefully designed experimental assays with detailed modelling to shed light on these mechanisms. There is a dearth of mechanistic analyses of proteasome functions, and the complexity of polypeptide hydrolysis has precluded detailed analysis ( Liepe et al., 2014a ). The most direct insights come from carefully chosen short fluorogenic peptides, which have a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site, which in turn allows us to follow the kinetics in real time

. We observe similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome as well as protein homogenates, where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by several regulatory molecules. It suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment

. Poly-ubiquitin tagging ( when it occurs ), transport and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein half-life and thereby affect the majority of metabolic processes in the cell. Despite considerable biochemical and structural efforts, the mechanisms of proteasomal action, in particular the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms, are only incompletely understood

. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its catalytic activity varies over time in a way that can only be understood if the structural characteristics of the proteasome are taken into account. Kinetics change over longer time scales than the structural dynamics described by Osmulski et al. ( 2009 ) and they are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites

. Our model therefore also provides an interpretative framework for general studies of proteasome action, keeping in mind that substrate-specific effects need to be accounted for ( Mishto et al., 2014 ). Simple ( e. g

. Modelling helps us to understand how the 20S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of specific proteins in cells ( Pickering and Davies, 2012; Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014; Höhn and Grune, 2014; Fabre et al., 2015 ) ; it also forms the basis for future studies of the main active forms of proteasome in cells, for example, when it is bound to the regulatory complexes 19S and PA28 ( Fabre et al., 2015 )

. Here we apply a modelling approach to a detailed mechanistic analysis of proteasomes, which are at the core of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and responsible for the destruction of the majority of the cytoplasmic proteins. Proteins are usually tagged by E1-E2-E3-E4 enzyme-mediated poly-ubiquitination, carried into the proteasome proteolytic chamber where they are fragmented and, ultimately, expulsed ( Schwartz and Ciechanover, 2009 )

. Peptide accumulation over time leads to activation of non-catalytic modifier sites, which our analysis shows to be located inside the proteasome cavity. 10. 7554/eLife. 07545. 025Box 2. Filling kinetics of the proteasome inner cavity over time. A key part of the peptide transport dynamics is the maximum capacity ( C ) of the two proteasome ante-chambers and the main chamber

., 2014a ). In mammals different 20S proteasome isoforms exist, which carry different catalytic β subunits. Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as IFN-γ the catalytic standard β1, β2 and β5 subunits peculiar of the standard proteasome ( s-proteasome ) are replaced by the immuno-subunits β1i, β2i and β5i in the newly synthesized immunoproteasome ( i-proteasome ). Proteasome isoforms degrade substrates with different rates, but generate the same peptide pool ( Mishto et al., 2014 )

. We focus on the dynamics of the digestion of a set of exemplar peptides, and show that this process is regulated carefully and by three distinct mechanisms, that act in concert to regulate proteasomal activity. Here considering different mechanisms, coupled to state-of-the art statistical model selection techniques ( Kirk et al., 2013 ), allows us to elucidate steps in the proteasomal dynamics that cannot be probed directly through experiments

. However, under physiological conditions the actual number of molecules that can be filled in the proteasome cavity has to be smaller, which is reflected in our model estimates. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07545. 025 Substrate transport through the gate and cavities must therefore be a key factor in the regulation of the proteolytic process, despite the fact that it had been largely neglected so far in the quantitative analysis of proteasome dynamics ( Liepe et al

. The outcomes of our integrative analysis suggest that the i-proteasome also has a higher affinity for the enhancing non-catalytic modifier site activated by all three substrates; given that our model consistently predicts this site to be located at the inner surface, it should now become possible to determine the precise location of the enhancer site using structural techniques. Our model is a necessary and non-trivial step towards understanding protein degradation by proteasomes

. What is already clear is that the complex interactions between a suitable complicated substrate and the proteasomal machinery will substantially shape differences in degradation rates between proteins; as the protein degradation rate is known to influence for example, noise in signal transduction, a way to understand and rationally interfere with this process is of obvious importance.

. Different steps of the proteolysis process may be responsible for isoform specific kinetics: transport of the substrate through the gate and the antechambers; binding to substrate binding sites and ensuing peptide-bond hydrolysis ( Huber et al., 2012; Arciniega et al., 2014 ) ; and the release from the substrate binding sites and finally from the proteasome gate

. The question is also of direct medical relevance: different degradation kinetics of specific substrates by s- and i-proteasomes, or i-proteasome carrying genetic polymorphisms/mutations, have been suggested to be involved in a variety of pathologies ( Basler et al., 2013; Bellavista et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, i-proteasome deficient mice show altered proteasome-dependent kinetics of pathogen epitope generation ( Basler et al., 2013 )

., 2014 ). Simple ( e. g., MM-type ) models, which have been largely used in analysing proteasome functionality so far, are clearly not capable of describing proteasome dynamics; this is becoming apparent since time-course data is much less forgiving and harder to fit to than for example, dose-response curves

. As we show below the insights gained from the short fluorogenic peptides are borne out by further analysis of polypeptides. The mechanistic analyses performed here also incorporate known structural features into a mathematical model of proteasome action. The 20S proteasome consists of four stacked seven membered rings ( denoted by α7β7β7α7 )

., 2012 ). By contrast, the catalytic sites of s-proteasome have stronger binding affinity for the substrate Z-LLE-MCA than the i-proteasome, which could be explained by the structural differences between β1 and β1i catalytic pockets described by Huber et al. ( 2012 ). For the degradation of the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA our model predicts that the i-proteasome has higher substrate-binding affinity, higher hydrolysis rate, and lower cooperativity than the s-proteasome

. Our analysis suggests that the cavity of 20S proteasomes is progressively filled by peptides that can further facilitate other molecules to enter the proteolytic chamber. The transport of substrates into the proteome is the rate-limiting step of the hydrolysis. The efficiency of this transport varies between s- and i-proteomes thereby affecting total degradation and cleavage-site usage.

    Title: The β-alanine transporter BalaT is required for visual neurotransmission in Drosophila
    Abstract: The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia, and is converted to carcinine. After delivered back to photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. This histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, but it is unclear how the β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells. Here, we identified a new β-alanine transporter, which we named BalaT ( Beta-alanine Transporter ). Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine, as well as less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. Moreover, BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.

   . Therefore, we suggest that a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle β-alanine. Disrupting the synthesis of histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission ( Borycz et al., 2002; Burg et al., 1993 ). The transport of β-alanine seems less important, as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila

. Therefore, β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. In addition, establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool play key roles in sustaining visual synaptic transmission. The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila compound eye

. The finding that high levels of β-alanine are detected in retinal pigment cells suggested that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine in this system ( Borycz et al., 2012; Chaturvedi et al., 2014 ). To address these questions, we sought to determine whether there was a β-alanine transporter that was required for Drosophila vision transmission

., 2012; Ziegler et al., 2013 ). Therefore, an efficient β-alanine recycling systems has been proposed to compensate for the rapid loss of β-alanine that occurs in the conversion of histamine to carcinine ( Borycz et al., 2012 ). Here we show that mutations in balat disrupted transport and storage of β-alanine in the retina, resulting in dramatically reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior

., 1993 ). This suggests a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. Our current work, together with previous reports, provides evidence for the formulation of a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission ( Figure 6 ). In this pathway, carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells within the optic lamina, and is transported back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft

. Here, we identified BalaT, which is a plasma membrane transporter capable to transporting β-alanine into cells. Mutations in the balat gene disrupted photoreceptor synaptic transmission, phototaxis behaviors, and contents and retinal distribution of β-alanine. BalaT expression in retinal pigment cells completely rescued the defective visual transmission of balat mutants

. Although electron microscopy studies in Drosophila have not revealed gap junctions between retinal pigment cells and laminar fenestrated glia, accumulation of β-alanine in the retinal layer of inx1/inx3 double mutant flies indicates defective β-alanine trafficking. BalaT belongs to the SLC22 family of transporters, which mediate sodium-independent transport of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and energy metabolites ( Koepsell, 2013 )

., 2002; Richardt et al., 2002 ). In photoreceptors, CarT and Tan are involved in transporting carcinine and regenerating histamine, respectively ( Chaturvedi et al., 2016; Stenesen et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015 ). Histamine is then loaded into synaptic vesicles, but fate of the β-alanine generated by Tan remains unknown. Here, we identify a new β-alanine transporter, BalaT, and provide evidence that BalaT is required for visual transmission

. Our work provides strong genetic evidence for the involvement of retinal pigment cells in histamine recycling, and suggests that BalaT is the key player responsible for the transport of β-alanine into pigment cell

. Furthermore, the gap junction proteins Inx1 and Inx3 were required in retinal pigment cells for visual neurotransmission. We therefore provide evidence for a novel β-alanine recycling pathway, in which β-alanine that is released from photoreceptor cells is taken up and stored by retinal pigment cells, and then delivered to laminar glia via gap junctions, where histamine is inactivated by conjugation with β-alanine.

. Once in the photoreceptor cells it is hydrolyzed into histamine and β-alanine by Tan, and histamine is used as neurotransmitter. Meanwhile, β-alanine is released via an unknown mechanism, and is subsequently delivered to and stored within pigment cells by BalaT. Finally, β-alanine is transported back to epithelial glia through the network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia for histamine inactivation and carcinine synthesis. 10. 7554/eLife. 29146. 024Figure 6

. Among ~600 putative transmembrane transporters encoded by the Drosophila genome, we identified 20 head-enriched genes ( Table 1 ) that represented potential β-alanine transporters ( Figure 1A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 29146. 003Figure 1. CG3790 is a retina-enriched β-alanine transporter. ( A ) Screening for a β-alanine transporter

. We provide evidence that BalaT functions specifically in pigment cells as a β-alanine transporter, as BalaT mediated β-alanine transport in vitro, and is expressed predominately in retinal pigment cells. The reduced levels and altered distribution of β-alanine in the heads of balat null mutant flies supports this hypothesis. β-alanine is one of the two constituents of the naturally occurring dipeptides, carnosine and carcinine, and is considered rate-limiting for their synthesis

., 2014 ) ( Figure 5C and F ). In contrast, levels of β-alanine were lower in balat1 sections ( for comparison, retinal signals were normalized to the β-alanine signal in the lobula ) ( Figure 5D and F ). GMR-balat restored retinal β-alanine levels in balat1 mutants ( Figure 5E and F ), and rescued photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Reduced levels of β-alanine in retina lacking BalaT support the hypothesis that BalaT transports β-alanine into retinal pigment cells

. It has been suggested that the transportation of histamine metabolites within the Drosophila visual system is mediated by a network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia that are interconnected by gap junctions, and that this transport network is essential for fly vision ( Chaturvedi et al., 2014 ). However, histaminergic photoreceptor cells directly acquire carcinine from synaptic terminals within the optic lamina through a CarT-dependent trafficking pathway ( Xu et al., 2015 )

. These results indicate that BalaT functions in pigment cells, and that pigment cells may play an important role in transporting β-alanine from photoreceptors to epithelia glial cells in the optic lamina. If β-alanine is transported into pigment cell by BalaT, it must then be transported from the pigment cells to the laminar glial cells, where it can be conjugated with histamine to form carcinine

. BalaT is a plasma membrane protein, and is sufficient to facilitate β-alanine uptake in cultured cells. BalaT is expressed predominantly by retinal pigment cells, and the specific expression of BalaT in these cells rescues photoreceptor synaptic transmission in balat1 mutant flies. The reduced levels and altered distribution of β-alanine in the heads of balat1 mutants support the hypothesis that BalaT functions to transport β-alanine

. Thus, we propose that Balat plays a key role in shuttling β-alanine from photoreceptor cells to glial cells. A similar recycling system has been demonstrated for histamine. Mutations in Hdc ( histidine decarboxylase ) result in the loss of visual transduction. Feeding these flies histamine fully restores the visual transduction, whereas supplying histamine fails to rescue the ERG phenotypes of ebony mutants or Hdc;ebony double mutant flies ( Melzig et al., 1996, 1998; Ziegler et al

. It is not currently known how β-alanine is returned to the lamin glial cells from the photoreceptors. We propose that β-al is transported into retinal cells by Bala and then delivered to lamin glial cells via gap junctions, where it is conjugated with histamine to form carcinine.
Researchers have discovered that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, where almost 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins are oxidized before cell death. Contrary to the free radical theory of aging, this collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but by a drop in NAD levels, which normally provides electrons for cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NAD occurs early in lifespan and sets off a cascade that downregulates cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD and delays each facet of the cascade. Studies reveal a timeline of events leading to system-wide oxidation of the proteome before cell death.

The researchers used chronologically aging S. cerevisiae to determine onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in postmit aging cells. By monitoring thiol status of 300 proteins, they found cells undergo global red collapse leading to thiol oxidation in 80% of proteins days before death. They also uncovered protein targets whose oxidative thiol modifications contribute to physiological alterations in aging. Chronological lifespan S. cerevisiae represents a model for aging postmit cells.

Results suggest early changes in NAD levels trigger initial oxidation of thioreductase and changes in cellular red potential, leading to red collapse in postmit yeast. Cultivation under caloric conditions delays decrease in NAD, delays red collapse of proteome, and extends lifespan. Researchers used quantitative proteomic approach to assess redox events in non-dividing cells, chronologically S. cerevisiae as model. Downregulation of translation contributes to oxidative stress and extends lifespan in replicative yeast and other organisms.

Caloric restriction increases chronological lifespan in yeast, significantly. Molecular mechanism not elucidated, but trait among calorically restricted is increased stress. Study used chronologically S. It is tempting to speculate reversible thiol in chron aging cells represent 'pro' response to protect proteins against damage and extend lifespan. Analysis GSH/GSS ratio in chron aging cells, dependent on NPH glutathione reductase, prooxid shift coincided with decrease N levels. Before prooxid shift delayed in calorically growth. Importantly, oxidation delayed caloric and hypometabolic conditions suggest maintenance red homeostasis contribute extending regimens.

    Title: Mechanism of chiral proofreading during translation of the genetic code
    Abstract: The biological macromolecular world is homochiral and effective enforcement and perpetuation of this homochirality is essential for cell survival. In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase ( DTD ) from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. While no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD’s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study thus provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus.

    Supporting Text:
   . Such a side chain-free recognition mechanism provides the basis for how nature has designed a single deacylase to deal with any D-aa-tRNA and reveals the crucial role played by weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection. If an L-aa was to bind in this pocket, it would have to do so in one of the three theoretically possible conformations shown in Figure 4

The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselective mechanism involved in enforcement of homochirality in proteins by specifically decoupling D-aas from tRNAs. The earlier structural studies on DTD provided a mechanistic model based either on docking approaches using apo structure ( Lim et al., 2003 ) or complex structures with ligands that do not mimic the cognate substrate ( Bhatt et al., 2010 )

., 1999; Dock-Bregeon et al., 2004 ). However, a freestanding enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase ( DTD ) removes D-amino acids ( D-aas ) mischarged on tRNAs and ensures that D-aas do not get incorporated into proteins ( Calendar and Berg, 1967; Wydau et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2009 ). Since DTDs act in trans as freestanding modules, they are most likely to operate through resampling by recapturing aminoacyl-tRNAs ( aa-tRNAs ) from EF-Tu ( Ling et al., 2009 )

. A striking feature of the amino acid recognition site is the capture of all the atoms attached to the chiral centre Cα and the role of cross-subunit interactions, particularly a Gly-cisPro motif from both monomers inserted into the active site of the dimeric counterpart that plays a central role in the recognition mechanism, as described in ‘Mechanism of L-amino acid rejection from the active site’. The aminoacyl moiety has interactions with residues from both monomers

. Considering that in the actual substrate, the D-amino acid would be linked to the tRNA, a multiple binding mode is highly improbable as the orientation and position of the D-amino acid would be fixed by the binding of terminal adenosine.

. The rejection mechanism also rules out any other possible mode of D-aa binding than the one observed where the side chain is kept protruding out ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01519. 017Figure 4. Mechanism of L-chirality rejection. The cross-subunit Gly-cisPro motif is shown in brown. ( A ) Stereoscopic representation showing the conformation of D-amino acid observed in the pocket. ( B ) The adenosine moiety and the carbonyl oxygen are tightly fixed

. As we show later, this transesterification is required for DTD to act since it is expected to recognize aminoacyl moiety only when it is attached to the 3′-OH. A comparison of non-cognate and cognate substrate analog-bound structures of Pab-NTD had revealed that the space available in the reaction zone is crucial for catalysis. It was shown that upon cognate substrate binding this space is constricted due to a subtle movement of a crucial Lys side chain ( Hussain et al., 2010 )

., 2000b ). The problem is further compounded by the very high excess of L-aa-tRNA over D-aa-tRNA in the cellular milieu and warrants a stringent D-configuration specificity to avoid depletion of L-aa-tRNA pool. Although biochemical studies have indicated its configurational preference, the mechanistic basis of this fundamental process remained elusive due to lack of a cognate substrate-bound complex structure. The first crystal structure of DTD from E

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01519. 016 To delineate the catalytic mechanism, we looked for all the amino acid side chains located within a distance of 6 Å from the susceptible bond of the substrate, that is the bond between adenosine and the carbonyl group of D-tyrosine. These residues include Ser87, Gln88, Phe89, Thr90, Met141, and Pro150. Out of these, the residues that can chemically contribute to catalysis are Ser87, Gln88, and Thr90, which are positioned at a distance of 5

. None of the D-amino acids is found to be located in the position where the chiral discrimination occurs ( the distance between Cα of the D-amino acids and Cα of D-Tyr3AA ranges from 3. 39 Å to 13. 94 Å ). The site of binding as well as the orientation of D-amino acids with respect to the enzyme is highly variable. In some cases, the carboxylate group points towards the enzyme, whereas in some cases it projects outward

. The only allowed flexibility would be the torsion around Cα-C′ bond. This rotation gives rise to three theoretical possibilities of binding an L-amino acid. ( C ) Conformation I: the side chain swaps positions with Hα, severe short contacts of the side chain atoms including Cβ with active site residues can be seen.

., 2005 ). Even some of the highly evolved present day aaRSs have been shown to be inherently weak in enantioselection, leading to the formation of D-aminoacyl-tRNAs ( D-aa-tRNAs ) ( Calendar and Berg, 1966; Soutourina et al., 2000b ). D-aa-tRNAs thus formed could either get incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain leading to global misfolding or get accumulated in the cell leading to depletion of tRNA pool

. The essential role of Gly-cisPro motif in chiral discrimination is also strongly indicated by its absolute invariance in all DTD sequences from eubacteria to higher eukaryotes ( Figure 8C ). Previous work has shown the ability of L-proline to catalyze asymmetric synthesis of simple sugars leading to their enantioenrichment ( Breslow and Cheng, 2010; Hein and Blackmond, 2012 )

. A mechanistically unique solution to the problem of enantioselectivity employing two carbonyl oxygens from a ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro dipeptide has been shown to be responsible for D-chirality selection and strict L-chirality rejection from the active site of DTD. The conserved and indispensable nature of the motif in DTD argues strongly for its crucial role in solving this key chiral discrimination problem in biology

. A similar mechanistic mode of operation of Pab-NTD delineates this DTD-like fold as a 3′-specific deacylase enzyme ( Hussain et al., 2006, 2010 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01519. 023Figure 6. DTD is a strict 3’-specific deacylase. ( A ) Ribose moiety of D-Tyr and the carbonyl group of Drosine are captured by the GlyisPro dipeptide. ( B ) The adenos moi and carbonyl oxygens of Dros are captured by Glyis dipeptide. The mechanism of chiral discrimination by Glyis dipeptide has been shown to be crucial for D-chir selection and Lir rejection from the active site of DTD. The mechanism of chiral discrimination by Glyis diptide has been shown to be crucial for D-ir selection and Lir rejection from the site of DTD. The mechanism of chiral discrimination by Glyis dipeptide has been shown to be crucial for D- selection and L rejection from the site of D. The mechanism of chiral discrimination by Gly dipeptide has been shown to be crucial for D selection and rejection from the site of D. The mechanism of chiral discrimination by dipeptide has been shown to be crucial for selection and rejection from the site of D. The mechanism of discrimination by diptide has been shown to be crucial for selection and rejection from the site of D. The mechanism discrimination by dipe has shown to be crucial for selection and rejection from the site of D. The discrimination di has shown to be crucial for selection and rejection from the site D.

    Title: Obligate coupling of CFTR pore opening to tight nucleotide-binding domain dimerization
    Abstract: In CFTR, the chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients, ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) opens the pore, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear. Here we correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. We show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2015 ). Thus, just as for ATP-bound channels, the pore is likely still closed in the high-energy evanescent transition state for spontaneous openings ( Figure 3a, center cartoon ). Finally, what can we infer about the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening? The presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations: rather ATP acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is a chloride ion channel which belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) proteins ( Riordan et al., 1989 ). Following phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory ( R ) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ), CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP ( Figure 1a )

. Such strict coupling between NBD and pore movements – regardless of the absence or presence of ATP – strongly constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating, and understanding of the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins. It also helps explain modulatory effects of mutations, or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators

. But in CFTR the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, so that an open-state 'binding affinity' cannot be defined ( the rates for both ATP binding and unbinding are zero ). Thus, even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium, that gating follows a reversible linear sequence ( cf., Figure 3a ), rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance

. Furthermore, although reported low-probability ATP-independent pore openings of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 ( CFTR residues 1–1197; [Wang et al., 2007] ) can clearly not be linked to NBD dimer formation, the present results argue that upon pore opening its remaining NBD-TMD coupling machinery undergoes movements similar to those that accompany NBD dimerization when neither 'limb' is truncated

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18164. 006 This double-mutant CFTR background allowed us to study, using the thermodynamic double mutant cycle formalism ( Materials and methods ), changes in energetic coupling associated with spontaneous gating between the same two NBD-interface side chains previously used ( Vergani et al., 2005 ) to demonstrate NBD dimer formation and disruption in CFTR channels opening and closing in ATP

. WT ). However, comparing gating parameters for spontaneous activity of WT CFTR and ATP-driven activity of hydrolysis-incompetent mutant CFTR channels offers some insight into the impact of ATP binding on gating energetics ( Figure 3c, gray vs. orange free energy profiles )

. For example, the G551D CF mutation converts ATP at site 2 into an inhibitory ligand, due to electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to the Walker motifs, and the introduced negative charge in the signature sequence ( Lin et al., 2014 ). Such an effect would not be expected if the opposing NBD interfaces did not approach each other in the open-channel state, but is readily explained by openings being strictly linked to NBD dimer formation even in the G551D mutant

. Because of the tightened NBD interface, the ATP binding sites of open CFTR channels are likely inaccessible to the bulk solution even in the absence of bound ATP, just as in its presence ( Chaves and Gadsby, 2015 ), suggesting that ATP binding/unbinding can take place only in the closed-channel state. Two immediate corollaries ensue. First, the ATP-free open-channel state is unlikely to be an integral component of the ATP-dependent gating cycle ( Szollosi et al., 2010; but, cf

While ATP-driven CFTR pore openings are known to be coupled to the formation of a tight NBD dimer ( Vergani et al., 2005 ), the mechanism of spontaneous openings, observable in the absence of ATP, is unknown. Here we show that spontaneous openings are also linked to tightening of the NBD interface around composite site 2, just as in the presence of bound ATP

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18164. 005 Wild-type ( WT ) CFTR channels open occasionally even in the absence of ATP ( Szollosi et al., 2010 ) ( Figure 1a, inset ), but it is unclear whether this reflects the occasional spontaneous formation of the NBD dimer ( Figure 1b, top ), or occasional pore openings independent of NBD dimerization ( Figure 1b, bottom ). The significance of this question goes beyond the scarcity of WT spontaneous openings

. The present results suggest a simple, unified explanation for all these findings: energetic stabilization or destabilization of the inherent open-channel-state structure ( Figure 3a, right ), which we show here is similarly organized in the absence or presence of ATP. Comparison of gating parameters for WT CFTR and our background mutant reveals the mechanism by which gain-of-function mutations promote spontaneous activity ( Figure 3c, black vs. orange free energy profiles )

. orange free energy profiles ). Mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis in site 2 all prolong τb and reduce CFTR gating to an equilibrium, by forcing the channels to close back through the same high-energy transition state they had traversed upon opening ( cf. Figure 3a ) ( Vergani et al., 2005; Csanády et al., 2010; Sorum et al., 2015 ). For instance, comparison of Po and τb of the site 2 Walker-A mutant K1250R CFTR in saturating ATP ( Po ~ 0. 6, τb = 9323 ms [Vergani et al

., 2010; but, cf. Jih et al., 2013 ). Second, despite suggested similarities ( Wang et al., 2010; Kirk et al., 2011; Okeyo et al., 2013 ), the principles that drive gating of CFTR channels are fundamentally different from those of ligand-gated channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor

., 2005 ). Thus, the only plausible explanation is a stabilizing interaction, consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond, in the spontaneous open state in WT channels that is lost in both single mutants, but is restored in the double mutant. The inevitable implication of these findings is that the NBD dimer interface must tighten within site 2 upon pore opening, whether or not bound ATP is present

., 2013 ). Moreover, ivacaftor, the only potentiator drug to be approved so far for clinical use in CF patients, acts by promoting such spontaneous, ATP-independent, openings of G551D CFTR, the third most common disease mutant ( Bompadre et al., 2007; Jih et al., 2013 ). However, mechanistic understanding of spontaneous gating has been limited by its vanishingly small open probability ( Po ), far too low to be reliably quantified ( Figure 1a )

., 2010 ). In contrast, ATP-evoked P355A-K978C CFTR currents were large already before exposure to PKA, and were little further enhanced by the addition of – or reduced following removal of – the kinase ( Figure 1c ), suggesting a large Po for unphosphorylated ( pre-PKA ) double-mutant channels in ATP, and close-to-maximal Po when the channels were either fully phosphorylated ( in PKA ) or partially dephosphorylated ( post-PKA )

. 6, τb = 9323 ms [Vergani et al., 2005] ) with those of spontaneously gating WT CFTR suggests that the presence of bound ATP stabilizes the open-channel state by ~10. 3 kT ( Figure 3c, right gray arrow ) and increases ΔΔG ( T−O ) ∘ by ~5. 1 kT, respectively, consistent with ATP acting as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state ( Chaves and Gby,2015 )

    Title: Pre-transition effects mediate forces of assembly between transmembrane proteins
    Abstract: We present a mechanism for a generic, powerful force of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force is a pre-transition ( or pre-melting ) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulation, we show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order–disorder interface. The stiffness of that interface is finite. When two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy. Analogous to the hydrophobic effect, we refer to this phenomenon as the 'orderphobic effect'. The effect is mediated by proximity to the order–disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 1998 ). As in the hydrophobic effect ( Chandler, 2005 ), the strength and range of the orderphobic force leverages the power of a phase transition, depending in this case on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability depends upon the proximity to the membrane’s phase transition, and, for the simple protein models considered in this paper, it depends upon the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane

. For instance, at zero lateral pressure and 294 K in the model DPPC membrane, we find that the average thicknesses of the hydrophobic layers in the ordered and disordered states are 𝒟o=3. 1 nm and 𝒟d=2. 6 nm, respectively. A transmembrane protein with hydrophobic thickness of size ℓ≈2. 6 nm will therefore favor the structure of the disordered phase. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order–disorder interface

. Further information on this phenomenon is provided in Appendix. Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques ( Eggeling et al., 2009 ). Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are far more complicated than the models considered in this paper. Part of the complexity is associated with multiple components, which allow for more than one order–disorder transition

., 2011; Domański et al., 1818 ). Further, there is a dual to the orderphobic effect: a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order–disorder interface. For example, one of our model proteins with a positive mismatch ( ℓ=𝒟o ) would induce order in its vicinity. This effect is illustrated in the Appendix. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly

. A consequence of the regular tail packing is that hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase, 𝒟o is larger than that of the disordered phase, 𝒟d. Correspondingly, the area per lipid in the ordered phase is smaller than that in the disordered phase. 10. 7554/eLife. 13150. 003Figure 1. First-order phase transition in a model lipid bilayer. ( A ) Order–disorder phase diagram in the tension–temperature, λ−T, plane. The lateral pressure across the membrane is −λ

. Further, an obvious consequence of the orderphobic effect is the existence of a driving force that will move orderphobic proteins from an ordered phase to a disordered phase, and the creation of large disordered domains as a result of clustering orderphobic proteins. Both of these effects have been noted in simulations of disordering α-helix proteins in a membrane exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid disordered domains ( Schäfer et al., 2011; Domański et al., 1818 )

. Hydrophobic mismatch is but one possibility. β-sheets that align neighboring lipids are others. The fact that the orderphilic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases implies it should occur in disordered membranes that are thermodynamically close to coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. The orderphobic effect may also be of direct relevance in understanding the behavior of lung-surfactant monolayers

. Therefore, the model proteins with zero mismatch do not induce a disordered region, and the orderphobic effect vanishes. See Figure 5B and D. Figure 4 also shows that the orderphobic effect produces excess mobility, by proteins melting order in a surrounding microscopic layer and by facilitating the motions of neighboring proteins. This finding explains how protein mobility and reorganization can be relatively facile in the so-called 'gel' phases of membranes

., 1998 ). The results of this paper are also applicable to lipid monolayers and could govern the diffusion and assembly of proteins embedded within the relatively rigid ordered phases. Finally, we speculate that the orderphobic effect plays important roles in membrane fusion, budding, and cell signaling ( Fratti et al., 2004; Zick et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2001; James and Vale, 2012; Różycki et al., 2012 )

We choose the MARTINI model of hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) lipid bilayers ( Marrink et al., 2007 ) to illustrate the orderphobic effect. See Materials and methods. This membrane model exhibits an ordered phase and a disordered phase. Figure 1A contrasts configurations from the two phases, and it shows our estimated phase boundary between the two phases. The ordered phase has regular tail packing compared to the disorganized tail arrangement of the disordered phase

. ( B ) Cross section of the lipid bilayer in the ordered phase containing a model protein of radius 2. 7 nm with a hydrophobic thickness ℓ=2. 3 nm ≤𝒟d. ( C ) The radial variation of the order parameters ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩ ( right axis ) and ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩/⟨ρ ( r ) ⟩ ( left axis ) show disorder in the vicinity of the protein of radius 1. 9 nm

. A disordering ( i. e., orderphobic ) transmembrane protein is one that solvates more favorably in the disordered phase than in the ordered phase. The disordering effect of the protein could be produced by specific side chain structures. See Appendix. Here, in the main text, we consider a simpler mechanism

. To the extent that lipid packing is disrupted, even small α-helix proteins can be orderphobic. Evidence for this assessment is provided in Appendix. Thus, the orderphobic effect can lead to clustering of transmembrane α-helices. Moreover, just as the strength and range of the orderphobic effect can be modified by changing the radius and mismatch of our model proteins, the strength and range of the orderphobic effect will also be affected by the structure of protein side chains

. This case corresponds to the situation of lipid rafts ( Simons and Ikonen, 1997 ), which consists of ordered domains floating in otherwise disordered membranes. The stable interface separating domains then serves as a concrete geometrical definition of the raft. This orderphilic effect will depend upon the extent to which the surface of the transmembrane protein is commensurate with the ordered phase structure. Hydrophobic mismatch is but one possibility

. The spatial extent of the disordered region increases with proximity to phase coexistence as shown in Figure 5A. 10. 7554/eLife. 13150. 009Figure 5. Strength of the orderphobic force. ( A ) Radial variation of the order parameter showing the extent of the disordered region as a function of temperature, for a protein of radius 1. 9 nm and hydrophobic thickness 2. 3 nm. The extent of the disordered region increases as the melting temperature is approached, at zero surface tension

. Modeling might build from recent numerical work on the liquid-ordered phase ( Risselada and Marrink, 2008 ). Bear in mind that the strength and range of the orderphobic effect depends upon the proximity of the order–disorder transition. This proximity can be changed by changing temperature, as illustrated in Figure 5A. With many components in play, the proximity can also be changed by varying membrane composition

. Irrespective of that angle dependence, the stability of the interface and the quantitative consistency with capillary scaling provide our evidence for the order–disorder transition being a first-order transition in the model we have simulated. The system sizes we have considered contain up to 107 particles, allowing for membranes with N ≈ 104 lipids, and requiring 10 μs to equilibrate

. 2 nm, is sufficient to induce an order–disorder interface with fluctuations consistent with capillary theory. Figure 4 shows three snapshots from a typical trajectory initiated with two proteins of radius 1.9 nm and hydroobic thickness 2.3nm. The proteins are separated by a distance of 1.5. The order–dis interface is stabilized by the orderobic effect, which reduces the interfacial free energy between the ordered and dis phases. The orderobic effect is stronger than that arising from membrane elasticity, as shown in Figure 3. The orderobic effect is also stronger than the hydrophobic effect, as shown in Figure 2. The orderobic effect arises from the proximity to the order–order transition and the hydroph mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered

The orderobic effect is analogous to the hydrophobic effect ( Chandler,200 ) in that the strength and range of the orderobic lever the power of the phase transition, in this case the ability of the orderobic protein to induce disordered in its vicinity. This depends on the proximity to the membrane’s phase, and for the simple models in this paper it depends the protein’s radius and hydroobic mismatch the membrane. For example, at lateral pressure and 294K in the DPC membrane we find the thickness of theobic layers in ordered and disordered are 3.1nm and 2.6nm respectively. A transmembrane withobic of 2.6 will favor the disordered. If is large enough it can melt the ordered near and form an order–dis interface. Further on this phenomenon is in Appendix Our prediction of lipid surroundingobic proteins may be tested by single molecule techniques ( Eggeling et al,2009.

    Title: Relationship between simultaneously recorded spiking activity and fluorescence signal in GCaMP6 transgenic mice
    Abstract: Fluorescent calcium indicators are often used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials ( APs ) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope’s field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron, and compromising AP detection. Here, we characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected ( often <10% and ~20–30%, respectively ), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.

   ., 2016; Berens et al., 2018 ). Inferring the underlying AP train or firing rate from calcium imaging remains challenging for several reasons. First, population imaging studies necessarily employ a large field of view containing many neurons. In contrast, the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function is typically characterized with a soma filling the field of view of the microscope, to maximize photon flux from the soma and thereby signal-to-noise ratio

. To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, we first identified all isolated AP events. For GCaMP6s, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥1000 and ≥500 ms, respectively. For GCaMP6f, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥300 ms. One result of finding isolated events is that only a minority of APs were used to construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves. Within each event, APs were summed over 250 ms

., 2013; Theis et al., 2016; Dana et al., 2016 ), our work facilitates interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset ( http://observatory. brain-map. org/visualcoding ) ( de Vries et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have established that most APs can be detected with GCaMP6 indicators under near-optimal conditions ( Chen et al., 2013 )

. We then tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal conditions ( models refined using the spiking information, with the soma filling the field of view ) and under the less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments. Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.

Genetically encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs ) are widely used with two-photon laser scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo ( Luo et al., 2018 ). This optical approach is minimally invasive and enables simultaneous measurement of activity from hundreds or even thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution, over multiple sessions

. In a recent challenge, ~40 algorithms were trained and tested on datasets consisting of 37 GCaMP6-expressing neurons, underscoring the need for additional GCaMP6 calibration data ( Berens et al., 2018 ). In addition to supporting efforts toward spike inference, an improved understanding of the relationship between spiking and observed fluorescence signals is necessary to further broaden the utility and impact of calcium imaging

. Using a contemporary GECI such as GCaMP6s, fluorescence changes associated with isolated spikes ( action potentials, APs ) in vivo can be detected when imaged at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution ( Chen et al., 2013 ) ( http://dx. doi. org/10. 6080/K02R3PMN ). Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al., 2016; Berens et al., 2018 )

. Second, there is no ground truth spiking information available for most neurons in a population. Spiking information, often from a cell-attached recording, can be used to refine the spike inference model and thereby optimize AP detection. Third, the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function may be different for each neuron due to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as neuron-to-neuron differences in indicator expression

. In summary, in this study we present a ground truth dataset from anesthetized mice with simultaneous electrophysiology and calcium imaging. Analysis of this dataset revealed that only a small fraction of isolated APs were detected under typical population imaging conditions and with existing spike inference algorithms

. Our results indicate that even though GCaMP6 indicators are bright and sensitive enough to enable the detection of most 1 AP events in superficial cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo if the detection procedure is optimized using ground truth AP information, most events containing 1, 2, and sometimes greater numbers of APs go undetected in our ( and likely in many other ) imaging experiments with GCaMP6.

. By making our data freely available, we hope that it will serve the community as a further resource to better understand the quantitative link between calcium-evoked fluorescent imaging signals and spiking activity.

Calcium imaging is widely used to report neuronal spiking activity in vivo. However, accurate spike inference from calcium imaging remains a challenge, and there are relatively few ground truth datasets with simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiology to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms

. Likely the variability results primarily from trial-to-trial differences in the AP-evoked calcium concentration, assuming GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s are expressed at sufficient concentrations to report resting changes in calcium concentration in all four mouse lines. GCaMP6 indicators have been widely adopted because they exhibit greater AP-evoked ΔF/F than previous GCaMP indicators, but still some APs may go undetected ( Chen et al., 2013 )

Two-photon-targeted electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging were conducted in 2- to 5-month-old male and female transgenic mice: five Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 ( Emx1-s ) mice, one Camk2a-tTA;tetO-GCaMP6s ( tetO-s ) mouse, three Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Emx1-f ) mice, and four Cux2-CreERT2;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Cux2-f ) mice. All four lines drive GCaMP expression primarily in excitatory neurons

. To these ends, we contribute a ground truth dataset consisting of 48 V1 L2/3 excitatory neurons recorded at single-cell resolution ( available at https://portal. brain-map. org/explore/circuits/oephys ) and characterized their AP-to-calcium fluorescence transfer function. Complementing existing datasets with viral GECI expression ( Chen et al., 2013; Theis et al., 2016; Dana et al

. For calcium imaging, in-plane motion artifacts were corrected ( Dombeck et al., 2007 ), and neuron/ROI selection was performed using a semi-automatic algorithm ( Chen et al., 2013 ) ( kindly provided by Karel Svoboda, Janelia Research Campus ). Ring-shaped ROIs were used to select GCaMP6-positive excitatory neurons, with GCaMP6 expression typically excluded from the nucleus and restricted to the cytoplasm

. For GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f, peak ΔF/F was calculated by first finding tmax, the time of the maximum ΔF/F ≤ 500 ms and 300 ms after the first AP, respectively. Peak ΔF/F was the mean ΔF/F from tmax - 50 ms to tmax + 50 ms. Bursts of >5 APs were excluded from analysis due to the low frequency of such events. Mean and variance of the fluorescence, calculated pixelwise for each image, were linearly related, consistent with shot noise-limited imaging

. Importantly, we downsampled images to simulate population imaging conditions, enabling comparison for the same APs under different imaging conditions. Our results indicate that, in GCaMP6 transgenic mice, most APs can be detected under near-optimal conditions, while detection is less effective during population imaging. These conclusions are similar to those of previous studies with viral GCaMP6 expression, but our results also reveal two reasons for the difference in detection

., 2015; Daigle et al., 2018 ). Using our intersectional transgenic mouse lines that enable Cre recombinase-dependent expression of GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f, we simultaneously characterized the spiking activity and fluorescence of individual GECI-expressing pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex ( V1 )

. As expected, peak ΔF/F increased approximately linearly with 1–5 APs, and peak ΔF/F and decay time constant were greater with GCaMP6s than GCaMP6f ( Figure 3C ). Peak Δ/F and time constant were also greater with GCa6 than GC6f ( Figure 3D ), consistent with previous studies ( Chen et al.,2013; Theis et al,2016 ). However, we found that only a minority of AP were used to construct AP-calc fluorescence curves ( Figure 4A ), and most APs were undetected under typical population imaging conditions ( Figure 5 ). This is consistent with previous studies ( Theis et al,2016; Berens et,2018 ) and underscores the need for ground truth data to improve spike inference algorithms

Our results indicate that the AP-calc transfer function may differ between neurons due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as differences in indicator expression and neuron-to-neuron ( Figure 6 ). This is consistent with previous studies ( Theis et al,2016; Daig et,2018 ) and highlights the need for neuron-specific calibration of AP-calc transfer function. We provide a ground truth dataset with simultaneous electrophiology and imaging to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms and improve the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies

Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets, such as the Allen’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset ( http://observatory. brain.org/coding ). We hope that our data will serve as a resource for the community to better understand the quantitative link between calcium-evoked fluorescent signals and spiking activity

In summary, we characterized the AP-calc transfer function in vivo for layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex with simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCMPs or GCMPf. Our results indicate that most APs can be detected under optimal conditions, but only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events are detected under typical population imaging conditions, emphasizing the limits of detection under realistic conditions. We provide a ground truth dataset to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms and improve the interpretation of existing and future imaging studies using GECs, such as the Allen’s Brain Observatory Visual dataset.

    Title: A biological switching valve evolved in the female of a sex-role reversed cave insect to receive multiple seminal packages
    Abstract: We report a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. It is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that Neotrogla can continue mating while the first slot is occupied. In conjunction with the female penis, this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.

   . The male-holding organ ( spiny female penis ) and female-induced long copulation durations of 40 – 70 hr ( compared to just ~50 min for formation of one seminal capsule in close relatives ) in Neotrogla ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ) thus can be considered as exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats ( Lienhard and Ferreira, 2013; Lienhard and Ferreira, 2015; Yoshizawa et al., 2014 )

The present analyses show that females of Neotrogla use a special mechanism to actively control the direction of seminal flow ( Figures 1E and 2A–D ). This biological switching valve allows females to receive two seminal packages ( i. e., more nutrition ) from the same or different males within a short time span. In particular, the switching valve allows to receive a second seminal capsule while the first one is consumed

. With the switching valve, the female Neotrogla ( and possibly Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla ) can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, with leaving the other slot empty. This enables the females to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot

. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males ( sex-role reversal ) to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered as the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 )

. In a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure ( Lepinotus patruelis, Trogiidae ), the seminal transfer for forming a similarly voluminous seminal capsule is known to complete in 50 min ( Wearing-Wilde, 1995 ). The female penis of Neotrogla bears a lot of spines, by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation. Therefore, females are obviously responsible for this very long copulation, probably to obtain more semen from a male ( Yoshizawa et al

Three species of Neotrogla were examined. We detected little interspecific variation in the basic mechanism of the spermathecal plate. A virgin female of Neotrogla brasiliensis ( Caboclo Cave, Januária, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 12. iii. 2016: Figures 1DF and 2A–C: voucher ID S8KY03 ) and a copulating pair of N. truncata ( Toca dos Ossos Cave, Ourolândia, Bahia, Brazil, 14. i

. This genus is of special evolutionary and morphological interest because of the reversal in its genital structures ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). The females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ ( gynosome: Figure 1A ), which is inserted to a male vagina-like genital cavity for copulation. During mating, the male injects liquid semen into the female’s sperm storage organ ( spermatheca ) through the opening of the spermathcal duct at the tip of the female penis

., 2012; Schäfer et al., 2013 ). In addition, in the case of Neotrogla and related barklice ( Lepinotus patruelis ), the content of the seminal capsule is digested quite rapidly if not used for fertilization ( Wearing-Wilde, 1995; Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits ( i. e., for obtaining more nutrients ) rather than for genetic benefits ( i. e

. Although several examples of sex-role reversed animals induced by seminal gifting have been reported, Neotrogla so far is the only example with a morphological reversal of its intromittent organs ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa, 2017 ). This morphological reversal seems to require further upstream modifications of the genital system, such as the formation of the spermathecal plate, which was reported as an additional novelty tightly associated with the seminal gifting ( Lienhard et al

The spermatheca of Neotrogla is in principle composed of an extensible pouch for storage of the seminal capsule, a spermathecal plate divided into two interconnected sclerites ( body sclerites 1 and 2: Sc1 and 2 hereafter ), and the spermathecal duct, which discharges into the spermathecal plate ( Figure 1CD, Video 1 ). The terminology used for the following description is summarized in Table 1. The switching valve mechanism is located at the spermathecal plate

., 1893 ). This strongly suggests that the evolution of the spermathecal plate, possibly including a switching valve, preceded the evolution of the female penis. The spermathcal plate has two slots available for insemination ( Figure 1E )

. Therefore, it is very likely that, in addition to the sex-role reversal, there is at least one other key factor that enabled the evolution of a female penis. Although females of all three known genera of Sensitibillini possess a spermathecal plate, females of Sensitibilla do not have a penis-like organ ( Lienhard, 1893; Lienhard et al., 1893 )

., 2014 ). Among all animals with known sex-role reversal, Neotrogla is the only example in which a female penis evolved ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa, 2017 ). In a close relative of Neotrogla, the barklouse species Lepinotus patruelis ( Wearing-Wilde, 1996 ), the sex-roles are also reversed, but the species possesses normal genital structures

., 2014 ). After consumption of the semen, the empty capsule is detached from the plate, which is kept within the spermatheca. Because females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch ( in an extreme case, up to nine empty capsules and two filled ones attached to the plate were observed: Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ), female Neotrogla can be considered polyandrous, which is apparently controlled actively by the female

., 1893; Yoshizawa et al., 2014] ). The semen within the capsule is used not only for fertilization but is also consumed by the female as nutrition. To compete for nutritious semen, the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla ( sex-role reversal: Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Each seminal capsule is voluminous ( ~0. 05 mm3, corresponding to ~300 ml scaled up to humans ), and the duration of the copulation is very long ( for 40 to 70 hr )

., 1893; Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). However, the detailed morphology and function of this spermathecal plate, which presumably plays an important role in the evolution of the female penis, remained unclear due to the extremely small size of the involved subcomponents and their fragile spatial composition

. In contrast, the observed biological switching valve involves a passive movement component. The seminal flow injected by a male is redirected by a differential inclination of the CE ( Figure 2E ). This inclination is due to the fan-like geometry of the actuator muscle whose parts can pull the CE in the preferred direction to work against the passive closing forces generated by the resilin patches around the valve complex

. In Neotrogla and the related species ( Lepinotus ), content of the capsule is digested as nutrition during the seminal capsule being attached to the spermathecal plate ( the transparent capsule shown in Figure 1B is a digested and empty one: Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Therefore, if there is only one slot for insemination, as in the spermatheca of Lepinotus, females cannot receive another capsule while digesting one

. Therefore, the origin of this switching valve dates to at least the break-up of the two continents, over 100 million years ago, when the genus Neotla diverged from its relatives ( Lien and Ferreira,2015 ). The spermathe of Neotla has two slots for insemination ( Figure 1E ), which allows the female to receive a second seminal package while the first is consumed. The sperhe of Neotla is composed of two sclerites, a closure element and in-and outflow canals. Females have a penis-like introment organ to coercively males and obtain voluminous semen. The is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal. is not only used for fertilization but consumed by female as nutrition.

    Title: Munc18-1-regulated stage-wise SNARE assembly underlying synaptic exocytosis
    Abstract: Synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) proteins couple their stage-wise folding/assembly to rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters in a Munc18-1-dependent manner. The functions of the different assembly stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains ( or NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively ). We found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly. Comparison of their effects on SNARE assembly and on exocytosis reveals that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, whereas MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain ( NRD ) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1.

. In the absence of Munc18-1, no SNARE reassembly was observed ( Figure 1C and 9B ) due to dissociation of the SNAP-25 molecule ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). In contrast, in the presence of 10 µM Munc18-1, 45% of 113 completely unfolded SNARE complexes showed full reassembly ( Figure 9A, B ). This observation suggests that Munc18-1 held the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as t-SNARE unfolded, facilitating de novo SNARE assembly

., 2012 ). We observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with the previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex ( Sudhof and Rothman, 2009; Sudhof, 2014 ). The most distinct Munc18-1 activity is to enhance de novo SNARE assembly. To observe this activity, we completely unfolded the SNARE complex and then relaxed the complex to a low force to detect its possible reassembly ( Figure 9A )

., 2009 ) or alter the interactions between SNAREs and membranes to facilitate fusion ( Ngatchou et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2013; Honigmann et al., 2013 ). We found that Munc18-1 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly. Combining with previous results, we propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion ( Figure 14 )

., 2007; Shen et al., 2015 ). In particular, SNARE mutations that compromise interactions between the fully assembled SNARE complexes and their cognate SM proteins can support membrane fusion ( Peng and Gallwitz, 2004 ). Taking together, we conclude that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly. 10. 7554/eLife. 09580. 032Figure 14. Working model of Munc18-1-regulated stage-wise SNARE assembly in membrane fusion

. Because the structures of all SNARE complexes and SM proteins are highly conserved, they predicted that SM proteins serve as a template to initiate SNARE assembly into a partially zippered complex. Our discoveries of Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly and half-zippered SNARE complex strongly support this prediction, which in turn offers a molecular mechanism for our observations ( state iii )

., 2012; Zorman et al., 2014 ). In addition, the NTD energies of the mutants relative to that of the WT barely change with the crosslinking site. Combining our findings with previous results on exocytosis, we confirmed distinct functions of different SNARE assembly stages in synaptic exocytosis. We showed that tight thermodynamic coupling requires specific SNARE assembly intermediates and pathways

. Because this activity is NRD-independent, Munc18-1 likely directly binds SNARE motifs to promote SNARE assembly ( states ii and iii ) ( Shi et al., 2011 ). Third, Munc18-1 stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex in an NRD-dependent manner ( state v ). This activity is strongly force-dependent and disappears at a force below ~15 pN. Fourth, we found that Munc18-1 associates with the t-SNARE complex ( Zhang et al., 2015; Pertsinidis et al

. Consistent with this observation, we considered that after trans-SNARE assembly, Munc18-1 switches to the NRD-independent Tc binding mode observed by us. Munc18-1 then induces Tc folding and greatly stabilizes the t-SNARE to facilitate SNARE assembly and membrane fusion similar to Vc and Vn peptides ( Melia et al., 2002; Pobbati et al., 2006; Li et al., 2014 )

. In addition, we previously showed that representative SNARE complexes mediating diverse membrane trafficking pathways slowly initiate their NTD assembly and pause in half-zippered states. These observations make SM-mediated SNARE assembly necessary. Our findings also corroborates that Munc18-1 enhances assembly of trans-SNARE complexes, thereby promoting liposome-liposome fusion ( Rathore et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2015 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09580. 008 The molecular mechanism by which Munc18-1 regulates SNARE assembly, although essential for membrane fusion, has long been a matter of debate ( Rizo and Sudhof, 2012 ). On one hand, Munc18-1 can significantly enhance the rate and specificity of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion under certain conditions ( Shen et al., 2007; Rathore et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2015 )

., 1998 ) ( Figure 1B ). To observe reversible and regulatory SNARE assembly, we designed SNARE complexes containing the full cytoplasmic domain and an N-terminal crosslinking site between syntaxin and VAMP2. We examined six such SNARE constructs crosslinked at different sites ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2 ) and found that the construct crosslinked near the -6 hydrophobic layer exhibited fast and reversible NTD folding/unfolding transition ( Figure 1A, B, C )

., 2014 ). As a result, SNARE-mediated fusion in the absence of Munc18-1 is remarkably insensitive to CTD folding energies ( Zorman et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2007 ). We hypothesize that Munc18-1 helps to form a super-complex containing Munc18-1, trans-SNARE complexes, and other regulatory proteins with approximately fixed stoichiometry to efficiently and specifically drive membrane fusion

., 2010; Shen et al., 2014; Sudhof, 2014 ). Thus, it is crucial to understand how SNARE assembly dictates stage-wise exocytosis and how SNARE mutations alter the energetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly to cause their observed phenotypes. 10. 7554/eLife. 09580. 003Figure 1. Four distinct stages of SNARE assembly. ( A ) Sequences and domain structures of SNARE motifs in VAMP2, syntaxin 1A ( SX1 ), and SNAP-25B ( SN1 and SN2 )

. Our findings contrast with previous reports that Munc18-1 reduces the rate of SNARE assembly in an NRD-dependent manner, probably due to different experimental conditions ( Burkhardt et al., 2008 ). We noticed that Munc18-1 and other SM proteins significantly enhance membrane fusion only under special conditions

. 8, suggesting a strong correlation between the different reassembly events mediated by Munc18-1. An appealing interpretation for the correlation is that the same Munc18-1 molecule mediated the consecutive reassembly events without dissociation from the SNARE complex during its multiple rounds of disassembly and reassembly. The Munc18-1-mediated SNARE assembly was not abolished by the two VAMP2 layer mutations L60A and L63A ( Figure 9B )

, suggesting that M18-1 interacts with the SN motifs of VAMP2 and syntaxin. In contrast, M18-1 did not interact with the SN motifs of SNAP-25 ( Figure 1— supplement 4 ). This is consistent with previous reports that M18-1 binds the SN motifs of VAMP and syntax but not SNAP-25 ( Sudhof and Rothman,2009; Sud,2014 ).

    Title: Symmetric exchange of multi-protein building blocks between stationary focal adhesions and the cytosol
    Abstract: How can the integrin adhesome get self-assembled locally, rapidly, and correctly as diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites? Here, we investigate this question by exploring the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy ( FCCS ) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) we found that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, thereby keeping the cytosolic pool of building blocks spatiotemporally uniform. We conclude a model in which multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites and symmetric exchange of these building blocks preserves their specifications and thus the assembly logic of the system.

   . Strikingly, we found that the integrin adhesome is actually extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that can facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The physical associations between adhesion site components are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating that these sites exchange their building blocks with the cytosol without altering them ( i. e., symmetrically )

. In the cytosol, the building blocks cannot form bigger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions. We propose that at the plasma membrane the system can get locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome ( Figure 4 )

We conclude that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, thereby forming multi-protein building blocks for cell-matrix adhesion sites. Our results further indicate that these building blocks are size-confined ( Figure 1 ) and are predominantly corresponding to the functional layers across focal adhesions of anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation ( Figures 2 and 4 )

. Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol satisfies this requirement by ensuring that building blocks will enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered. 10. 7554/eLife. 02257. 009Figure 4. A model of switchable formation of adhesion sites via pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks. The integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites

. Otherwise, the self-assembly process would lose control on the identity of the co-recruited proteins when recruiting a protein embedded in a multi-protein building block and thereby will be drifted to form aberrant structures. In order to understand such assembly logic of adhesion sites, it would be important to integrate interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome ( Köster et al

We first asked whether the integrin adhesome forms in the cytosol pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. To address this question we selected 13 key components of adhesion sites—α-actinin, α-parvin, p130CAS ( CAS ), CSK, FAK, ILK, paxillin, PINCH, talin, tensin, VASP, vinculin, and zyxin—and quantified systematically all 91 possible pairwise physical associations between them in the cytosol of REF52 cells using FCCS ( Figure 1 )

. Therefore, we conclude that the cytosolic building blocks of adhesion sites are combinatorially diversified and that most proteins can be recruited to these sites as part of different types of building blocks. 10. 7554/eLife. 02257. 005Figure 2. The cytosolic building blocks of cell-matrix adhesion sites are combinatorially diversified. ( A ) Not all cytosolic integrin-adhesome complexes are necessarily building blocks for adhesion sites

., 2011; Lavelin et al., 2013 ). Considering the molecular diversity and complexity of cell-matrix adhesion sites ( Zamir et al., 1999; Zamir and Geiger, 2001; Cukierman et al., 2002; Zamir et al., 2008 ), a major question is how can the integrin adhesome form these structures rapidly, locally, and correctly

The integrin adhesome contains more than hundred proteins with multiple binding sites for each other ( Zamir and Geiger, 2001; Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007; Byron et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2011; Schiller et al., 2011; Geiger and Zaidel-Bar, 2012 ). Upon local signals, components of the integrin adhesome get self-assembled along the plasma membrane to form nascent adhesion sites and to further mature them to focal complexes and focal adhesions ( Zamir and Geiger, 2001; Cukierman et al

. To assess the diversity of integrin adhesome protein complexes that indeed serve as building blocks for adhesion sites, we asked whether each analyzed protein is a component of only one type of building block ( Figure 2A ). In such a case, each two physically associated proteins should exhibit similar dwell time and mobile fraction in adhesion sites, since they are part of only one, same, type of building block ( Figure 2A )

. e., symmetrically ). Together, our results lead to a concept in which self-assembly of adhesion sites involves recruitment of multi-protein modules and symmetric exchange preserves the specifications of these building blocks in the cytosolic pool, thereby facilitating correct self-assembly.

. In order to approach this question it is essential to consider and examine not only the adhesion sites themselves but also the state of their components in the cytosolic pool. However, the study of this fundamental aspect was largely abandoned so far, due to tacitly conceiving the cytosolic pool as a passive supply of individual integrin adhesome proteins. In this work we challenged this view by systematic FCCS and FRAP measurements

. However, FAK, paxillin, and CAS exhibit higher α values, suggesting FRET due to direct interaction. Scale bars, 10 μm. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02257. 008 In order to experimentally discriminate between symmetric and asymmetric exchanges of protein complexes, we measured the physical associations between integrin adhesome components at spots near ( <1. 5 μm ) and far from focal adhesions ( Figure 3 )

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02257. 004 A network of proteins that have multivalent interactions with each other has the potential to form large, high-order, complexes. Therefore we sought to assess the size of protein complexes formed by the integrin adhesome in the cytosol. If a given high-order protein complex exists, then each pair of its components is expected to exhibit a pairwise physical association

. On the plasma membrane, the system can get locally switched on to assemble an adhesion site by passing through checkpoints that enable additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome. These checkpoints include anchoring of integrins to the extracellular matrix, mechanical stretching of proteins like talin and CAS by actomyosin contractility, and activation of proteins like vinculin and talin by PIP2 on the plasma membrane

. Asymmetric material exchange by disassembling focal adhesions can enable their rapid destruction by breaking them up to relatively bigger pieces, as well as be a mechanism by which they can affect other adhesion sites. The results presented here revise the concept about adhesion sites self-assembly, from a process that is mediated by the recruitment of individual proteins to a process involving pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks

., 1996 ). Similarly, our results suggest mutual exclusiveness between the associations of VASP with zyxin, α-actinin, and vinculin and between the associations of zyxin with VASP and CAS ( Figure 1G ). We postulate that the size-confinement of cytosolic complexes reflects a system-level design of interdependencies between protein interactions throughout the integrin adhesome network to prevent stochastic assembly of aberrant large complexes

. This has implications for broad aspects of cell-matrix adhesion sites formation and regulation. Multi-protein building blocks, in comparison to single-protein building blocks, reduce the number of steps required for self-assembly of adhesion sites. With a properly designed regulation, such a reduction of steps can make the self-assembly of adhesion sites less sensitive to stochastic biochemical noise and therefore also faster

., 2002; Gardel et al., 2010; Zaidel-Bar and Geiger, 2010 ). These adhesion sites assemble, disassemble, and change their molecular content by exchanging their components with the surrounding cytosol ( Wolfenson et al., 2011; Lavelin et al., 2013 ). Likewise, stationary adhesion sites are dynamically maintained by a balanced rapid exchange of constituents with the cytosol ( Lele et al.,2013 ). The cytosolic pool of integrin adesome is not a passive reservoir of individual proteins but a pool of pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites

We conclude that the integrin adesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cyol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Our results indicate that these building blocks are size-confined and predominantly correspond to functional layers of focal adhesion anchoring integrin, force transduction, and actin regulation. Symmetric exchange between adhesion sites and cyol satisfies this requirement by ensuring that blocks enter and exit adhesion without being altered.

    Title: An electrophysiological marker of arousal level in humans
    Abstract: Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) and general anesthesia with propofol are prominent states of reduced arousal linked to the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram ( EEG ). Although rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, ‘wake-like’ EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.

   ., 2017 ), could track arousal states in humans both under anesthesia with propofol and during sleep in intracranial and scalp EEG recordings. Specifically, we hypothesized that the spectral slope should become more negative ( i. e. the power spectrum steeper ) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. Importantly, we also predicted that the spectral slope could discriminate wakefulness from NREM as well as REM sleep

., 2010 ). Having established that the spectral slope differs significantly between wakefulness and propofol anesthesia, we next examined if this state-dependent modulation generalized to other forms of decreased arousal, such as sleep. We specifically sought to determine if the spectral slope could discern wakefulness from different sleep stages. We analyzed two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep

., 1998; Shen et al., 2003 ). Here, we demonstrate that this frequency range is well suited to track arousal in both anesthesia and different sleep levels including REM and NREM sleep. Third, the spectral slope mirrored the rapid changes in excitability observed over the course of a slow wave directly tracking cortical ‘up- ‘and ‘down-states’, hence, providing a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations

., 2007 ). Here, we demonstrate that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory components and can be approximated by the 1/f decay of the power spectrum estimated from the 30 to 45 Hz frequency range, reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep and general anesthesia with propofol. 1/f dynamics are observed across a variety of tasks ( He et al

. Collectively, our results from four independent studies provide five main advances: First, the spectral slope tracks changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-second epochs to full night recordings. Second, our results provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal

. The arousal level is low during anesthesia and in all sleep states including REM. Both NREM sleep stage 3 ( also called slow-wave sleep ) and general anesthesia with propofol exhibit similar electrophysiological features, such as an increase in low frequency activity and the occurrence of prominent slow oscillations ( <1. 25 Hz; Brown et al., 2010; Franks and Zecharia, 2011; Murphy et al., 2011; Prerau et al., 2017; Purdon et al., 2013 )

. 5 Hz ). ( 3 ) The power spectrum of each state was averaged over all samples of the state ( wake and anesthesia or rest, wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 3 ( N3 ) and rapid eye movement sleep ( REM ) ), channels and subjects ( Figure 1b, c and Figure 2b, c ). For better comparison, we visualized the effect at the scalp level. For Study 2 simultaneous EEG recordings were not available

. In Study 1 ( n = 9 ), we found that the time-resolved spectral slope closely tracked changes in arousal levels while subjects underwent propofol anesthesia ( Figure 1a ). Specifically, we observed a significant decrease of the spectral slope from wakefulness ( −1. 84 ± 0. 30; mean ± SEM ) to anesthesia ( −3. 10 ± 0. 20 ) when averaged across all electrodes ( Figure 1b; permutation t-test: p<0. 0001, obs. t8 = 7. 09, dWake-Anesthesia = 1. 65 )

. Our results indicate that the spectral slope differentiates between wakefulness and general anesthesia in humans. This effect spanned all scalp and the majority of intracranial electrodes, hence, supporting the notion that propofol anesthesia induces a global, brain-wide state change ( Brown et al., 2010 )

. N3 sleep and propofol anesthesia are both characterized by the occurrence of prominent slow oscillations ( Murphy et al., 2011 ). Previous reports indicated that low frequency activity might serve as a marker to disentangle different arousal states ( Brown et al., 2010; Franks and Zecharia, 2011; Murphy et al., 2011 ). Our results confirm and extend this observation. However, while slow wave activity ( <1

We first tested if the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness and propofol anesthesia in humans in two experiments. In the first study, we recorded scalp EEG during general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery in otherwise healthy adults ( Study 1, n = 9 )

A recent EEG study under anesthesia with propofol, xenon and ketamine found that the PCI correlated with the spectral exponent derived from the 1 to 40 Hz frequency range ( Colombo et al., 2019 ). A related study reported that the spectral slope derived from the 0

., 2017 ). Moreover, it has been reported that that the spectral slope between 1 and 40 Hz in human scalp EEG recordings discriminated states with conscious content, namely wakefulness and ketamine anesthesia, from states where no conscious report was possible, i. e. Xenon and propofol anesthesia ( Colombo et al., 2019 ). Collectively, these studies implied that propofol anesthesia was accompanied by a steeper decay of the power spectrum ( Colombo et al., 2019; Gao et al

., 2017; Purdon et al., 2013 ). Moreover, propofol anesthesia has been linked to the emergence of a strong frontal alpha oscillation ( 8–12 Hz; Purdon et al., 2013 ) whereas spindles ( 12–16 Hz ) typically appear in NREM sleep stage 2 ( Prerau et al., 2017 ). In contrast, REM sleep is characterized by a desynchronized, active pattern in the electroencephalogram ( EEG ), which resembles wakefulness ( Brown et al., 2010; Prerau et al., 2017 )

. Critically, we combined intracranial EEG with polysomnography ( scalp EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG ) to enable comparable sleep staging across both the scalp and intracranial studies. We observed that the time-resolved spectral slope closely tracked the technician-scored hypnogram ( Figure 2a ). To quantify this effect, we compared spectral slope estimates across wakefulness, N3 and REM sleep

This finding indicates that the spectral slope constitutes a marker that successfully discriminates REM sleep from wakefulness solely from the electrophysiological brain state. Note that classification performance is bound by the accuracy of the underlying sleep scoring as a ground truth

Taken together, the results from the GLM mirrored the findings from the LDA approach: The spectral slope enabled an improved classification and contained more unique information about arousal state compared to slow wave power when differentiating wakefulness from both NREM and REM sleep

    Title: Stromule extension along microtubules coordinated with actin-mediated anchoring guides perinuclear chloroplast movement during innate immunity
    Abstract: Dynamic tubular extensions from chloroplasts called stromules have recently been shown to connect with nuclei and function during innate immunity. We demonstrate that stromules extend along microtubules ( MTs ) and MT organization directly affects stromule dynamics since stabilization of MTs chemically or genetically increases stromule numbers and length. Although actin filaments ( AFs ) are not required for stromule extension, they provide anchor points for stromules. Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement. Stromule-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting it is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells. Our results show that MTs and AFs may facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an innate immune response. We propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity.

    Supporting Text:
   . During an innate immune response, we propose a model where stromules extend along MTs towards nuclei and attach to the nuclei at actin anchor points; and, these perinuclear stromule attachments guide chloroplasts to the nucleus.

., 2007b ). Therefore, the precise role of AFs and MTs during stromule dynamics in green tissue chloroplasts is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the mechanism of stromule extension and movement in chloroplasts of green leaf tissue and perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity. Our results show that MTs are required for stromule extension and movement. MT depolymerization led to stromule retraction, and MT stabilization increased stromule frequency

. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and stromule-directed movement and importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity.

Cytoskeletal elements in plant cells support several cellular functions, including cytoplasmic streaming, cell division, cell elongation, polar growth, vesicle trafficking, nuclear positioning and morphogenesis ( Cai et al., 2015; Higa et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015 ). In this study, we show that dynamic stromules extend along MTs and AFs stabilize stromules and chloroplast-to-nuclear connections during innate immune response

. Results described here show that MT-mediated stromule extension and AF-mediated stromule anchoring are two complementary activities during stromule formation and movement. We provide mechanistic insights into how interactions with the cytoskeleton form and stabilize stromules. Furthermore, we describe a new type of organellar movement along MTs that is stromule-directed and reveal a mechanism for perinuclear clustering during innate immunity

. Stromules have the ability to direct chloroplast movement, and AF anchoring of stromules may guide perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity. Previous studies in non-green hypocotyls indicated a role for AFs and MTs during stromule formation ( Kwok and Hanson, 2003, 2004a )

., 2017a ). Overall, our results invoke a model in which, during effector-triggered immunity, MTs facilitate stromule extensions and stromules bind tightly to AFs around nuclei. The role of MTs during the formation of stromule-to-nuclei connections requires further studies. However, our data suggests that once those connections are formed, stromules may guide or pull chloroplasts toward the nucleus, which then results in perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts

. We verified these results with another AF marker, mTalin-Citrine ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ). We also observed that when the bodies of chloroplasts were in contact with nuclei, there were connections with AFs ( Figure 9B–C, arrows ). Since p50-induced immunity leads to vigorous stromule induction ( Caplan et al., 2015 ) ; Figure 5 ), we hypothesized that more chloroplasts might move toward nucleus by stromule-directed movement of chloroplast body

. These results support that anchoring of stromules to the AFs at the nucleus or more generally chloroplast movement is important for perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during plant immune response. In conclusion, we propose a model in which perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts involves stromule anchoring to AFs surrounding nuclei and stromules guide chloroplasts toward nuclei during an immune response.

. Interestingly, we observed a clear thinning or constriction at the site of stromule-to-actin interaction points along the length and across the body of the chloroplast ( Figure 6E; arrowheads ). Three-dimensional modeling shows grooves across the body of the chloroplast that correlate with AFs ( Figure 6E, Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–D )

. Movement along AFs was indirectly implicated by the identification of myosin XI cargo domain and a small tail domain that localize to chloroplasts ( Natesan et al., 2009; Sattarzadeh et al., 2009 ). Knockdown of myosin XIs qualitatively disrupted stromules ( Sattarzadeh et al., 2009 ) or quantitatively decreased the percent of plastids with stromules ( Natesan et al., 2009 ). However, the dynamics of stromules moving along AFs were not examined in these studies ( Natesan et al

., 2015 ). Stromules may also facilitate certain number of chloroplasts to maintain contact with the moving nuclei ( Erickson et al., 2017a ). However, the mechanism ( s ) that facilitates chloroplast stromules connections to nuclei and eventual perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts is unknown. Stromule length is variable as they extend, retract and branch, changing their shape and position ( Gray et al., 2001; Gunning, 2005; Kwok and Hanson, 2004c; Waters et al., 2004 )

., 2011 ). Our findings strongly supports a role for the cytoskeleton in which stromules require a combination of MT and AF interactions. Nonetheless, the function of the MCS between stromules and ER is intriguing and may assist in transfer of proteins, lipids or small molecules. Blue-light-induced-chloroplast movement in plants is driven by chloroplast actin filaments ( cp-actin ) ( Kadota et al., 2009 )

. This new type of stromule-directed movement is completely disrupted by AF inhibitors. However, stromule-directed chloroplast movement was still observed when AFs were partially disrupted, suggesting that chloroplast anchoring might restrict stromule directed movement. We hypothesize that a biological function of stromules is to direct the movement of chloroplasts

. Collectively, these results indicate that changes in MT organization caused by NbGCP4-silencing plants or during p50-induced immunity are correlated with changes in stromule dynamics, indicating a possible direct or indirect role for MT organization in modulating stromule dynamics. Since AFs were previously shown to regulate chloroplast movement and stromule morphology ( Kwok and Hanson, 2003; Kwok and Hanson, 2004a ), we tested if stromules extend along AFs

. Interestingly, stromules in the green algae, Acetabularia, also have been implicated in chloroplast movement ( Menzel, 1994 ), suggesting that both cp-actin and stromule-directed chloroplast movement are conserved between land plants and green algae ( Suetsugu and Wada, 2016 ). We have recently shown that stromules play an important role during innate immunity and programmed cell death ( Caplan et al., 2015 )

. Silencing the gene for γ-tubulin complex protein 4 ( GCP4 ) caused enhanced bundling and disrupted dynamics of MTs, which resulted in longer stromules, but slower extension and retraction. Although stromule extension does not require AFs, they function as anchor points that stabilize stromules and anchor the body of chloroplasts. AFs play an important role in type of chloroplast movement that appears to be directed by stromules

. MTs promote stromule extensions, contributing to more stromule movement, while AFs provide anchors to position chloroplasts towards the nucleus. These results reinforce the role for AFs as anchor points for stromules that were also previously shown to exist in Arabidopsis hypocotyls ( Kwok and Hanson, 2004b ), and a recent study showing that stromules are involved in maintaining contact with nuclei ( Erickson et al., 2017a )

. We have recently shown that stromules are induced and function during innate immunity ( Caplan et al., 2015 ). The induced stromules make connections with the nuclei to facilitate transport of chloroplast-localized defense protein NRIP1 ( N receptor interacting protein 1 ) and the pro-defense molecule, hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ), from chloroplasts into nuclei during an immune response ( Caplan et al., 2015 )

. Tracking the stromule and chloroplast movement ( Lu et al., 2017 ) showed that stromules can still direct chloroplast movement if AFs are only partially disrupted. One chloroplast ( Figure 7A–B ) and stromules ( Figure 7C–D ) were visualized in the same field of view. AFs were visualized with phalloidin ( red ) and chloroplasts with chlorophyll ( green ) and stromules with chlorophyll ( green ). AFs were observed at the periphery of the chloroplast ( Figure 7A–B arrows ) and stromules at the center ( Figure 7–C arrows ), indicating that AFs are not required for strom extension but provide anchoring points for stromules

Our results show that MTs are required for strom extension and AFs for anchoring of stromules during chloroplast movement toward the nucleus during innate response. We propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and attach to AF around the nucleus and guide chloroplasts toward the nucleus during an immune response.
Researchers have developed a method to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They used a pseudo-likelihood method to identify pairs of amino acids that covary across protein-protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal subunit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures. The results showed that these pairs are almost always in contact in the complex, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the proteins. This method was used to predict subunit contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures and models for four complexes, including the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter.

The study found that residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting pairs but rarely between non-interacting pairs, making it useful for predicting protein interactions. The method was applied to a set of 41 protein pairs with known structures, generating models within 2Å of the native structure in 38 cases and within 4Å in one case. For the 50S ribosome, the method used sequence from ~1500 non-redund genomes, suggesting that with large numbers of aligned, residue-residue interactions can be predicted with high confidence based on amino sequence covariance.

A docking protocol was developed using predicted contacts as restraints and sampled space to generate models of protein-protein complexes. The best model had an interface within 4Å of native in 14 cases and more than half native contacts in 16. Residue covariance in complexes with structures showed that pairs with high GREIN scores are almost always in contact in experimentally determined structures. The method was used to predict contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures and models for four complexes, including the tripart ATP-independent perasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyv formate lyase-activ enzyme, and methine ABC.

The results demonstrate strong selective pressure at protein-protein interfaces beyond residue conservation and co-evolving pairs are nearly in contact in protein. Not all residues across interfaces co-evolve nor protein-protein interfaces. The study focused on prokaryotes and mitochondria, but the approach is applicable to any taxa.
Researchers investigated how humans categorize visual scenes by accumulating information from multiple locations in a scene using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a categorization task. Participants' eye movements followed an active strategy that incorporated prior knowledge of the scene and statistical structure of patterns. Categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian sensor. A combination of Bayesian observer and sensor estimated that 70% of apparent optimality in fixation arose from biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The process of selecting locations was 70% efficient in the task. Results suggest participants select movements to maximize information about categories requiring integration from multiple locations.

The study extends active sensing to tasks with arbitrary features, not spatial, such as categories. It provides first fixation-by-fixation analysis under eye movements matching observer to participants' performance. The approach dissociates eye movement process from perceptual, motor, and decision processes, and identifies sources of suboptim in sensing and quantifies efficiency of each fixation throughout a scene. The task is fundamentally different from search, where a single location has necessary information, and movements are described by inhibition of return. Participants' movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies and 70% as optimal sensor with participants' bias, perception, noise, and saccadic inaccuracies.

An experiment with patterns controlled and simple ensured foveal vision dominated a gaze-conting task tracked eye and revealed small apert of image at each location. A study with object localization found choice locations close to random despite learning stimulus statistics. Another with visual search movements unaffected by stimuli configuration. The task required integration of information from multiple locations to select next movement and solve, and a closed strategy was necessary for efficiency.

Evidence suggests humans and animals direct sensors to extract task-relevant information efficiently. The pattern of movements depends on type of information sought. In contrast, participants used prior knowledge and accumulated scene to guide movements. Better performance may be due to naturalistic task involving extraction of abstract features and sensorimotor processing. Participants' movements were 2.60-3 times more efficient than random. A control simulated three strategies reproduced aspects of actual movements but lacked full-loop interaction between belief and eyeovement. The ideal model quantified amount of information accumulated image over revealings for different strategies. Most studies not addressed interplay between gathering and selection of natural active sensing. Our shows high-efficiency is a strategy humans adopt without deliberation, evidenced by inter-sadic intervals and reaching asymptotic efficiency in first session.

    Title: Molecular determinants of large cargo transport into the nucleus
    Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ). Among the thousands of molecules that cross the NPC, even very large ( >15 nm ) cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomes can pass the NPC intact. For these cargoes, there is little quantitative understanding of the requirements for their nuclear import, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences ( NLSs ) and the effect of size on import efficiency. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17–36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.

   . Assaying nuclear import kinetics in an unprecedented cargo size and #NLSs range, we have shown that the requirements for transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux to the energetic requirements for nuclear transport. For small cargo transport, biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface have been shown to influence nuclear transport ( Frey et al., 2018; Naim et al., 2009 )

., 2015; Tan et al., 2018 ). We thus anticipate that basic principles of our work could also help in the future to better understand export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. The theoretical model used in this paper implicitly assumes that the capsids do not interact with each other during transport through the pore

., 2016 ). However, cargoes that present a nuclear localisation sequence ( NLS ) and bind nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs ) can rapidly enter into the nucleus. Several studies have characterized the NTR-mediated transport process, typically focusing on cargoes with one to five NLSs, and their nuclear import kinetics have been shown to follow a mono-exponential behaviour ( Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001; Kopito and Elbaum, 2007; Timney et al., 2006 )

. In these conditions, functional nucleocytoplasmic transport can be reconstituted for a few hours by adding the key components of the transport machinery: Importinβ, Importinα, RanGDP, NTF2 ( a NTR which allows recycling of RanGDP ) and GTP to the cells. Intactness of the nuclear envelope and functional nuclear transport were always validated by a set of control experiments using fluorescently labelled dextran and model cargoes ( see Materials and methods )

Cargo transport across the nuclear envelope is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells and is central to cellular viability ( Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016; Jamali et al., 2011; Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003 ). In a typical HeLa cell, more than 2000 nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) span the nuclear envelope ( Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001; Maul et al., 1972 ). With ≈120 MDa in metazoans ( Reichelt et al., 1990 ) and roughly half that weight in yeast ( Rout and Blobel, 1993; Yang et al

. Our results on large cargo import kinetics ( Figure 3 ) highlight the strikingly different #NLS requirements for the nuclear import of differently sized cargoes. We formulate here a biophysical model that considers the translocation of a large ‘spherical object’ through the crowded NPC permeability barrier ( scheme in Figure 5A ) and enables us to extract key information about the energetics of transport from our kinetic data

. We used a combination of spectroscopy and semi-automated microscopy assays to investigate the kinetics of nuclear import of cargoes ranging from 17 to 36 nm in diameter and with a number of NLSs between 0 and 240 in permeabilised cells. Our results uncovered the quantitative dependence of cargo size and NLS number in an understudied size range

. Surface properties such as charge or hydrophobicity have been frequently indicated to influence the import properties through the nuclear pore complex of smaller cargoes, which in many cases were systematically assessed by creating large data sets in which the cargo properties were carefully studied and/or tuned ( Frey et al., 2018; Naim et al., 2009; Colwell et al., 2010 )

., 2018; Naim et al., 2009 ). While we do not claim that surface effects play no role in large cargo transport, based on the prediction from our experimental assay we would suggest that the binding of multiple Importin complexes seem to partially mask the cargo surface properties. Our work significantly expands the range of sizes and #NLSs for which nuclear import has been characterised: Tu et al

. Collectively, this suggests that 36 nm capsids might be able to enter the NPC barrier, but are too large to pass the NPC intact into the nucleus ( i. e. undock or release ). We, thus, focus our global quantitative analysis on the three capsids for which we could experimentally identify conditions of functional import and nuclear enrichment

., 1998 ), the NPC is among the largest macromolecular complexes found inside the cell. NPCs are the gatekeepers of nucleocytoplasmic transport and restrict access of cargoes larger than the typically reported threshold of 40 kDa ( Paine et al., 1975; Keminer and Peters, 1999; Mohr et al., 2009 ), albeit recent work points to a rather ‘soft’ barrier model and a gradual decrease of passive transport rates with size ( Timney et al., 2016 )

., 2006 ). NPCs are remarkable in the diversity of sizes of cargoes they can transport, ranging from import of nuclear proteins ( including histones and transcription factors ), to viral import and nuclear export of pre-ribosomal subunits and mRNA complexes ( Panté and Kann, 2002; Grünwald and Singer, 2010; Grünwald et al., 2011; Babcock et al., 2004; Mor et al., 2010; Au and Panté, 2012 )

. As the transport of many large cargoes is believed not to irreversibly alter the structure of the NPC, substantial amounts of FG Nups mass must be displaced in order to facilitate such transport events. In addition to dynamics in the permeability barrier, dilation mechanisms in the scaffold structure itself have also been suggested ( Beck and Hurt, 2017 ). Despite its high biological relevance, nuclear transport of large cargoes is still poorly understood

., 2009 ), its mechanical stability and rigidity are likely to play a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport: the import rate of proteins is inversely correlated with its mechanical stability ( Infante et al., 2019 ), and flexibility is likely relevant for the transport of large deformable synthetic cargoes, such as polymer vesicles ( Zelmer et al., 2020 )

. A more complete picture of nuclear transport and refined model building in the future would require taking into account additional features in more detail, such as docking and undocking from the barrier, more realistic modelling of the capsid cargo passage through the pore, and complex entropic effects of capsid-FG Nup interactions

. Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the full dataset overlaid with the mono-exponential fits. In absence of NLSs ( 0 NLSs ), all capsids localised to the cytoplasm and no targeting to the nuclear envelope or accumulation in the nucleus was observed, in line with an Importin-dependent pathway. With increasing #NLSs present on the capsid surface we observed progressive nuclear envelope targeting, and eventually, efficient accumulation of cargo in the nucleoplasm

. Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows additional control experiments ( addition of the Importinα export receptor CAS to transport mix and excess of GTP or Importinα ) to establish that the observed saturating nuclear import depends on the substrate size and #NLSs and is not due to any of the components in the transport mix becoming limiting during the course of the experiment

., 2003 ). To this end, all nuclear import curves were fitted with a mono-exponential kinetic model I ( t ) =A+IMAX ( 1−e−τ∗t ), with IMAX being the plateau value reached by the fit at infinity, τ the reaction constant with units 1/s and A is the offset parameter. A accounts for any nonzero offset, which could be due to: i ) initial recruitment of the cargoes to the cells and nuclear envelope

Our approach based on modified capsids with tuneable surface properties and quantitative imaging in permeabilised cells enabled us to arrive at a substantially enhanced quantitative understanding of large cargo transport through the NPC

. The final steady state accumulation and the late kinetics of the capsid import are affected by a number of factors that are still incompletely understood – such as the competition between Ran and NTRs for the capsid surface, the entropic effects of capsid-FGup interactions and the mechanical properties of the capsid itself.

    Title: CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for helper T cell responses and protective immunity to infection
    Abstract: The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 is essential for activation of helper T cells. Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4+ T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming.

CD4+ T cells play a central role in immunity to C

., 2002; Riley et al., 2002 ). CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4+ T cell activation ( Harding et al., 1992 ), including proliferation, survival ( Boise et al., 1995 ), glucose metabolism ( Frauwirth et al., 2002 ), and migration ( Marelli-Berg et al., 2007 ). Consequently, CD28-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4+ T cells and do not form T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) and T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells after infection or immunization

. Tfh differentiation requires CD28 ligation during interactions of primed T cells with B cells and fully differentiated Tfh cells require CD28 expression for their survival. By contrast, Th1 cells do not require CD28 for their maintenance, but do for their expansion following T cell activation. Furthermore, Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice are unable to clear Citrobacter rodentium from their gastrointestinal tract following oral infection

. The authors show that deletion of CD28, after clearance of the first infection and prior to re-infection, resulted in fewer Th2 cells and Tfh cells forming in response to secondary infection. This demonstrates that CD28 signaling is required for the initiation of the CD4+ memory T cell response, in addition to being required throughout the primary immune response to infection

. The expression of CD28 and its ligands increases progressively after priming, raising the possibility that CD28 signaling is utilized during the effector phase of the immune response. Despite the central role of CD28 signaling in T cell biology, a role for sustained CD28 expression in CD4+ T cell subset differentiation and maintenance has not been described. This is likely to be because the role for CD28 after T cell priming is difficult to determine experimentally

., 1999; Bertram et al., 2002 ). From this extensive body of literature, it is clear that CD28 signaling plays an essential role in CD4+ T cell priming and the formation of effector T cell subsets, but this has made it difficult to determine whether CD28 signaling also contributes to the ongoing immune response, as downstream phenotypes may be due to defective initial activation of CD28-deficient T cells

. Together, this indicates that the interactions between CD28 and CD80 may be important for maintaining the Tfh population, and that the dominant role of CD86 in promoting Tfh formation is likely to be driven by interactions with CD28, rather than CTLA4. The results presented here demonstrate that continued CD28 signaling is required following T cell activation for an effective primary CD4+ T cell response to infection

. To determine whether there is a role for CD28 signaling after T cell activation, we generated a strain of Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice where CD28 expression is lost after T cell priming. We show that the numbers of both Tfh and Th1 cells are reduced in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice after influenza A virus infection, although, surprisingly, the requirement for CD28 on each cell type is distinct

. The role for CD28 on activated T cells is particularly pertinent as CD28 expression is lost on a proportion of activated T cells with age, in HIV infection, and in the number of immune disorders in primates ( but not rodents ) ( Weng et al., 2009; Aberg, 2012; Broux et al., 2012 ), and the functional consequence of this loss of CD28 is unknown

. Our data reveal that CD28 is not only important for T cell activation, but that it also plays important roles in the ongoing immune response. Therapeutic targeting of CD28 would therefore be expected to effectively dampen established T cell responses as well as interfering with priming

. These studies support the possibility for a role for CD28 in an ongoing immune response. However, attributing these phenotypes to a role for continued CD28 expression in established immune responses is not possible because CD28 signaling is blocked on all cells, and not only on previously activated T cells

., 2002 ). As continued CD28 was dispensable for Th1 maintenance, we investigated whether CD28 signaling was important for Th1 expansion beyond day 5 post infection. A smaller proportion of IFNγ+CD44highCD4+ medLN Th1 cells was detected in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice ( Figure 6C ) at 7 days post infection, just after the reported peak of CD4+ T cell expansion ( Roman et al., 2002 )

. Taken together, this illustrates that CD28 is a critical co-stimulatory molecule throughout the effector phase of the response to infection, which has significant implications for applied immunology.

. As our previous data had shown that maintained CD28 signaling was required for both Th1 and Tfh cells, we asked whether CD28 was also required for their regulatory counterparts: T-bet+CXCR3+Foxp3+CD4+ Th1-type Tregs cells that form during type 1 inflammation ( Koch et al., 2009 ) and Bcl-6+CXCR5+Foxp3+CD4+ T follicular regulatory cells that participate in the germinal center response ( Chung et al., 2011; Linterman et al., 2011; Wollenberg et al., 2011 )

. CD28-deficient helper T cells do not become activated, and thus cannot be used to evaluate the role for CD28 after T cell priming. Moreover, CD28 has two ligands, CD80 and CD86, which it shares with the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ). Consequently, manipulating CD80/86 cannot be used to draw conclusions on the role of CD28 alone, as CTLA-4 ligation will also be affected

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03180. 009 Loss of CD28 after T cell activation impairs the Th1 response over the course of an infection because at day 12, but not at day 5, post infection there are fewer Th1 cells in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice compared with controls ( Figure 2E, F )

. However, we show that reducing expression of either ICOS or Bcl-XL alone was not sufficient to recapitulate the reduction in Tfh cell number seen in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice. This suggests that, like its role during T cell priming, CD28 signaling in activated T cells changes the expression of a large number of molecules, which together contribute to a reduced fitness of activated CD4+ T cells that have lost CD28

This impaired the formation of CXCR5+Bcl-6+CD4+ Tfh-precursors ( Figure 3I ), supporting data from Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice showing that CD28 signaling is required after T cell priming for Tfh differentiation, at a time point where B cells are the major antigen presenting cells for Tfh differentiation. The germinal center is rich in CD28 ligands, CD80 and CD86, which are expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells. CD28 deficient T cells are unable to interact with these ligands and thus cannot differentiate into Tfh

The study demonstrates that continued CD28 is required for the expansion of Th1 and Tfh cells during infection, and for the clearance of Citrobacterium rodent from the gastrointestinal tract. This indicates that CD28 plays a role in the effector phase of the immune response, in addition to its established role in T cell priming.

    Title: Distinct cytoskeletal proteins define zones of enhanced cell wall synthesis in Helicobacter pylori
    Abstract: Helical cell shape is necessary for efficient stomach colonization by Helicobacter pylori, but the molecular mechanisms for generating helical shape remain unclear. The helical centerline pitch and radius of wild-type H. pylori cells dictate surface curvatures of considerably higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures than those present in straight- or curved-rod H. pylori. Quantitative 3D microscopy analysis of short pulses with either N-acetylmuramic acid or D-alanine metabolic probes showed that cell wall growth is enhanced at both sidewall curvature extremes. Immunofluorescence revealed MreB is most abundant at negative Gaussian curvature, while the bactofilin CcmA is most abundant at positive Gaussian curvature. Strains expressing CcmA variants with altered polymerization properties lose helical shape and associated positive Gaussian curvatures. We thus propose a model where CcmA and MreB promote PG synthesis at positive and negative Gaussian curvatures, respectively, and that this patterning is one mechanism necessary for maintaining helical shape.

    Supporting Text:
   . To investigate how H. pylori achieves diameter control while simultaneously maintaining sidewall curvature, we employed two metabolic probes to investigate PG synthesis patterning in H. pylori. Using superresolution microscopy and 3D quantitative image analysis, we show that synthesis is enhanced at negative Gaussian curvature as well as at a limited range of positive Gaussian curvatures. We furthermore investigate the localization of cytoskeletal proteins MreB and CcmA

. We propose that MreB promotes the peak of PG synthesis we observed at negative Gaussian curvature given its preference for this curvature in H. pylori and its role in localizing PG synthesis activity in other organisms. To enable maintenance of high sidewall curvature in the presence of the MreB-driven straight-rod cell growth pattern, we suggest that H. pylori augments the default rod pattern by means of enhanced growth at the major axis area that is independent of MreB ( Figure 11C )

. pylori leverages the bactofilin CcmA, which localizes preferentially to the major helical axis area, to promote synthesis at positive Gaussian curvatures on the sidewall and supplements the MreB-associated enhanced synthesis that is enriched at negative Gaussian curvatures ( the minor helical axis ) ( Figure 11C, right ). Adding the contribution of CcmA to the PG synthesis patterning allows H. pylori to maintain curvatures in the presence of MreB-associated PG synthesis

. We demonstrate that, as in straight-rod shaped E. coli cells, MreB is enriched at negative curvature. CcmA is enriched at the window of positive Gaussian curvatures where enhanced synthesis is observed. We propose that both MreB and CcmA help maintain PG synthesis activity locally and that PG synthesis patterning is one mechanism that plays a fundamental role in helical cell shape maintenance.

. We also do not know if super-twisting of the cell wall occurs during growth: does PG on the major axis remain at the major axis as the cell grows? We employed sophisticated computational tools to demonstrate that H. pylori must achieve a much broader distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature than the curved-rod bacteria C. crescentus and V. cholerae and that it uses distinct mechanisms to achieve these curvatures

. The relative organization of path orientations decreases with an increase in rod diameter, suggesting that filament orientation is sensitive to changes in cell surface curvatures ( Hussain et al., 2018 ). Here, we demonstrate that the surface of helical H. pylori cells is characterized by large regions of both positive and negative Gaussian curvature. To investigate how H

. Although it is not currently possible to computationally define the helical axes on surface reconstructions of actual cells due to their imperfections, our data indicate that we can use Gaussian curvatures of 5 µm−2 and −11 µm−2 as a proxy for the major and minor axes, respectively, in population level data. Since a helical cell must maintain large regions of positive and of negative curvatures, we hypothesized that H. pylori may have a different growth pattern than that of E

. The cytoskeletal protein MreB has been shown in rod-shaped organisms to preferentially localize to negative Gaussian curvatures near to and below zero and help direct PG synthesis ( Bratton et al., 2018; Ursell et al., 2014 ). It has been reported that MreB is not essential in H. pylori and that treatment with the MreB inhibitor A22 does not alter cell shape ( Waidner et al

. To be able to maintain curvature in the presence of MreB, the curved-rod shaped Gram-negative Proteobacteria Caulobacter crescentus and Vibrio cholerae appear to limit relative levels of PG synthesis at negative curvatures through the action of long, cell-spanning cytoskeletal filaments ( CreS and CrvA ) that preferentially localize to the minor axis ( negative Gaussian curvature ) and enable cells to increase relative synthesis rates on the opposite side of the wall ( positive Gaussian

. Given that there is still some curvature in ΔccmA cells, it is not necessarily surprising that there is still some enrichment at positive Gaussian curvature. CcmA is one of a suite of proteins required for helical cell shape maintenance; it is possible that other cell shape proteins can influence PG synthesis to promote some limited curvature in the absence of CcmA, consistent with multiple complementary mechanisms being required for helical shape maintenance

Unlike straight-rod shaped bacteria, helical H. pylori cells maintain distinct and diverse cell surface curvatures along the sidewall ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). To characterize the cell surface curvature features of H. pylori in detail, we stained permeabilized cells with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ), which binds GlcNAc and thus labels the cell wall. Since the dimensions of H. pylori cells ( 1. 5–3. 5 µm in length and 0

. It is still unclear which structures are relevant and if altering higher-order structures abolishes CcmA function by disrupting protein-protein interactions and/or CcmA localization. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which MreB-patterned straight-rod shape is the default pattern for H. pylori cells and helical shape is facilitated by adding major axis area PG synthesis via CcmA to augment straight-rod cell wall patterning

. While such a growth pattern is at odds with maintaining areas of negative and positive Gaussian curvature required for curved- and helical-rod shapes, MreB is present in many bacteria with these shapes

. A major outstanding question is how H. pylori enhances PG synthesis activity at the major axis area. Our 3D analysis establishes that the average Gaussian curvature along the major axis is distinct from that along the minor axis ( 5 vs. −11 µm−2, respectively ) and that the major axis is on average 70% longer than the minor axis in the strain used here

. The sidewall curvature distribution informed us about the overall types of surface curvature wild-type cells need to achieve, but was not sufficient to let us directly compare the surface properties of the major and minor axes, specifically the relative lengths of the major and minor axes and the average Gaussian curvature along both axes. Furthermore, prior shape parameter characterizations of H. pylori have been performed using 2D images ( Martínez et al., 2016; Sycuro et al

. Bactofilins are bacteria-specific cytoskeletal proteins with diverse functions, including playing a role in stalk elongation in Caulobacter crescentus ( Kühn et al., 2010 ) and helical pitch modulation in Leptospira biflexa ( Jackson et al., 2018 ). CcmA loss in H. pylori results in rod-shaped cells with minimal sidewall curvature ( Sycuro et al., 2010 ). As with other organisms, H. pylori CcmA has been shown to self-oligomerize ( Holtrup et al., 2019 )

Helicobacter pylori is a helical Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach and can cause stomach ulcers and gastric cancers ( Correa, 1988 ). Helical cell shape is necessary for efficient stomach colonization ( Bonis et al., 2010; Sycuro et al., 2012; Sycuro et al., 2010 ), underscoring its importance. H

. The enrichment of new cell wall synthesis to both negative Gaussian curvature, as expected for straight-rod shape, and to the major axis area indicates one mechanism for achieving helical shape, but it is not apparent how this growth pattern on its own could be sufficient for helical shape maintenance

., 2010 ), underscoring its importance. H. pylori is a main model organism for studying helical cell shape, in part due to its helical shape being necessary for colonization ( Bon et al. 2010; Suro et al 2012; Suro et 2010 ). The helical shape of H. pylori is characterized by large regions of both positive and negative Gaussian curv ( Figure 1, Figure 2 ), unlike curved-rod bacteria such as C cresus and V cholera which have lower curvatures ( Hussain et al 2018 Cen et al 2009 )

    Title: Cdc48 regulates a deubiquitylase cascade critical for mitochondrial fusion
    Abstract: Cdc48/p97, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, orchestrates the function of E3 ligases and deubiquitylases ( DUBs ). Here, we identify a new function of Cdc48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. We demonstrate that Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two DUBs, which are themselves ubiquitylated. First, Cdc48 promotes proteolysis of Ubp12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. Second, loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2 and thereby facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 inhibiting fusion. Thus, Cdc48 synergistically regulates the ubiquitylation status of Fzo1, allowing to control the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion. In conclusion, we unravel a new cascade of ubiquitylation events, comprising Cdc48 and two DUBs, fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of Fzo1.

   . We conclude that this cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion but preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that instead targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. The cascade between Ubp12 and Ubp2 also allows revising recent results linking Ubp2 and Mdm30 ( Cavellini et al., 2017 ). Mdm30 catalyzes the formation of the pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 ( Cohen et al., 2008 )

. Here, we identify a role of Cdc48 in mitochondrial fusion, as part of a novel enzymatic cascade consisting of Cdc48, Ubp12 and Ubp2. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis.

., 2013 ). The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that either promote or repress mitochondrial fusion, respectively ( Anton et al., 2013 ). Here, given that Ubp12 regulates Ubp2, we show that these two ubiquitylation pathways are connected. Consistently, on Fzo1, Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation also precedes Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation. In fact, unopposed anti-fusion ubiquitylation, as it is the case in Δubp2 cells, disrupts mitochondrial tubulation

. In conclusion, Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a very small number of ubiquitin moieties. We therefore propose that Ubp12 does not stabilize its substrates because their ubiquitin chains are too short to target proteasomal turnover. Both Ubp12 and Ubp2 deubiquitylate Fzo1, but they clearly bind different forms of ubiquitylated Fzo1 ( Anton et al., 2013 ). Ubp12 binds ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that stabilize Fzo1 and promote mitochondrial fusion

. In contrast, other ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that instead are recognized and cleaved by Ubp2 target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, although it is clear that ubiquitin is a double-faced regulator of mitochondrial fusion ( Escobar-Henriques and Langer, 2014 ), how Ubp2 and Ubp12 exert opposite effects on Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion remained poorly studied

. Finally, cdc48-2Δubp12 cells also showed improved ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( Figure 4C ). Together, these results show that Cdc48 maintains Fzo1 ubiquitylation and activates mitochondrial fusion by downregulating Ubp12. However, two pieces of evidence suggest that Cdc48 might have other functions in this pathway, apart from regulating Ubp12

. Mitochondrial fusion is a complex multistep process dependent on sequential events involving GTP binding and hydrolysis by Fzo1, Fzo1 oligomerization and finally ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( Anton et al., 2011; Brandt et al., 2016; Cohen et al., 2011; Ishihara et al., 2004 ). Although it is clear that ubiquitin critically determines mitochondrial fusion events, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown ( Anton et al., 2013 )

. First, we observed that the physical interaction between Fzo1 and Cdc48 is not mediated by Ubp12 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2D ), suggesting that Cdc48 directly recognizes ubiquitylated Fzo1. Second, deletion of UBP12 in cdc48-2 cells did not restore the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E ). Notably, this is consistent with our previous observation that mitochondrial fusion depends on ubiquitylated rather than on the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Anton et al

Cdc48 promotes degradation of Ubp12, controlling Fzo1 ubiquitylation. Ubp12 prevents mitochondrial fusion by two means. On the one hand, it removes the ubiquitylation on Fzo1 that is required for fusion. On the other hand, it promotes degradation of Ubp2. This leaves the anti-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 unopposed, resulting in Fzo1 degradation. Therefore, by supporting turnover of Ubp12, Cdc48 dually preserves mitochondrial fusion events

. In turn, Ubp2 recognizes other ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, that instead signal Fzo1 turnover thus preventing mitochondrial fusion. Given that Ubp12 acts upstream of Ubp2, we speculated that the pro-fusion ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, Ubp12-specific, would also precede its Ubp2-specific anti-fusion forms. This predicts an impairment of anti-fusion forms in the absence of pro-fusion forms

. In contrast, when only a non-functional variant of the protein is present, as is the case in cdc48-2 cells, Cdc48 cannot protect the pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1. In this case, the cascade will synergistically converge in degradation of Fzo1 and thus inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will occur. The interdependence between these two pathways contributes to a coordinated cellular decision by Cdc48 to either fuse mitochondria or instead prevent it by degrading Fzo1

. Moreover, the Cdc48-Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows fine-tuning of substrate ubiquitylation and modulation of the biological processes thereof, as exemplified for Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion ( Figure 9 ). Cdc48/p97 extracts ubiquitylated substrates from membranes, thus allowing their recognition and degradation by the proteasome ( Franz et al., 2014; Rape et al., 2001 ). This is exemplified with the ER protein Ubc6, and was also shown for mitochondrial OM proteins ( Neutzner et al

., 2013 ). Importantly, DUBs are associated with a number of human diseases and represent promising drug targets, whose regulation and mechanism of action need to be explored ( Heideker and Wertz, 2015; Sahtoe and Sixma, 2015 ). Two deubiquitylases, Ubp2 and Ubp12, were found to have opposite effects on mitochondrial morphology ( Anton et al., 2013 ). Ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that are recognized and cleaved by Ubp12 activate mitochondrial fusion

. Finally, a physical interaction between Ubp2 and Cdc48 could be observed ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ). Together our results highlight a model in which Cdc48, Ubp12 and Ubp2 orchestrate a multilayered cascade regulation, culminating on Fzo1 ubiquitylation and mitochondrial fusion.

., 2004 ). The ubiquitin-specific chaperone Cdc48/p97 is required to maintain mitochondrial morphology ( Esaki and Ogura, 2012 ). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of how Cdc48 regulates mitochondrial dynamics is not understood. Cdc48 is an essential AAA-ATPase and one of the most abundant proteins in the cell, which recognizes many ubiquitylated substrates and is involved in a myriad of biological processes ( Franz et al., 2014; Meyer and Weihl, 2014 )

. This suggested problems in mitochondrial fusion and prompted us to evaluate the role of Cdc48 on Fzo1, present at the outer membrane of mitochondria. Mitochondrial fusion is abolished in the absence of Fzo1 ubiquitylation ( Anton et al., 2013 ). Consistent with mitochondrial fragmentation, we observed a decrease of Fzo1 ubiquitylation in cdc48-2 mutant cells, when compared to wild-type ( wt ) cells ( Figure 1B, black arrows )

., 2007 ), including mitofusins under damaging conditions ( Tanaka et al., 2010 ). Therefore, Cdc48/p97 and ubiquitin regulate mitochondrial fusion in both yeast and mammals. Moreover, eukaryotes and prokaryotes have mitofins with homologous to F1 ( Anton et al,201 ), suggesting a conserved role of C48 in mitofin regulation. We show that C48 regulates Ubp and U2, two deubiqulases with opposite effects on F1 ubiquitylation and mitochondrial fusion.
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) responses to auditory and visual stimuli in sighted and congenitally blind individuals. The study aimed to determine if visual experience is necessary for the development of categorical organization in VOT. Results showed that VOT reliably encodes categories in both sight and blind individuals using a representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, VOT represents categorical membership of sounds rather than acoustic features. The study suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in VOT of congenitally blind and sight people that match the topography and functional profile of visual responses, despite nuances in categorical organization between modalities.

The study demonstrates that categorical organization similar to vision can emerge in VOT in absence of visual experience and that categorical responses to sounds are enhanced and stable in congenally blind. Previous studies have shown that occipital cortex enhances response to non-visual processing in absence of vision. The study used representational analysis to show that membership predicts represent structure of sounds in VOT in blind rather than lower-level acoustic attributes. VOT encodes categorical membership of sounds from eight categories in sight and blind using topography, represent format, and connectivity similar to the observed in response to images in vision. However, the representation of auditory stimuli in VOT exhibits different nuances compared to organization in sight people.

The study used sensory non-linguistic stimuli to investigate sensory and categorical nature of representation in VOT. One study investigated macro functional organization of V during processing auditory and visual stimuli in sight and individuals. Observation of similar structure in VOT for sounds and images in sight supports idea that intrinsic organization might be independent of vision and multisensory scaffolding constrain crossmodal in blind. The study discloses that membership is encoded in V of people using represent format not related to acoustic or structure, suggesting different reorganization in posterior region.

    Title: Robust manipulation of the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster by a fungal pathogen in the laboratory
    Abstract: Many microbes induce striking behavioral changes in their animal hosts, but how they achieve this is poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of an experimental system amenable to molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila, and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides, affixing in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior.

A fly infected with E. muscae exhibits a characteristic set of fungus-induced behaviors: shortly before sunset on its final day of life, the fly climbs to a high location ( a behavior known as ‘summiting’ ), extends its proboscis and becomes affixed to the surface via fungal holdfasts, hyphal growths that emerge through the mouthparts ( Roy et al., 2006; Balazy, 1984; Krasnoff et al., 1995 )

Following our observation that E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ invades the nervous system, we wondered if we could identify specific neuronal pathways targeted by the fungus by analyzing gene expression from fly brains during infection.

Among the most extraordinary products of evolution are microorganisms that can manipulate animal behavior to their advantage. Some of the best characterized examples of this phenomenon are found within the entomopathogenic fungi, fungal species that parasitize insect hosts. The ability to precisely manipulate insect behavior has evolved independently multiple times within the fungal kingdom and the hosts of these fungi span many insect orders ( Araújo and Hughes, 2016 )

. muscae’s infectious spores are ejected within the first approximately twelve hours of an infected host’s death, and lose infectivity within 48 hr of landing on a non-host substrate ( Kalsbeek et al., 2001 ).

Here is a summary of the article in a clear and formal tone, accessible to a general audience while maintaining scientific rigor:

Researchers have discovered a new strain of fungus, Entomophthora muscae, that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly. The fungus infects the fly and causes it to climb to a high location, extend its proboscis, and raise its wings, creating a path for the fungus to launch its spores from the fly's abdomen. The fungus invades the fly's nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which it can induce behavioral changes. The researchers believe this system will enable rapid progress in understanding how the fungus manipulates the host's behavior.

To study this phenomenon, the researchers isolated and characterized the E. mus strain and its impact on D. melanaster in the lab. They found that the fungus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to host neurons, which may be mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation. However, they consider all possible ways the fungus could alter behavior before jumping to conclusions. They imagine four mechanisms by which E mus achieves behavioral manipulation.

To gauge if E mus is capable of infecting hosts outside Drosidae, they exposed flies to E mus-infected D melanaster using a modified protocol. They observed flies died and sporulated, indicating they had been killed by the fungus. To gain a comprehensive look into how E mus progresses in D melan at the molecular level, they measured transcription changes in host and fungus at 24 time points over 5 days. They found a mix of infected and uninfected animals, early on flies phenotypically indistinguishable from uninf animals.

The work has elucidated the molecular basis of manipulation, but progress is limited by lack of genetic tools in the fungus or host and neurobiological in the host. Intriguingly, similar behaviors are induced in dians by distantly related Zygomete fungi within the Entomthora mus species. E mus control remains poorly understood, with no information at molecular in fungus or host. There have been few reports of E infection in wildros (Keller, 200; Turian W, 196; Gold,192). Researchers observed wildros in Northern California with characteristic death and fungaling E.

A infected E mus exhibits characteristic behaviors: shortly before death, it climbs, extends probis, and raises wings, creating a path for spores to launch. mus complex and hosts.

    Title: Transcriptome maps of general eukaryotic RNA degradation factors
    Abstract: RNA degradation pathways enable RNA processing, the regulation of RNA levels, and the surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells. Here we provide transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The profiles reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes. They are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs.

    In order to get a better understanding of RNA processing and degradation in a eukaryotic cell, we measured transcriptome-wide binding locations of 30 RNA degradation factors involved in mRNA deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and in RNA surveillance pathways including nuclear RNA surveillance and cytoplasmic nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) ( Figure 1A, B ). We performed PAR-CLIP in S. cerevisiae using our published protocol ( Battaglia et al

Here we report transcriptome-wide binding maps for 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast. A detailed bioinformatics analysis of these maps revealed how degradation factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and with respect to their preferred locations on RNA transcripts. Global comparisons of the profiles alongside previously published profiles of other RNA-binding factors revealed clusters of factors that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize on RNAs

. Here we used photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ( PAR-CLIP ) to systematically generate transcriptome-wide protein binding profiles for 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ). In-depth bioinformatic analysis and comparisons with previously reported PAR-CLIP data provide factor enrichment on different RNA classes and the binding behavior for mRNAs and their associated antisense transcripts

. The large variety of different RNA degradation factors poses the question how RNA degradation pathways are selected and whether the RNA sequence can influence this selection. Answering this question requires a systematic analysis of the RNA-binding profiles of the involved protein factors. Although several transcriptome profiles of the RNA degradation factors Xrn1, Rrp44, Csl4, Rrp41, Rrp6, Mtr4, Trf4, Air2 and Ski2 have been reported ( Delan-Forino et al., 2017; Milligan et al

. Finally, our dataset provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism.

. The results also give insights into how the various degradation complexes, and also different subunits in these complexes, may be involved in the degradation of different RNA species. Several conclusions can be drawn with respect to degradation pathway selection, new functions for known factors can be proposed, and several hypotheses emerge that can be tested in the future

. This is consistent with the suggestion that the factor is needed for nuclear processing of such non-coding transcripts and degradation of short-lived nuclear transcripts ( Heo et al., 2013; Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006 ). This complex distribution of cross-links for different exosome subunits to different RNA classes reflects the distinct functions of the exosome in nuclear RNA surveillance, processing of stable ncRNAs, and cytoplasmic mRNA degradation ( Zinder and Lima, 2017 )

., 2017; Milligan et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2012; Tuck and Tollervey, 2013 ), we lack transcriptome-wide binding profiles for components of the deadenylation, decapping, and NMD machineries, as well as other subunits of the exosome complex. Thus, the task of systematically analyzing the binding of subunits from all known factors involved in RNA degradation to a eukaryotic transcriptome ( ‘transcriptome mapping’ ) has not been accomplished thus far

The abundance of the different eukaryotic RNA species controls cell type and cell fate, and is determined by the balance between RNA synthesis and RNA degradation. Multiple mechanisms exist for RNA degradation ( Parker, 2012 ). RNAs are generally exported to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded with an RNA-specific rate. Such canonical turnover is critical for RNA homeostasis

. The catalytic exosome subunits Rrp44 and Rrp6 and the exosome core cross-link near the mRNA 5´ end, probably because the exosome moves rapidly from 3´→5´ and then slows down, causing extensive cross-linking. In summary, our resource of transcriptome-binding profiles for 30 RNA degradation factors reveals several hypotheses for the function of these factors that can be tested case by case in the future.

. The exosome is involved in 3´→5´ cytoplasmic mRNA degradation, and in the processing and degradation of long-lived transcripts such as tRNAs, rRNAs and sn ( o ) RNAs. The differences in exosome co-factor binding to different RNA classes ( Figure 2 ) support the hypothesis that these factors confer specificity for processing and degradation of various RNA species ( Delan-Forino et al., 2017 ). The exosome co-factor Ski2 shows cross-linking towards the 3´ end of mRNAs ( Figure 3 )

. Indeed, it was reported that TRAMP4 can add a short polyA tail on aberrant RNAs ( Wyers et al., 2005 ), which may trigger degradation by the nuclear exosome. It was also recently shown that Nrd1 and Trf4 interact, providing a basis for coupling surveillance-mediated termination to RNA degradation ( Tudek et al., 2014 )

. Normal and aberrant mRNAs can be discriminated by the translation machinery, and translationally defective mRNAs are guided to a degradation pathway. mRNAs with aberrant translation termination due to a premature translation termination codon are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) ( Losson and Lacroute, 1979 )

. 005 ( Figure 1B ). These transcriptome maps represent an extensive, high-confidence dataset of in vivo RNA-binding sites for factors involved in RNA degradation. We first compared degradation factor binding over different RNA classes. These included messenger RNA ( mRNA ), where we distinguished the 5´ untranslated region ( 5´ UTR ), the coding sequence ( CDS ), introns, and the 3´ untranslated region ( 3´ UTR )

. Taken together, the distribution of cross-links along mRNA transcripts differs between degradation complexes and in some cases also between their subunits. Pervasive transcription of the genome leads to many short-lived aberrant RNAs that must be rapidly detected and degraded in the nucleus. We previously reported that the RNA surveillance factors Nrd1 and Nab3 strongly cross-link to aberrant upstream antisense RNA that stems from bidirectional transcription ( Schulz et al., 2013 )

., 1999 ). In this closed-loop model, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mRNA are thought to be in close proximity by forming a complex between translation initiation factors binding to the 5´ cap and Pab1 associated with the 3´ end, thereby contributing to mRNA expression regulation ( Vicens et al., 2018; Wells et al., 1998 ). An alternative pathway of mRNA degradation after deadenylation is 3′→5′ degradation by the exosome and its auxiliary factors ( Anderson and Parker, 1998 )

. Therefore, RNA degradation kinetics need to be actively regulated to ensure the optimal life time for each transcript. RNA degradation can occur from both ends of a transcript, and these processes are often coupled

. To study the link between cytosolic mRNA translation and degradation, we compared the occupancy of degradation factors on mRNAs to their average codon-optimality score ( ‘transcript optimality’ ) ( Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplements 2–8A ). We found that the 5´ decapping machinery and Xrn1 preferentially bind transcripts with low transcript optimality. In contrast, the 3´ deadenylation machinery and the exosome bind more strongly to optimal transcripts

. We next focused on degradation factor distribution on mRNAs. We prepared metagene profiles showing the average occupancy of each factor around the mRNA transcription start sites ( TSS ) and the poly-adenylation ( pA ) sites, respectively ( Figure 3 ). The Pan2/Pan3 deadenylase complex and the Ccr4/Not subunits Pop2, Not1, and Caf40 all cross-link upstream of the 3´ end of mRNA with the highest enrichment at the pA site, as expected from their function in shortening the polyA tail

. During canonical mRNA turnover, degradation is thought to be initiated by shortening of the 3´ poly-adenylated ( polyA ) tail through two major deadenylation complexes, the Pan2/Pan3 and Ccr4/Not, followed by decapping and then exosome-mediated 3→5 degradation ( Anderson and Parker,1998 ).

    Title: A novel bivalent chromatin associates with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal in Arabidopsis
    Abstract: Temporal dynamics of gene expression underpin responses to internal and environmental stimuli. In eukaryotes, regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors. As one of the most potent defense compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana, camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) ( repression ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( H3K18ac ) ( activation ), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which we name as kairostat, plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants.

   . In this study, we reported the co-localization of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes and functionally examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in Arabidopsis. The results suggest that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of camalexin gene induction upon a pathogen signal

. Here, by integrating epigenomic profiles with a genome-wide metabolic network in Arabidopsis, we found that two epigenetic marks playing opposite roles on gene expression, H3K27me3 and H3K18ac, were enriched at camalexin biosynthesis and several other specialized metabolic pathways

., 2008 ). In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively. Our results provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other known mechanisms regulating camalexin genes may also affect transcriptional kinetics and metabolite accumulation

., 2014 ). It would be interesting to examine whether transcription factors that directly bind to promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes interact with proteins that can deposit or remove both epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals. The H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin and its role on the camalexin biosynthesis genes described here provide the molecular handle with which to open these lines of investigations in the future

., 2016; Zipfel et al., 2004 ). In this study, we found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac co-localized on camalexin biosynthesis genes forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin. We examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes by combining publicly available epigenomics data with genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry

Plant specialized metabolites are integral for plant-environmental interactions and defense against herbivores and pathogens. Camalexin is a prominent phytoalexin in Arabidopsis and genes associated with its biosynthesis are induced rapidly upon pathogen signals such as FLG22 ( Denoux et al., 2008; Stahl et al., 2016; Zipfel et al., 2004 )

., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2013 ), and no direct evidence is available in a whole organism context. As a first step to understand the role of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on camalexin genes, we examined the transcriptional kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes under FLG22 induction in wild type and mutant lines with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac. We selected chromatin remodeler pickle ( pkl-1 ) ( Carter et al

. In summary, the transcriptional kinetics analysis suggests that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin might control the timing of camalexin production in response to FLG22, which is partially corroborated with metabolite accumulation patterns. We next asked whether FLG22 treatment changed the relative amount of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the camalexin biosynthetic genes

Camalexin biosynthesis pathway is one of the best characterized pathways associated with specialized metabolism in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al., 2011; Frerigmann et al., 2016 ). We identified epigenetic marks enriched in the camalexin biosynthesis pathway using an omics data-driven approach by integrating 16 publicly available epigenomic profiles with Arabidopsis genome-scale metabolic network annotation

. Focusing on the camalexin biosynthesis pathway in this study, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation ( SeqChIP ) -PCR confirmed that these two marks were co-localized in vivo and formed a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants defective in H3K27m3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment

. In wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants, camalexin biosynthesis genes were activated at 30 min to 1 hr of FLG22 treatment and continued to increase their expression at later time points of the treatment. This is consistent with the previous study on induction kinetics of defense pathways, including camalexin, under FLG22 treatment ( Denoux et al., 2008 )

. Though more than 10 genes were annotated to camalexin biosynthesis pathway in the Plant Metabolic Network database, we focused on the three experimentally validated genes that are essential in synthesizing camalexin, CYP79B2, CYP71A13, and Phytoalexin Deficient 3 ( PAD3 ) ( Klein et al., 2013; Schuhegger et al., 2006Figure 2A )

. In plants treated with FLG22, the abundance of H3K18ac was significantly higher in the gene regions of CYP71A13, CYP79B2, and PAD3 compared to the mock-treated plants ( Figure 3E ). Moreover, the abundance of H3K27me3 modification was significantly lower in the regions of these genes in response to FLG22 ( Figure 3F ). These results suggest that the FLG22-induced changes of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression involve remodeling of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin

. Among them, we found several pathways, including camalexin and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways, to be significantly enriched with both epigenetic marks ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Supplementary file 1 ). To decipher the nature and function of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac dual association on controlling gene expression, we focused our investigation on the camalexin biosynthetic genes

. In mutants with reduced deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction patterns of the camalexin biosynthetic genes were disrupted. For pkl-1 and clf28 ( reduced H3K27me3 marks ), all three camalexin biosynthesis genes showed a significant induction of expression much faster than the wild type, within 5 min of FLG22 treatment, and the degree of induction was much higher than that in wild-type plants at 6 hr of the treatment ( Figure 3A to C, Supplementary file 3 to 5 )

Plants produce many metabolites that are essential for responding to environmental cues, the expression of which requires tight temporal control ( Barco and Clay, 2019; Grotewold, 2005; Martin et al., 2010 ). One of the most prominent defense metabolites from Arabidopsis thaliana is camalexin. Camalexin is an indole alkaloid derived from tryptophan and can be induced rapidly by various biotic and abiotic stimuli in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al., 2011 )

. We developed two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses about the role of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on the expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes: ( 1 ) H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are co-localized on the same genes in the same cell and control their gene expression induction; or ( 2 ) H3me3me and Hkac are localized on different genes and H3me and Hac control gene expression independently. To test these hypotheses, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP )-PCR to examine the co-localization of H3me and Hac on camin biosynthetic genes in vivo.

    Title: Distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in neurogenic astroglia
    Abstract: The epigenetic mechanisms that enable specialized astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life are still poorly understood. Here we show that astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the adult mouse subventricular zone ( SVZ ) express the histone methyltransferase EZH2. This Polycomb repressive factor is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation, as Ink4a/Arf-deficiency in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs rescues cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective. Olig2 is a direct target of EZH2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, Ezh2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells including local astroglia also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology, which has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.

   ., 2003 ). Whether PcG factors are required for other aspects of adult neurogenesis such as lineage specification is not known. In this study, we found EZH2 expression to be a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain. Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs was required for distinct functions, regulating both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification. To enable SVZ NSC self-renewal, EZH2 directly repressed the Ink4a/Arf locus

. Taken together, our studies establish EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain. Furthermore, we identify distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. These results provide novel insights into the complex role that this Polycomb repressive factor plays in normal development and gliomagenesis.

. In the human brain, EZH2 was also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting that this PRC2 factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis. Taken together, these data indicate that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population.

. Taken together, these results indicate that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis that is distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression. Furthermore, by rescuing only cell proliferation and not neuronal differentiation, Ink4a/Arf-deficiency enabled us to investigate additional roles for EZH2 in the neurogenic capacity of this astroglial population. We next tested whether reexpression of Ezh2 could rescue neurogenesis in Ezh2-deleted, Ink4a/Arf-null SVZ NSCs

., 2011 ). Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes. Acute deletion of Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis, and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation. As has been found in other stem cell systems ( Aloia et al

. Ink4a/Arf-deletion reversed the proliferation defect of Ezh2-deleted NSCs, but neurogenesis was still greatly impaired. In SVZ cells, EZH2 directly targeted Olig2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor was required for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, genome-wide transcript and chromatin analyses revealed a role for EZH2 in preventing the aberrant activation of transcriptional regulators that specify alternative neuronal lineages

Despite many immunohistological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological similarities between SVZ astrocytes and those in non-neurogenic brain regions, it is clear that astrocytes in the SVZ are distinct in their ability to produce neurons for all of adult life. Our data indicate that EZH2 is a distinguishing feature of SVZ astrocytes and in part underlies the epigenetic basis of this unique form of astrocyte heterogeneity ( Figure 6 )

. Thus, conceptually, SVZ astrocytes appear to have ‘preserved’ the multi-lineage developmental potential of their radial glial cell origin, whereas non-neurogenic astrocytes apparently ‘lose’ this stem cell characteristic ( Gonzales-Roybal and Lim, 2013 ). The expression of EZH2 strongly correlated with the neurogenic potential of glial cells along this developmental continuum

. EZH2 is expressed in embryonic radial glia and is required for proper cortical neuron differentiation ( Hirabayashi et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2010 ). We detected EZH2 expression in early postnatal radial glia, including those that give rise to the SVZ astrocytes. While EZH2 expression decreased over time in non-neurogenic brain regions, this PRC2 factor remained highly expressed in SVZ astrocytes into adulthood

. Given the well-characterized role of EZH2 in the regulation of cell proliferation in other stem cell niches ( Aldiri and Vetter, 2012 ), we investigated whether the neurogenesis defect of Ezh2 Δ/Δ SVZ NSCs was primarily a result of decreased cell proliferation

. While these data clearly indicated that EZH2 is required for proper SVZ NSC proliferation, the expression of EZH2 in type C and A cells suggested that EZH2 also plays a role in neuronal lineage specification. By deleting Ezh2 in Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs, we were able to evaluate the Ink4a/Arf-independent roles of Ezh2 in neurogenesis. This genetic strategy enabled the identification of Olig2 as a key direct target of EZH2-mediated repression

. In the 1-week old SVZ, EZH2 was detected in a subset of GFAP+ cells as well as clusters of DCX + cells ( Figure 5D ), indicating that EZH2 is expressed in cell types that correspond to cells of the neurogenic lineage. However, by 18 months of age, when SVZ neurogenesis is nearly extinct ( Sanai et al., 2011 ), EZH2+ cells were not observed in the SVZ ( Figure 5C ). Thus, EZH2 is expressed in SVZ astrocytes and neuroblasts during the period of postnatal human neurogenesis.

. OLIG2 is expressed in a subset of both type B1 and type C cells, but not in migratory neuroblasts ( Hack et al., 2005; Menn et al., 2006 ), suggesting that OLIG2 is expressed only at early stages of the SVZ neurogenic lineage. However, the epigenetic mechanisms required to repress Olig2 during neurogenesis were not known. Our results demonstrate that EZH2 is critical for Olig2 repression, which we found to be a key aspect of SVZ neurogenesis

. Furthermore, the number of cells expressing the astrocyte marker GFAP was not significantly changed in Ezh2 Δ/Δ cells, indicating that Ezh2 deletion affects neuronal but not astrocyte differentiation in vitro ( Figure 2F, G ). To investigate whether Ezh2 functions in a cell-autonomous manner to promote neurogenesis, we followed the fate of Ezh2 Δ/Δ;GFP and non-deleted GFP control SVZ NSCs cells plated at low density among a large number wild-type SVZ cells ( GFP:WT cell ratio, 1:350 )

. Below, we discuss our results in the broader contexts of neural development, brain tumor malignancy, and postnatal neurogenesis of the human brain. 10. 7554/eLife. 02439. 018Figure 6. Model of EZH2 function in maintaining the neurogenic potential of SVZ astroglia. EZH2 represses multiple targets to promote distinct and separable aspects of adult SVZ neurogenesis. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02439

. Nevertheless, for this region of the lateral ventricle SVZ, the near absence of postnatal neurogenesis correlated with the loss of astroglia expressing EZH2. This suggests that this specialized, neurogenic astrocyte population is transient in the human brain. Future studies will be required to determine whether the loss of EZH2 expression is a cause or a consequence of this decrease in SVZ neurogenic activity

. This chromatin analysis suggested that Ezh2 is required for Olig2 repression during neuronal differentiation. To investigate whether Olig2 is expressed aberrantly in Ezh2-deleted SVZ cells, we first performed ICC on Ezh2Δ/Δ;Ink4a/Arf−/− and Control;Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSC cultures. After 1, 2, and 4 d of differentiation, Ezh2-deleted cultures had a greater proportion of OLIG2+ cells ( Figure 4C, D )

., 2003 ). Given the role of Olig in SV neurogenesis, our data suggest that EZ2 represses this bHL transcription factor to prevent aberrant activation of non-neurogenic lineages in SV astrocytes. Furthermore, genome-wide and chromatin analyses indicated that EZ2 prevents the aberrant activation of transcriptional regulators that specify non-neuro lineages in SV astrocy. This is consistent with the idea that EZ2 maintains the neurogenic potential of SV astrocy by repressing non-neurogenic transcriptional programs

Our data indicate that EZ2 is required for SVZ neurogenesis and that this role is distinct from its function in Ink4/Ar repression. Ink4/deficiency in Ezh-deleted SV NSCs rescues cell proliferation but neurogenesis remains defective, suggesting that EZ2 has separable roles in SV NS biology. Furthermore, we identify Olig as a direct target of EZ2, and repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. EZ prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes in the SV. In the human, EZ2 is expressed in SV cells including astrocytes correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZ2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology with implications for regenerative and oncogenesis

Ink/deficiency in Ezh-deleted SV NS rescues cell but neurogenesis remains defective suggesting EZ has separable roles in SV biology. Furthermore, we identify Olig as direct EZ target and repression of this bHL factor critical for neuronal. EZ prevents activation of genes associated with non-SV subtypes in SV. In human, EZ expressed in SV cells including astro correlating postnatal neuro. Thus, EZ epigenetic that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocy, orchestrating separable aspects adult cell biology with implications regenerative and oncogenesis
The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the role of the histone methyltransferase EZ2 (EZH2) in the adult subventricular zone (SV) of the mouse and human brain. They found that EZ2 is expressed in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NS) in the SV and is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in SV NS proliferation. E2 is a direct target of EZ, and repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, EZ prevents the activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes in the SV. In the human, EZ is expressed in SV cells, including astrocytes, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZ is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocy, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult cell biology, with implications for regenerative and oncogenesis.

    Title: Ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria as revealed by single-cell- and meta-genomics
    Abstract: Viruses modulate microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. However, due to cultivation bottlenecks, specific virus–host interaction dynamics remain cryptic. In this study, we examined 127 single-cell amplified genomes ( SAGs ) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria isolated from a model marine oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ) to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. Infection frequencies suggest that ∼1/3 of SUP05 bacteria is viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. Observed Microviridae clonality suggests recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses posits previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. Finally, identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. Together, these results demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus–host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.

   . Here, we use single-cell genomics to directly link SUP05 viruses and their hosts across defined gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a 3-year-time interval in a model OMZ ecosystem. This spatiotemporal resolution revealed endemic patterns of co-infection between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and the occurrence of AMGs with the potential to modulate electron transfer reactions essential to SUP05 energy metabolism

. We obtained a SUP05 single-cell genomic data set spanning defined redox gradients in the Saanich Inlet water column, identified SUP05-associated viruses infecting SAGs, and used resulting virus–host pairs as recruitment platforms to estimate viral diversity, activity, dispersion, and potential impact on SUP05 population dynamics and metabolic capacity

. SUP05 Microviridae contigs were inconsistently detected due to known methodological biases associated with linker-amplified metagenome library construction ( ‘Materials and methods’ ), so we focused on dsDNA viral contigs. All 4 SUP05 Caudovirales contigs were absent from surface waters, but repeatedly detected within and below the oxycline, consistent with SUP05 water column disposition ( Figure 3A—figure supplement 1 )

Consistent with viruses encoding auxiliary metabolic genes ( AMGs, Breitbart et al., 2007 ) enabling viral reprogramming of microbial metabolic pathways ( Lindell et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2011 ), putative SUP05 phage contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase A and C positing a role for viruses in modulating the marine sulfur cycle ( Anantharaman et al., 2014 )

DsrC-like predicted protein sequences were aligned with Muscle v3. 8. 31 ( Edgar, 2004 ), and the multiple alignment was displayed with Jalview ( Waterhouse et al., 2009 ). A set of oceanic viromes and microbial metagenomes were used for comparison with SUP05 viral genomes ( Supplementary file 5 )

., 2014 ), we posit that this viral gene is functional in SUP05 sulfur cycling. Future functional characterization of viral DsrC is needed to constrain viral roles in modulating SUP05 electron transfer reactions during viral infection in the environment. While new methods and model systems for identifying virus–host interactions continue to emerge ( Tadmor et al., 2011; Allers et al., 2013; Mizuno et al., 2013; Deng et al

., 2012 ). SUP05 viral contigs were affiliated with known families of Caudovirales ( dsDNA ) and Microviridae ( ssDNA ) bacteriophages. The presence of Caudovirales is not surprising as they are commonly observed in oceanic samples ( Williamson et al., 2012; Hurwitz and Sullivan, 2013 ), including the ETSP OMZ and SUP05-dominated hydrothermal vent plumes ( Cassman et al., 2012; Anantharaman et al., 2014 )

., 2012; Anantharaman et al., 2014 ). Microviridae, however, are usually observed in surface seawater or deep-sea sediments and have not been previously associated with OMZs ( Angly et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2013; Labonté and Suttle, 2013b ). Given the SUP05 lineages described above, we note that viral contigs recovered from SUP05_01 SAGs were exclusively Caudovirales, whereas SUP05_03 SAGs contained both Caudovirales and Microviridae

While tightly choreographed virus–host abundance dynamics parallels that of cultured virus–host systems ( e. g., cyanophages—[Waterbury and Valois, 1993] ), the systematically lower ( orders of magnitude lower than typical community measurements ) virus-to-host ratios observed here indicates that a greater diversity of SUP05 viruses remains to be uncovered in the Saanich Inlet water column. 10. 7554/eLife. 03125. 013Figure 3

    Title: TTC26/DYF13 is an intraflagellar transport protein required for transport of motility-related proteins into flagella
    Abstract: Cilia/flagella are assembled and maintained by the process of intraflagellar transport ( IFT ), a highly conserved mechanism involving more than 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear. To help address this issue, we focused on a putative IFT protein TTC26/DYF13. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches we show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii, produced short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a particular set of proteins involved in motility was specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.

   . However, unlike other complex B proteins, a deletion mutant of dyf13 in C. reinhardtii still has flagella, indicating that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis per se. However, the flagella are slightly shorter with pronounced motility defects. Similar phenotypes were observed in zebrafish cilia when ttc26 was depleted

. Although IFT particle movement seems normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, specific inner dynein arm components were reduced in flagella of dyf13 mutants, indicating a specific role for TTC26/DYF13 in transport of a subset of ciliary proteins. Comparative proteomic analysis of the flagellar proteins in the dyf13 mutant supports a specific function for TTC26/DYF13 in transporting a subset of cargo proteins involved in the machinery of flagellar motility

. In contrast, because IFT56 is conserved in most ciliated organisms ( Figure 1A ) like other IFT proteins, IFT56 should have a conserved role in cilia/flagella or IFT. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of IFT56/TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella. Knockdown of IFT56 in zebrafish embryos and C. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells showed motility defects of cilia/flagella

. Therefore, unlike many other IFT proteins, TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis nor for assembly or movement of the IFT particle per se, but rather plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella.

. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells could assemble cilia/flagella but they were shorter than control cilia/flagella ( Figures 1 and 2 ). These observations coincide with C. elegans dyf-13 mutant, which has abnormal cilia with short length ( Blacque et al., 2005 ). Most other IFT proteins are necessary to assemble cilia/flagella in the first place. For example, C. reinhardtii mutants of ift46, ift52, and ift88 cannot assemble their flagella ( Pazour et al., 2000; Brazelton et al

., 1984; Kuchka and Jarvik, 1987 ). These results and fact suggest that DYF13 has a role in building a motile flagellum above and beyond its role in flagellar length. Given our results that TTC26/DYF13 has conserved roles in building full-length cilia and flagella in both zebrafish and C. reinhardtii, and given the fact that DYF-13 protein undergoes IFT motion in C. elegans ( Blacque et al

. Because IFT56 is not required for assembly of IFT complexes, we were able to perform further analyses to clarify the specific function of IFT56, which would have been impossible if complex B failed to form in the dyf13 mutant cells. We found that IFT56 was important to assemble full-length cilia/flagella. In our study, zebrafish ttc26 knockdown embryos and C

. Defects of DYF13 did not change IFT speed or frequency even though DYF13 is an IFT protein. However, C. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells clearly showed the flagella motility defects. These results raised the possibility that the DYF13 protein might be important for transporting specific cargo into the flagellum that is required for normal flagellar motility

. To clarify the function of TTC26, we analyzed TTC26/DYF13 in mammalian cultured cells, zebrafish, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results show that GFP-fused TTC26 moved bi-directionally along the length of cilia in mammalian cells just like other IFT proteins. TTC26/DYF13 was biochemically co-purified with other IFT complex B proteins in mammalian cells and in C. reinhardtii, demonstrating that TTC26/DYF13 is indeed an IFT complex B protein

. These motility defects are caused by lack of inner dynein arm components in cilia/flagella. IFT56 is not important to assemble IFT complexes but is important to transport inner dynein arms into cilia/flagella. Analysis of a suppressor mutant of ift46 has revealed that IFT46 is required for transport of outer dynein arms into flagella ( Hou et al., 2007; Ahmed et al., 2008 ). Some cilia/flagella proteins are known to be pre-assembled before entering the cilia/flagella ( Qin et al

. 1 ± 4. 7 Hz; Figure 3H, blue; Video 6 ). Expression of HA-tagged DYF13 rescued these phenotypes ( data not shown ), confirming the mutation in DYF13 was the cause of the phenotypes. Thus, the shorter flagellar length and reduced beating frequency of the dyf13 mutant were consistent with that of zebrafish ttc26 morphants. Thus, in both zebrafish and C. reinhardtii, TTC26/DYF13 is required for assembly of full-length cilia with normal functions. 10. 7554/eLife. 01566. 010Figure 3

. reinhardtii genome ). Such a mutant provides a key tool to clarify the molecular function of TTC26/DYF13 because it lets us exploit the advantages of C. reinhardtii as a model organism for biochemical and cellular studies of cilia and flagella. To obtain such a mutant, we checked the previously uncharacterized C

. In this study, we demonstrated that the mouse cilia proteome candidate TTC26 is an IFT complex B protein with a specific role in transporting a subset of ciliary cargoes related to ciliary motility and for assembling cilia of full length.

. Most of the proteins reduced in dyf13 mutant flagella ( shown as a negative value in Supplementary file 1B ) have been described in the literature as being involved in flagella motility, including FAP59, Enolase, RIB72, PF2, and centrin ( see ‘Discussion’ for details ). This result indicates that DYF13 is important to transport other components of motility regulatory machineries, such as the dynein regulatory complex and the central pair complex, as well as inner dynein arms

. These results demonstrate that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein, in both vertebrates and C. reinhardtii. 10. 7554/eLife. 01566. 016Figure 5. DYF13 is a part of IFT complex B.

The sucrose density gradient fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting

., 2005 ). Thus, these proteins depleted from flagella in the dyf13 mutant are all connected to flagellar motility, rather than flagellar assembly, suggesting a primary role for IFT56/TTC26/DYF13 in carrying motility-related cargoes. Consistent with this picture, IFT56 is not conserved in Thalassiosira pseudonana or Physcomitrella patens, which lack putative inner dynein and outer dynein homologues, respectively ( Wickstead and Gull, 2011 )

( B ) Western blotting images of IFT proteins in wild-type and dyf13 mutant flagella. Relative amounts of IFT proteins did not change between wild-type and dyf13 mutant flagella. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01566. 022 Taken together, these results indicate that TTC26/DY13 is an IFT B protein in mammalian cells and C reinhardtii and plays a role in transporting a subset of ciliary proteins involved in flagellar motility.

    Title: Lymphatic endothelium stimulates melanoma metastasis and invasion via MMP14-dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation
    Abstract: Lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis correlate with poor clinical outcome in melanoma. However, the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination in distant metastasis remain incompletely understood. We show here that exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells, but not singly invasive Bowes cells, to lymphatic endothelial cells ( LEC ) in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant organ metastasis in mice. To dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, we established LEC co-cultures with different melanoma cells originating from primary tumors or metastases. Notably, the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix that was dependent on MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. Moreover, MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. This study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype.

    Supporting Text:
   . We found that the interaction of melanoma cells with LECs induced matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP ) -dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation in the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells, leading to invasive sprouting of cells in 3D matrices. Importantly, the interaction of these melanoma cells with LECs led to significantly increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3

. Here we investigated the consequences of such interactions by coupling unique 2D and 3D LEC-melanoma co-culture models to in vivo mouse tumor model, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay. In the xenograft mouse model, dissemination of the metastatic WM852 cell line to distant organs was increased by LEC priming

., 2011 ). In this study, we set to investigate how the LECs in the tumor microenvironment affect the metastatic melanoma cell phenotype. To this end, we implemented 2D- and 3D melanoma-LEC co-culture models, which enable a systematic analysis of the molecular crosstalk between the tumor cells and the lymphatic endothelium

., 2014 ). Although Notch receptors 1 and 3 are highly activated in melanoma with clear pro-tumorigenic functions, no Notch-activating mutations have been identified in melanoma. Therefore, the herein identified MMP14 dependent Notch3 upregulation may prove important in metastatic melanoma progression. Our results also revealed that LEC contact induced β1-integrin activation in the metastatic WM852 and WM165 cells, which was required for the 3D sprouting of WM852* cells

. The upregulation of Notch3 upon LEC priming provides strong support that our LEC-melanoma interaction model can reveal clinically relevant molecules for cancer dissemination and thus has high potential also for identifying previously unrecognized pathways and molecules contributing to the lymphatic metastasis of melanoma

. To address if the LEC induced NOTCH3 increase was specific for WM852 melanoma cells, we co-cultured two additional melanoma cell lines derived from vertical growth phase primary tumor ( WM793 ) and metastasis ( WM165 ) ( Tatti et al., 2011 ) with LECs and analysed the co-cultures for Notch3 expression by indirect immunofluorescence analysis ( IFA )

. Furthermore, in vitro molecular and functional studies revealed that the direct contact of LECs with metastatic melanoma cell lines triggered changes particularly in the localization of MMP14, an important protease for cancer-cell invasion ( Tatti et al., 2015; Turunen et al., 2017 ), which in turn induced expression and activation of Notch3 and activation of β1-integrin leading to a significant change in the 3D growth phenotype of the melanoma cells

. This suggests that the LEC-induced transient, invasively sprouting phenotype of melanoma cells is mediated by activated Notch3 and β1-integrin both dependent on the key upstream regulator MMP14

. Our pathway enrichment analysis revealed Notch signaling pathway to be upregulated in the melanoma cells after LEC priming ( Figure 2a–b ). Previous studies using co-culture of HUVECs and melanoma cells have identified Notch3 as a player in melanoma–EC communication ( Stine et al., 2011 ) and a potential mediator of melanoma metastasis also in human tumors ( Howard et al., 2013 )

. Although melanoma cells at the primary tumor site predominantly disseminate through the lymphatic vascular route, the distant organ metastasis requires cells entering blood circulation and colonization in the distant organ tissue. MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin are all proteins linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma cell metastasis ( Cao et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2012; Liu et al

. Fittingly, WM852 cells with strong intrinsic capacity to grow expansively, switched to the invasively sprouting growth phenotype after the LEC-mediated transient activation of the MMP14-Notch3-β1-integrin axis, which resulted in increased MMP14 and Notch3 dependent metastasis in vivo. The LEC contact likewise switched the metastatic, expansively growing WM165 cells to invasive sprouting via activation of MMP14-Notch3-β1-integrin axis

., 2010 ). However, as our transcriptomic data of the LEC-primed melanoma cells did not reveal changes in ICAP-1 expression upon LEC-priming it probably does not play a significant role in the Notch3-dependent invasive sprouting of metastatic melanoma cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that β1-integrin functions downstream of Notch3 in the LEC-primed melanomas

. Subsequent analyses of the WM852* or Bowes* derived tumors revealed melanoma cell invasion into the lymphatic vessels in a manner similar to the in vitro 3D co-cultures ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1c ). To assess whether the LEC priming of melanoma cells affected their metastatic capacity in vivo, we imaged lymph nodes, lungs and livers isolated from the mice bearing WM852/WM852* or Bowes/Bowes* derived tumors

. Especially the WM852 cells ( and Bowes to a lesser extent ) appeared to disrupt the spheroid structure at the melanoma cell-LEC contact sites, as shown by the loss of the endothelial adhesion molecule PECAM ( Figure 1b, enlarged inserts of the middle and rightmost panels ). Thus, our 3D co-culture model qualitatively recapitulates attraction, migration and invasion of melanoma cells into lymphatic endothelial structures

. Thus, the crosstalk with LECs promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch to invasively sprouting melanoma cells.

Melanoma cells have been shown to be in close contact with the lymphatic vessels in human specimens and often metastasize via the lymphatic system, ( Niakosari et al., 2008 ), implying that the melanoma cell-LEC interactions are common events in human melanomas. In addition, clinical data correlating metastatic spread with lymphatic infiltration suggest that melanoma-LEC interactions could contribute to the tumor progression and metastasis

. In concordance with the non-metastatic origin of the Bowes cells, mice with monotypic Bowes or Bowes* had luciferase positive tumor cells in few of the isolated lymph nodes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1e ) and no significant metastasis to liver or lungs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1g ). These results indicate that the in vitro interaction of WM852 metastatic melanoma cells with LECs prior to tumor implantation promotes distant organ metastasis in vivo

., 2014; Villanueva and Herlyn, 2008 ). Our results demonstrate that the LEC contact increased MMP14 on the melanoma cell plasma membrane and cell-cell contacts in the metastatic melanoma cell lines. This was accompanied with an MMP14-dependent increase in Notch3 expression by a yet unidentified mechanism. MMP14 was recently shown to interact with and activate Notch1 at the cell membrane of melanoma cells, which supported melanoma cell growth ( Ma et al., 2014 )

. To gain more insight into the metastasis-promoting mechanisms of LECs on melanoma cells, we investigated their ability to grow in 3D fibrin matrix. Matrix embedded WM852* and WM165* cells displayed a different morphology forming string-like, sprouting cell colonies ( Figure 3a ), and resembling cells undergoing collective invasion. In contrast, the non-primed control cells from monotypic cultures formed round sphere-like colonies in fibrin ( Figure 3a )

. These data further support that L-primed melanoma cells adopt an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, dependent on MMP-Notch-β-integr activation

Our results indicate that the interaction of melanoma cells with Ls induces a reversible switch from 3D growth to invas sprouting melanoma cells via the MMP-Notch-β-intin axis.

    Title: MicroRNA-9 controls dendritic development by targeting REST
    Abstract: MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are conserved noncoding RNAs that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain. Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

    Supporting Text:
    The results of this study define a key role for miR-9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons. We present a new double reporter mouse line that helped to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. The analysis of the miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line showed that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission

. Here, we describe for the first time a conditional transgenic sponge mouse model. We derived two different strains for in vivo analysis: ( i ) a reporter mouse line to monitor miR-9 activity with single-cell resolution and ( ii ) a line for miR-9 loss-of-function studies. Using the latter, we revealed a novel developmental role of miR-9 in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons, as a key regulator of dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo

. In this study, we focused in the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. Other miRNAs have also been shown to influence dendritic growth ( Wayman et al., 2008; Fiore et al., 2009; Parrish et al., 2009; Magill et al., 2010; Pathania et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b ) suggesting that the expression of genes orchestrating this process is under a complex post-transcriptional regulation

., 2004 ), suggesting that miR-9/REST regulation might play other non-developmental roles in some mature neuronal populations. In summary, we describe the first transgenic sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of an miRNA family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Analysis of this miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line reveals a prominent role for miR-9 on postmitotic neuronal differentiation as a regulator of dendritic development through repression of REST expression.

. This indicates that effects found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice are essentially cell-intrinsic and that miR-9 exerts its proactive function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Furthermore, we found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge expressing mice

. Importantly, by performing ex vivo gene transfer of REST shRNAs into neural precursors, we determined that the increased REST activity in miR-9 sponge neurons is underlying the impairment in dendritic growth. However, the fact that the rescue of the dendritic defects was extensive but not complete, suggests that other miR-9-regulated proteins may also contribute to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9 sponge expressing neurons

. The cell-intrinsic nature of the effects of the GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge indicates that miR-9 regulates neuronal targets primarily involved in the process of dendritogenesis. To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which miR-9 affects dendritic growth, we used quantitative PCR to determine the expression levels of several predicted miR-9 neuronal targets ( Supplementary file 1 )

. miR-9*, encoded by the same miRNA precursor as miR-9, has been postulated to contribute to activity-dependent dendritic growth, although no direct evidence was shown ( Yoo et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, expression of FC sponges directed to miR-9* showed no effects on dendritic growth ( Figure 1A–C ). In addition, we found that miR-9 overexpression in hippocampal neurons did not affect total dendritic length and had only a mild impact on dendritic complexity ( data not shown )

. Experiments using primary neurons and in utero gene transfer approaches indicate that the observed dendritic changes are cell-autonomous. Importantly, we described an essential function of miR-9 in dendritic growth as a regulator of the expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. The widespread involvement of miRNAs in both the regulation of developmental and physiological processes and disease is well established ( Bushati and Cohen, 2007; Bartel, 2009; Han et al., 2013 )

. Together, these results indicate that miR-9, but not miR-9*, participates in the developmental programs controlling dendritic growth and that endogenous mir-9 levels have a saturating effect of on dendritic maturation. 10. 7554/eLife. 02755. 003Figure 1. miR-9 regulates dendritic development.

., 2005; Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2007; Simo and Cooper, 2012 ). MiR-9 downregulation would lead to the increase in transcriptional rates of direct miR-9 targets. This suggests that the factor/s mediating the effects of miR-9 inhibition in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice would fit best with targets negatively influencing cellular processes potentially involved in dendritic maturation

. Our studies in cultured primary neurons associated to the morphological analysis performed in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice suggests that neuronal miR-9 mainly acts in a cell-intrinsic manner controlling dendritic differentiation genetic programs

Scale bar: 100 μm

. In this study, we aimed to characterize a potential role for miR-9 in dendritic and spine development in vivo. In order to efficiently knock-down miR-9 in a living animal, we employed miRNA sponges as a long-lasting miRNA inhibition strategy. miRNA sponges are transcripts that carry several in tandem copies of a sequence complementary to the miRNA of interest in their 3′UTRs ( Ebert et al., 2007 )

. 9 kcal/mol vs Bg sponge: −32 kcal/mol ) and a higher sensitivity as reporters ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). This last feature might be crucial for precise analysis of miR-9 expression and activity in vivo. To define a potential role of miR-9 in the maturation of dendritic arbors and spines, we used transiently transfected sponge constructs in developing mouse primary hippocampal neurons

. Furthermore, we show that regulation of the transcriptional repressor REST by miR-9 is essential for normal dendritic maturation.

. Since the morphology and density of dendritic spines were not affected, the reduced postsynaptic responses are most likely due to a reduction in the total number of synapses as expected from less-arborized dendrites ( Kawabe et al., 2010 ), as those found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice. Additionally, we showed that inhibiting miR-9 affects neuronal excitability by shifting the AP threshold to more positive potentials

. In contrast, overexpression of other miR-9 targets that were found to be upregulated in sponge expressing neurons, such as Foxp4, Creb1, and Map1b, had no effect on dendritic length and complexity ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ), indicating that they are not contributing to the dendritic phenotype of miR-9-SpNestin-Cre neurons

. In view of these facts, other functional products in addition to miR-9 might contribute to the phenotype of miR-9-SNest-C mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that mi-9 plays a key role in the postmit differentiation of neurons as a regulator of dendritic growth and synaptic transmission through the repression of the transcriptional repressor REST.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of social engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups. They found that ASD-related hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DM) and visual and attention networks. A subtype of ASD with pronounced social visual difficulties, Geo ASD, was characterized by marked DM-occipital cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. Increased DM-OT hypoconnectivity was related to severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in Geo ASD. Early social-visual hypoconnect is a key neurobiological feature of Geo ASD and may be critical for future social-communic development and new targets for early intervention.

The study used a simple eye-tracking test to identify Geo ASD with high precision in early development. Social-visual hypoconnect is a key neurobi feature of Geo ASD and may be critical for social development. Although visual difficulties are early features of ASD, the neural basis is not well understood. The study found evidence for atypical functional brain organization in ASD involving social circuitry relevant to visual engagement. The DM is functionally disconnected from visual cortices and attention in the first 4 years of life. This is important for why social difficulties are a symptom in ASD and shared across toddlers.

The results suggest heterogeneity in social engagement is important for some, but not all, connectivity differences in ASD. This supports the idea that ASD is characterized by hypoconnect between DM and visual circuits in PVC and OTC as well as attention. The study aimed to identify how functional connectivity is affected in ASD and whether heterogeneity in social engagement is a factor. Geo ASD is behaviorally more severe on different domains, but connectivity is specific to Geo. Non-ASD with developmental delay do not show effects. The magnitude of DM-OT hypoconnect specific to Geo was associated with social difficulties on a diagnostic instrument.

The study identified hypoconnect between social circuit, DM, and low-level networks in early ASD. This warrants further investigation and suggests development between social and attention networks may be key to ASD symptoms. The study goes beyond case-control designs and identifies heterogeneity in a subtype that comprises 20% of ASD. DM-P hypoconnect is reduced across ASD, but DM-OT is reduced in Geo. Variation in DMOT is associated with difficulties, but only in Geo. The study hypothesized Geo may display extreme effects on connectivity. To test the utility of Geo for predicting social symptomatology, relationships between connectivity and behavior were apparent only in Geo. Different engagement may lead to experience-dependent development in ASD, resulting in behavioral and neural subtypes with shared abnormalities specific to ASD.

    Title: Drosophila sessile hemocyte clusters are true hematopoietic tissues that regulate larval blood cell differentiation
    Abstract: Virtually all species of coelomate animals contain blood cells that display a division of labor necessary for homeostasis. This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation. Yet, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.

   . Macrophages are the most plastic cells in the vertebrate's hematopoietic tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize ( Ostuni and Natoli, 2011; Wynm et al., 2013 ). Similarly, here we show that in Drosophila larvae the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate

., 2007 ). Thus, the study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled. In Drosophila melanogaster, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two different types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages ( Evans et al., 2003 )

Our motivation to carry out this work was to explain the increase of circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during Drosophila larval development. This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages ( Rizki, 1957; Lanot et al., 2001; Krzemien et al., 2010 ) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions ( Holz et al., 2003 )

. We consider that acknowledging this novel hematopoietic organ, dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis.

., 2003; Honti et al., 2010 ). Hence, in homeostatic conditions, differentiated hemocytes in the lymph gland do not contribute to the circulating and sessile hemocyte population. Nonetheless, the hemocyte population found in circulation and in sessile patches expands throughout larval development. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells ( Rizki, 1957; Lanot et al., 2001 ) expanding during larval development by self renewal ( Makhijani et al., 2011 )

., 2003 ). Crystal cells are non-phagocytic cells known to produce prophenoloxidase, an essential component of the melanization cascade ( Binggeli et al., 2014 ). Both plasmatocytes and crystal cells generated during embryogenesis persist into larval stages. Hemocytes in the larva can be found in circulation but the majority of them are attached to the cuticular epidermis as sessile cells ( Lanot et al., 2001; Kurucz et al., 2007b; Makhijani et al., 2011 )

., 2011 ). On the other hand, all reports thus far concur in that mature crystal cells do not divide during larval stages ( Krzemien et al., 2010b; Lanot et al., 2001; Rizki, 1957 ), although they have been shown to proliferate during embryogenesis ( Lebestky et al., 2000 ). Further characterization of a yet unknown source and undetermined mechanism of crystal cell differentiation is required to understand how its number increases during larval development

. Throughout time cells increase their GFP expression and become larger. Altogether our results suggest that mature plasmatocytes can differentiate into crystal cells. This conclusion may help explaining some disparate results in the literature. Firstly, circulating crystal cells in the larva derive from cells that express the plasmatocyte-specific marker croquemort during the embryonic stage ( Franc et al., 1999; Honti et al., 2010 ). Secondly, Lebestky et al

. Altogether, these results support the transdifferentiation of mature phagocytically active plasmatocytes into non-phagocytic crystal cells. As mentioned above, crystal cell numbers are reduced in larvae raised at a restrictive temperature in a thermo sensitive Notch allele background ( Duvic et al., 2002 ). This reduction is visible in sessile hemocytes and in the lymph gland ( Duvic et al., 2002; Lebestky et al., 2003 )

. The role of hemocyte clusters is most likely restricted to larval stages because, once pupariation starts, a peak of ecdysone promotes the dispersion of hemocytes throughout the epidermis ( Regan et al., 2013 ). The differentiation of crystal cells from plasmatocytes within sessile clusters creates, in our view, an interesting parallel with macrophage development in vertebrates

., 2004; Mandal et al., 2007 ). During the differentiation process, it has been suggested that cells migrate and occupy the most cortical zone of the lymph gland ( Jung et al., 2005; Krzemien et al., 2010b ). An essential aspect of the Drosophila larval hematopoiesis is that hemocytes produced in the lymph gland do not disperse from the organ until pupariation or upon injury such as parasitoid wasp egg infection ( Holz et al., 2003; Honti et al., 2010 )

. The earliest known marker predictive of crystal cell differentiation is Lozenge and it has been reported that during embryogenesis Lz+ cells can proliferate ( Lebestky et al., 2000 ). We checked whether Lz+ cells increase in number throughout third instar larval development or if their number is fixed and crystal cells mature from these precursors. We counted the total number of sessile hemocytes in the HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed LzGAL4>GFP/mCD8GFP larvae ( see ‘Materials and methods’ )

. It has been suggested repeatedly that during larval stages mature crystal cells are post-mitotic ( Rizki, 1957; Lanot et al., 2001 ) making it reasonable to assume that new crystal cells differentiate as development proceeds. This can be achieved by inducing new crystal cell precursors, proliferation of crystal cell precursors or simply by maturation of precursor cells already present in the larval body cavity

. Throughout homeostatic development, it is commonly observed, both in vertebrates ( Almeida et al., 2005 ) and invertebrates ( Rizki, 1957 ), that blood cell types respect fixed relative numbers. Also, it is now evident that plasmatocytes are very plastic cells and may represent a rare case of functionally mature cells transdifferentiating into other cell types: lamellocytes ( Honti et al., 2010 ) and crystal cells

. It is important to note, though, that hemocytes form clusters of different sizes and at different locations along the larval body ( Kurucz et al., 2007; Makhijani et al., 2011 ). Our cluster disruption procedure affects sessile hemocytes indiscriminately such that we cannot determine the relative importance of these cluster features on crystal cell differentiation.

., 2011 ). The larva also possesses a hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes ( Crozatier and Meister, 2007 ). Prohemocytes residing in the medullary zone of the lymph gland are instructed by cells from the posterior signaling center ( PSC ) to maintain their quiescent state or to differentiate into mature plasmatocytes or crystal cells ( Crozatier et al., 2004; Mandal et al., 2007 )

., 2000 ). One particularity of Notch signaling is that it requires cell contact since the two known Drosophila Notch ligands, Serrate and Delta, are membrane bound proteins ( Fiúza and Arias, 2007 ). In the lymph gland, Serrate-positive hemocytes induce neighboring cells to adopt crystal cell fates ( Lebestky et al., 2003; Hont et al. 2010 ), while Delta-positive cells induce plasocyte fate ( Lebest et al. 2003; Hont et al 2010 )

    Title: Dosage compensation can buffer copy-number variation in wild yeast
    Abstract: Aneuploidy is linked to myriad diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10–30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations—but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

   . Here, we report that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast strains, which are inherently tolerant of aneuploidy and display an active mode of gene-dosage compensation at the transcript level, for specific classes of amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation ( CNV ) and thus show elevated rates of gene amplification in natural isolates

. New mutations, through adaptation or drift, could heritably reduce expression at toxic amplified genes. Alternatively, wild strains may actively down-regulate expression in proportion to gene dose, known as dosage compensation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated isogenic aneuploid–euploid strain pairs for three wild strains

Our results provide new insight into a long-standing conundrum: how do cells tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve? Our results show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. The reduced expression is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during the adaptation to aneuploidy

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05462. 005 Given the significant phenotypic differences in laboratory vs non-laboratory aneuploid strains, we were particularly interested in the expression of amplified genes. We investigated transcript abundance relative to DNA copy for amplified genes, interrogating 2204 genes spanning eight amplified chromosomes across the six aneuploids

. While some of the Class 2a genes could be mis-classified, these results raise the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation. While the expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to gene copy, many genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation. Whole and partial chromosome amplification is common in laboratory selection experiments ( Dunham et al., 2002; Gresham et al

. To further investigate genes subject to dosage compensation, we combined Class 3a genes identified in the strain panels with genes displaying lower-than-expected expression in the isogenic aneuploid–euploid strain pairs ( Figure 4B, see ‘Materials and methods’ ), for a total of 245 genes

. To more accurately define genes subject to dosage compensation vs heritable polymorphisms, we next generated isogenic strain panels for oak strain YPS1009 and West African strain NCYC110, in which isogenic diploids carry two, three, or four copies of Chr 12 or Chr 8, respectively ( Figure 5A ). Expression in each strain within the YPS1009_Chr12 or NCYC110_Chr8 panels was normalized to a closely related euploid reference, YPS163 or NCYC3290, respectively

. 7e-4 ). Amplified genes with heritably reduced expression also showed higher buffering scores albeit lower than dosage-compensated genes ( see ‘Discussion’ ). Together, these results show that genes subject to dosage-compensated expression can be buffered against CNV in S. cerevisiae populations. The ability to buffer the toxicity of gene amplification could facilitate rapid evolution through aneuploidy

. A subset of these genes showed expression that was at least 1. 5× higher than expected, and these are annotated as magenta points in Figure 4. Genes that were differentially expressed in aneuploid vs euploid strains ( regardless of DNA abundance ) were identified with the program edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2000 ). Because of limited power for the duplicated data sets, we also included genes whose expression was greater than 1. 3X ( log2 of 0

. A substantial fraction of the genes scored in the forced YPS163 aneuploid displayed reduced expression, even though this strain had little time to adapt to the aneuploidy. Thus, dosage compensation is likely an inherent trait in S. cerevisiae that functions at a subset of yeast genes

Natural isolates are generally tolerant to aneuploidy, whether or not they have had time to adapt to the extra chromosome

This identified 838 unique genes from the six aneuploid strains whose expression was lower-than-expected per gene copy, with 111 genes amplified and affected in >1 strain

. Several studies have used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model for aneuploidy syndromes, since laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to chromosomal amplification. Laboratory strains with forced aneuploidy are extremely slow growing, regardless of the chromosome amplified ( Torres et al., 2007; Pavelka et al., 2010 ). Transcriptomic and proteomic studies in these strains reported proportionately higher expression from virtually all amplified genes ( Torres et al

Aneuploidy in laboratory strains can be advantageous under adverse conditions, when non-dosage compensated defense genes are amplified in expression ( Hughes et al., 2000; Dunham et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Yona et al., 2012 ) ; but the extent to which this occurs in nature is not known. We and others have previously shown that strains of S

. Our results raise new implications for the role of aneuploidy in phenotypic evolution and the mechanisms cells use to tolerate it.

. The lower-than-expected expression could not be explained by a general repression response to the aneuploidy, since only 39 of the 838 affected genes were part of the common response described above.

The study investigates the relationship between aneuploidy (chromosomal amplification) and dosage compensation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Anupidy is a common in wild yeast isolates, but laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to it. The researchers generated diploid panels with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes to show that dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. Anupidy provides a clear advantage to strain Y100 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The study presents a model where dosage buffers amplification through anupidy to provide a natural, likely transient route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

The researchers found that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast, which are tolerant of anupidy and display a mode of dosage compensation at the transcript level for specific classes of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage are buffered against copy-number variation (CN) and show elevated rates of amplification in isolates. Mutations through adaptation or drift could reduce expression at amplified genes, or strains actively downregulate in proportion to gene, as dosage compensation. The study generated isogenic anup-eup strain pairs for three wild strains to distinguish between these possibilities.

The results show that up to 40% of amplified in anup strains have lower-than-expected expression. The reduced expression is due to heritable polymorphisms that downregulate amplified genes, some of which may have been selected during adaptation to anupidy. The study investigated transcript abundance relative to DNA for amplified genes, interrogating 220 genes spanning amplified across six anupids. The results raise the possibility of natural variation in dosage compensation. The expression of dosage-compens genes is controlled proportion to gene, but many escape compensation in response anup and contribute to phenotyp variation.

    Title: Extraocular, rod-like photoreceptors in a flatworm express xenopsin photopigment
    Abstract: Animals detect light using opsin photopigments. Xenopsin, a recently classified subtype of opsin, challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Originally thought to belong to the Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins, xenopsins are now understood to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times, but little is known about the cells that deploy these proteins, or if they form a photopigment and drive phototransduction. We characterized xenopsin in a flatworm, Maritigrella crozieri, and found it expressed in ciliary cells of eyes in the larva, and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole ( phaosome ). Functional assays in human cells show Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi. These findings highlight similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveal a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that, like jawed vertebrate rods, encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane.

    Supporting Text:
   . In the adult we find xenopsin+, extraocular, ciliary cells and we characterize their distinct ultrastructure, revealing that, like jawed vertebrate rod photoreceptors, they enclose their cilia inside their own plasma membrane. We then carry out the first functional cellular assays on a xenopsin, exploring whether polyclad xenopsin can form a photopigment, and which classes of Gα protein it can couple to ( the first step in phototransduction cascades )

. Going beyond comparative analysis of amino acid sequences, we have provided two pieces of evidence that suggest Gαi coupling of xenopsin; primary activation of a Gαi signal transduction cascade in living human cells, and xenopsin and Gαi localization in the same putative ciliary photoreceptor in a flatworm. We have also shown xenopsin protein expression on cilia of cells that form eyes, supporting the possibility that the VxPx motif is also involved in transporting xenopsin to cilia

. The discovery of xenopsin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae challenged our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution by deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors ( Passamaneck et al., 2011; Vöcking et al., 2017 ). Xenopsin expression is both ocular and extraocular, however, either simultaneously ( e. g. in the chiton larva [Vöcking et al

. Together our findings show similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and provide the first molecular and functional evidence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms.

. Xenopsin’s ability to drive phototransduction in live human cell assays and its expression in ciliary cells in Maritigrella add molecular and functional evidence ( albeit indirect ) for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms. Metazoan ciliary photoreceptors are morphologically diverse, especially in the outer segment where the ciliary membranes increase cell surface area through membrane stacking or greater numbers of cilia, or both

. The unusual morphology, and the extraocular and extra-cerebral location of the xenopsin+ cells in the adult makes them distinct from ciliary photoreceptors in other Metazoa, and only by demonstrating a photoresponse and phototransduction in these cells in the live worms would we have direct evidence that they are ciliary photoreceptors. With this caveat in mind, however, we can compare them to ciliary photoreceptors in other animals

. In fact, xenopsin in the extra-ocular ciliary phaosomes of adult Maritigrella is yet another similarity with ciliary opsin ( which is expressed in extra-ocular CPRs of annelids and arthropods ) and is consistent with the invertebrate trend of extra-ocular ciliary photoreceptors. In Maritigrella, it is puzzling that the ciliary phaosomes in the epidermis of the larva do not express xenopsin, whilst the ciliary phaosomes in the adult do

. Our reconstructions of the opsin gene family have resolved Maritigrella genes as orthologs of xenopsins and r-opsins ( Figure 1 ), and we designated these genes as Maritigrella crozieri xenopsin ( Mc-xenopsin ) and Maritigrella crozeri rhabdomeric opsin ( Mc-r-opsin ). In the larval stage, xenopsin protein is expressed in the epidermal eye and one of the two cerebral eyes, but not in the epidermal ciliary phaosomes ( Figure 2A–C )

. Besides the Gαq expression in the r-opsin+ photoreceptors of the eyes, the only other antibody to show specific localization was Gαi, and this was expressed in the adult phaosomal cells including on the ciliary membrane ( Figure 5I and J ). The expression of xenopsin in these cells suggests that they are photoreceptors, and this would be further supported if it could be shown that xenopsin is active and can form a photopigment

., 2017 ). While the presence of xenopsins in cells with elaborated ciliary surfaces and their association with pigmented cells is strongly suggestive of a role for xenopsins in photoreception, this function has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, if xenopsins do detect light, the subsequent phototransduction pathway is unknown

. If Mc xenopsin in its native cell shows the same sustained response that we show here in mammalian cells, then perhaps these cells function to detect and amplify low levels of light, like vertebrate rods, and could be involved in detecting moonlight. The adult xenopsin+ ciliary phaosomes of Maritigrella are extraocular like the CPRs of the marine annelid Platynereis. In the annelid these are located in the brain and express a UV-sensitive ciliary opsin ( Arendt et al

. Xenopsin is co-localised with acetylated tubulin on the cilia of the cerebral eye ( Figure 2C ), showing, for the first time, xenopsin protein localization to cilia. TEM images confirm that the acTub+ cells in the epidermis of Maritigrella larvae ( Figure 2B ) are cells with multiple cilia projecting into an intracellular vacuole ( or phaosome ) ( Figure 2H ) ; although thought to be CPRs ( Lacalli, 1983; Rawlinson, 2010 ), these cells did not express xenopsin

. Our findings show that xenopsin is localized in different types of cillary cell, with different functions ( ocular and extraocular ) at different points in development, highlighting the importance of including developmental data into evolutionary scenarios on photoreceptor evolution

., 2012; Ramirez et al., 2016; Bok et al., 2017; Vöcking et al., 2017 ), and the ability to localize the mRNA transcripts and proteins of opsins in a diversity of animals has uncovered many new and morphologically divergent photosensitive cell types, both ocular and extraocular ( Vöcking et al., 2017; Bok et al., 2017 ). The recent identification of one novel group of opsins – the xenopsins ( Ramirez et al

. In Maritigrella, xenopsin was expressed in three types of ciliary cell each with distinct ciliary arrangements; the modified cilia of the larval epidermal eye, the unmodified cilia of the cerebral eye in the larva ( which project into extra-cellular space ), and the unmodified cilia enclosed in phaosomes in extraocular cells in the adult

. The presence and nature of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms is still unclear but the description of xenopsins ( but not c-opsins ) in flatworms ( Vöcking et al., 2017 ) suggests CPRs may exist. Furthermore, ultrastructural studies have identified cells with elaborated ciliary membranes - putative CPRs ( Sopott-Ehlers, 1991; Lyons, 1972; Kearn, 1993; Rohde and Watson, 1991 ) - but these have not been studied at the molecular level

. Xenopsin expression in the ciliary cells of the larval eyes is similar to expression in other larval Lophotrochozoa; the purely ciliary eye of the brachiopod ( Passamaneck et al., 2011 ), and the mixed ciliary/microvillar, xenopsin and r-opsin expressing eye in a chiton ( Vöcking et al

. The epidermal eye develops before the cerebral eyes in M. crozieri ( Rawlinson, 2010 ) and xenopsin is expressed in this eyespot during embryogenesis ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). In contrast, xenin is not expressed in the epider ciliaryosomes of the larva ( Figure 2A–C ), suggesting that the epider cilia may not be involved in photoreception in the larva. In the adult, xenin is expressed in cilia of the cerebral eye ( Figure 2D ) and in cilia of the extraocular pha ( Figure 2E–F ), but not in the epider cilia ( Figure 2G ), suggesting that the ep cilia may not be involved in photore in the adult.

    Title: Neuroblast-specific open chromatin allows the temporal transcription factor, Hunchback, to bind neuroblast-specific loci
    Abstract: Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. Drosophila progenitors ( neuroblasts ) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts ( NB5-6 and NB7-4 ) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

    Supporting Text:
   . Apart from the commonly regulated loci, we identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4. These are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. Our study, coming almost two decades after the first descriptions of spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila neural stem cells ( Isshiki et al

. Drosophila is an excellent model system to investigate how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis, due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor ( neuroblast ) lineages, and the molecular mechanisms involved in both spatial and temporal patterning during neurogenesis

. While both scenarios would result in the specification of distinct neural identities in spatially distinct NBs, in the independent specification model, TTF binding will be identical in all neuroblasts whereas in the sequential specification model, TTF binding will occur at different loci in each neuroblast. To discriminate between these models, we sought to determine Hb genomic targets in NB5-6 versus NB7-4

. It is clear that spatial and temporal cues are integrated to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity, both in Drosophila embryonic neuroblasts and optic lobe neuroblasts ( Erclik et al., 2017 ), and likely in mammalian progenitor lineages. Yet in no case, mammals or Drosophila, is it known how spatial and TTFs are integrated. Here we hypothesise two mechanisms by which this integration could occur. ( 1 ) Independent specification ( Figure 1B )

. In both Drosophila and mammals, this process appears to be regulated, in part, by temporal transcription factors ( TTFs ) that are sequentially expressed within individual neural progenitors ( Kohwi and Doe, 2013 )

. The ability to query transcription factor occupancy in such a precise manner – in a small subsets of cells over short periods of time – will encourage new uses of the method, such as studying the determination of cellular identities during development, upon reprogramming, or even in response to stimuli. We propose that the spatial factor Gsb opens genomic loci in NB5-6, allowing the temporal factor Hb to bind loci that are not available in the adjacent Gsb-negative NB7-4

. We demonstrate that Hb has differential targets in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages, which correspond to differentially open chromatin in each lineage. Importantly, our observation that Hb-bound loci specific to NB5-6 have open chromatin, but the same loci in NB7-4 have closed chromatin, shows that Hb is not sufficient to create open chromatin. Rather, Hb binding in each neuroblast is likely restricted to a subset of neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains

. Spatial patterning factors that specify neuroblast identity have been characterized, and all of them are transcription factors or signalling pathways with transcription factor effectors. Henceforth we refer to these spatial factors as ‘spatial transcription factors’ or STFs, paralleling the naming of temporal transcription factors as TTFs

., 2013 ). Hb can induce first-born neuronal identity at any point during this competence window, showing that Hb binding sites are accessible throughout the competence window; this is important to consider for the experiments described here, where we have restricted our Hb binding and chromatin accessibility profiling experiments to the stage 9–12 competence window in individual neuroblast lineages ( see below )

. This clearly rules out the independent specification model where Hb has identical binding sites in different neuroblasts. We next wanted to understand how STFs might influence TTF genomic binding. Given the order of their action – STFs acting early in the neuroectoderm, and TTFs acting later in the delaminated NB – one possibility is that STFs generate different open/closed chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast such that TTFs have access to different loci in each neuroblast

. If independent specification is used, we expect to find similar Hb occupancy in each neuroblast ( Figure 1B ), whereas if sequential specification is used, we expect to find different Hb genomic binding in each neuroblast ( Figure 1C ). Our goal was to identify Hb occupancy within the early NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages during the Hb competence window, when Hb retains the ability to generate ectopic early-born neuronal identities, and thus presumably can still bind its normal genomic targets

. In support of this model, the Gsb STF, required to specify NB5-6 but not NB7-4, shows enriched occupancy at open chromatin and Hb enriched loci in NB5-6, but not in NB7-4, consistent with a role for Gsb in generating neuroblast-specific open chromatin organization. Our findings support a sequential specification model in which STFs create neuroblast-specific chromatin organization, leading to neuroblast-specific Hb DNA-binding.

. Ideally, similar experiments need to be conducted with Dam:Gsb in NB5-6 and Dam:En in NB7-4 lineage to determine correspondence of STF occupancy and chromatin accessibility, as well as STF and TTF occupancy in the NB lineages. The advantage of the Drosophila model is that these relationships can be rigorously tested

., 2013 ). Importantly, each TTF specifies a different type of neuron in each neuroblast lineage, showing that spatial identity provides a different context for Hb function in each neuroblast ( Figure 1A, right ). Understanding this ‘context’ at a mechanistic level is the goal of our experiments below. The role of TTFs is best exemplified by Hb, the first TTF in the cascade

., 2001 ), has for the first time explored the mechanism by which spatial and temporal factors could be integrated to generate neuroblast-specific neuronal progeny. Only recently has it been possible to probe TTF DNA-binding and chromatin landscapes within two distinct neuroblast lineages – due to the parallel advances in genetic tools, functional genomics, and our ability to manipulate the genome

. Although we have provided evidence that Hb-bound loci are chosen from neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, this does not rule out that sequential specification occurs via lineage-specific STFs/STF-target genes acting as Hb cofactors to bias Hb binding in each lineage. However, we have been unable to find any de novo DNA motif enriched within 1 kb of Hb-bound loci throughout the genome, either neuroblast-specific loci or within all Hb-bound loci

. Although a great deal is known about how spatial factors generate regional diversity, and much has recently been learned about temporal patterning mechanisms, virtually nothing is known about how spatial factors and TTFs are integrated to specify distinct neuronal identities in spatially distinct progenitor populations

. We expected the number of differentially bound loci to be relatively small, because most genes are not predicted to regulate NB5-6/NB7-4 differences, and indeed, comparing Hb binding along the entire fourth chromosome shows qualitative similarities between the two NB lineages ( Figure 4B ). This is also evident at genes known to be expressed in and regulated by Hb across many neuroblast lineages – for example Kr, pdm2 and zfh2 ( Isshiki et al., 2001 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )

. All but two of these differentially bound loci were also identified in the differential chromatin analysis; even the two that were not picked up in the analysis ( sqz and mspo ) were qualitatively different between the two neuroblast lineages ( Figure 6D, E ). We conclude that neuroblast-specific Dam:Hb binding occurs within neuroblast-specific accessible chromatin domains. This correlation suggests that either Hb binds where chromatin is open, or that Hb binding opens chromatin

. We do not favor the latter mechanism because Hb binds some sites in NB5-6 but not in NB7-4 ( and vice versa ) showing that it is not sufficient to open chromatin. NB5-6 and NB7-4 develop adjacent to each other during neuroblast stage 9–12, and both have the same chromatin accessibility profile ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), ruling out the possibility that Hb opens chrom in NB-6 but not NB-7, or vice versa.

    Title: Photo-switchable tweezers illuminate pore-opening motions of an ATP-gated P2X ion channel
    Abstract: P2X receptors function by opening a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP. Recent crystal structures solved in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening still remains controversial. Here we use photo-switchable cross-linkers as ‘molecular tweezers’ to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.

    In this study, we report on the use of molecular photo-switchable tweezers in conjunction with MD simulations to explore the function of a trimeric ion channel. We show that a vertical decrease of the distance separating the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining TM2 helices, likely through bending at a critical ‘gating hinge’, is essential for activation of the P2X2 receptor

., 2014 ) have shown that breaking of one TM2-TM2 interface is sufficient for gating. As there is no evidence that this movement alters the sensitivity for ATP, the light-induced outward expansion of a single TM2-TM2 interface is likely a local rearrangement of the TMD. In conclusion, this study provides the first application of photo-switchable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P2X receptors

., 2004; Allsopp and Evans, 2011; Robinson and Murrell-Lagnado, 2013 ), may distort somewhat the structure of the pore, raising the possibility that the X-ray structure may represent a non-native, open-channel state. Hence, additional data are needed to understand the gating mechanism of a full-length, membrane-embedded P2X receptor

. In this study, we present a new chemical-based method to explore the gating motion of the rat P2X2 ( rP2X2 ) receptor by cross-linking engineered cysteine residues in the TMD with photo-switchable azobenzene tweezers, for which the end-to-end distance can be controlled by light. A set of structural constraints combined with Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) provided high-resolution models of the channel both in the open and closed states in their physiological environment

. By contrast, a 2. 4-fold decrease of ATP sensitivity was observed for the G342A mutant, which is consistent with the fact that alanine residue rigidifies α-helices. These data demonstrate that TM2 helices in the P2X2 receptor contain a critical ‘hinge’, which facilitates their vertical bending, allowing the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer during activation. 10. 7554/eLife. 11050. 027Figure 6

. Although NMDG permeability was insignificant in one case ( horizontal cross-linking ) and partial in the other ( vertical cross-linking ), our data support the idea that the P2X pore fluctuates between distinct open conformations, and that these photo-switchable tweezers may be useful to investigate the controversial molecular mechanism of pore dilation

., 2014; Reiner and Isacoff, 2014 ). Therefore, the photo-switchable tweezers strategy presented here is distinct from the optogating approach described previously ( Lemoine et al., 2013 ), and provides distance restraints related to gating at physiological conditions. Introducing them as input in MD studies of P2X receptors allowed us to stabilize the open-channel state for the first time in simulation

First, the proposed mechanism of gating implies a great radial outward movement of the TM helices away from the threefold axis, which creates large ‘crevices’ between the TM helices of adjacent subunits

., 2010 ). Models of the P2X trimers with or without attached MAM photo-switchable tweezers were produced starting from the crystal structures of the zfP2X4 receptor in the apo, closed-channel ( PDB ID: 4DW0 ) and ATP-bound, open-channel ( 4DW1 ) states ( Hattori and Gouaux, 2012 ). Unresolved side chains were modeled in CHARMM ( Brooks et al

. Given that ATP is a partial agonist on the rP2X2 receptor ( Ding and Sachs, 1999 ), this suggests that MAM-induced motions are functionally linked to ATP function ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E and Figure 1—source data 2 ). Fifth, we found that light-gated channels remained selective to cations ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) and showed calcium permeability that was somewhat lower ( by 1. 6-fold ) than that of the ATP-gated P2X2-3T ( Figure 2B and Figure 2—source data 2 ) ( Lemoine et al

The β-atoms of residues selected for cysteine substitutions are shown as yellow spheres. Indicated values are the average distances separating pairwise β-atoms from two adjacent TM2 helices ( grey bridges )

. Most importantly, we found that light-induced motions of the TMD positively modulate ATP function, thus indicating an efficient crosstalk between the ion pore and the distant neurotransmitter-binding sites, a mechanism that is reminiscent of the action of positive allosteric modulators. It remains to be determined, however, whether or not pathways elicited by light that lead to channel opening and closing are similar to those triggered by ATP

. Control experiments showed that the main conductance state ( O ) of channels opened by ATP in patches excised from cells expressing the P2X2-3T channel was somewhat higher than that previously determined for the WT P2X2 receptor ( Jiang et al., 2011; Rothwell et al., 2014 )

. The first main finding of this study is a set of interatomic distances probed within the TMD both in the resting and the active state of the receptor ( Figure 5A and B ). Our data confirm the lateral expansion of the outer ends of the TM helices ( Li et al., 2008; 2010 ), which was observed in the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state ( Hattori and Gouaux, 2012 ), and functionally probed recently by the shorter photo-linker 4, 4´-bis ( maleimido ) azobenzene ( BMA ) ( Browne et al

. By incorporating photo-switchable tweezers at engineered sites at the outer ends ( horizontal cross-linking ) or between the inner and outer ends ( vertical cross-linking ) of adjacent TM2 helices, we demonstrate that these tools can be used as molecular rulers to probe structural changes involved in activation. The versatility of the strategy makes it a promising approach for dissecting the allosteric mechanisms of other membrane proteins.

We hypothesized that bending of TM2 helices around this glycine would facilitate the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer together in the open state. To test this assumption, we mutated this residue to alanine ( G342A ) or proline ( G4 ) in the TMD of the P2X2 receptor. The G342A mutant showed a 2.4 -fold decrease in sensitivity to ATP ( Figure 6A and Figure—source 1 ), consistent with the rigidification of TM2 helices by alanine. In contrast, the G4 mutant showed no change in sensitivity to ATP ( Figure 6 and Figure—source 1 ), suggesting that proline does not significantly alter the structure of TM2 helices. These data support the idea that TM2 helices in the P2 receptor contain a critical hinge that facilitates their bending during activation

The main finding of this study is that photoable tweez can be used as molecular tweez to monitor structural changes in the transmembrane domain of the P2 receptor during activation. Our data show that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2 receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.

    Title: Cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms promote cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity
    Abstract: Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, is powered by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It has long been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, but growing evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin ( F-actin ) cytoskeleton. In one cell ( P2 ), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell ( EMS ) this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.

    Here, we used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis. We found that, similar to in the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al

. In contrast, formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos again showed cell type variation in the temporal requirement for activity among individual blastomeres. In our previous analysis of the one-cell C. elegans embryo, cytokinesis failed 100% of the time with forminCYK-1 inactivation by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature at any time before mid-ring constriction ( Davies et al., 2014 )

. elegans embryo. We used fast-acting temperature-sensitive ( ts ) alleles to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction in the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010 ) : the motor myosin-II ( NMY-2 in C. elegans, hereafter myosin-IINMY-2 ) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1 ( hereafter forminCYK-1 ). We identified cell-type-specific variation in four-cell embryos in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2

. Together, our data show that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo

. Therefore, in the four-cell C. elegans embryo, each cell has a unique cell identity and can be individually scored for contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis. To study the mechanisms of cytokinetic variation, we combined thermogenetics with cell type-specific in vivo and ex vivo analysis of cytokinesis in each blastomere of the four-cell C. elegans embryo

. In formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos at restrictive temperature ( 26°C ), F-actin was still present at the cell-cell junctions but was not enriched at the contractile ring during cell division in any of the four blastomeres, including in EMS and P2 cells that successfully completed cytokinesis ( Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 ). It is important to note that these C

. Taken together, our functional and temporal requirement analysis suggests that differences in forminCYK-1-mediated actin dynamics may underlie cell-type-based cytokinetic diversity. In animal cells, diaphanous family formin-mediated assembly of linear F-actin during cytokinesis is thought to be essential for the assembly and constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring ( D'Avino et al., 2015; Pollard, 2010; Severson et al., 2002; Bohnert et al., 2013 )

. If multiple formin-related proteins function together to promote contractile ring assembly in EMS and P2 when forminCYK-1 activity is reduced, then F-actin at the division plane should remain at high levels in these cells upon temperature upshift in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant embryos. This outcome would also be predicted if stable, pre-existing F-actin filaments, rather than de novo forminCYK-1-nucleated filaments, comprise the contractile ring during cytokinesis in EMS and P2

We first sought to identify variation in the regulation of cytokinesis in individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo ( Figure 1A ). To do this, we took a thermogenetic approach and used fast-acting ts alleles to weaken the contractile ring, while monitoring differences in cytokinesis between ABa, ABp, EMS, and P2 at increasing temperatures by spinning disc confocal microscopy

., 2002; Bohnert et al., 2013 ). ForminCYK-1 is the only worm diaphanous family formin ( Pruyne, 2016 ). In formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant one-cell C. elegans embryos at 16°C, F-actin is present in the contractile ring ( although at lower levels than in control embryos ) but, upon upshift to 26°C, linear F-actin is no longer visible and cytokinesis fails ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and [Davies et al., 2014] )

. Instead, it suggests cell-type-specific mechanism ( s ) allow cytokinesis to occur in the absence of a robust F-actin cytoskeleton in these blastomeres

. Thus, the extrinsic mechanism protecting EMS cells from cytokinesis failure after inhibition of formincyk-1 is dependent on SrcSRC-1 signaling from P2 cells. Together, our data demonstrate that both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms modulate cytokinesis in individual blastomeres in the absence of robust F-actin levels in the contractile ring.

. In contrast, we found that EMS is protected against cytokinesis failure by extrinsic regulation due to direct cell-cell contact with P2 and SrcSRC-1 mediated cell-fate signaling. This work establishes the early C. elegans four-cell embryo as a system to study cytokinetic diversity and suggests that, at least in the early C. elegans embryo, both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity

. It is important to note that these C. elegans F-actin reporters are dim, even in control embryos; thus, our inability to detect F-actin on our microscope system with these reporters does not indicate an absence of F-actin in the contractile ring

. Indeed, myosinNMY-2 is still essential for cytokinesis in EMS and P2, indicating a ‘normal’ constricting actomyosin contractile ring is likely driving division in these blastomeres. Nonetheless, it is clear that, unlike one-cell embryos and ABa/ABp cells, EMS and P2 blastomeres are still somehow able to divide successfully with a substantially weakened F-actin contractile ring, whether weakened by inhibition of forminCYK-1 or application of low doses of Latrunculin A

. elegans embryo. Due to the similarities between cell fate signaling and cytokinetic machinery between worms and humans, we predict that similar regulation contributes to cytokinetic variation within cells of the human body to promote sensitivity or resistance to cytokinesis failure and therefore potentially mediate the onset or prevention of cell-type-specific pathologies.

., 2016 ). To test if other formin-related proteins could compensate for loss of forminCYK-1 activity during cytokinesis in EMS and P2, we depleted the six other C. elegans formin-related proteins by RNAi in formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutants and monitored the success or failure of cytokinesis in the four-cell embryo

. To determine if robust cytokinesis in EMS and P2 could also withstand perturbations of the F-actin cytoskeleton independent of forminCYK-1 activity, we next tested whether cytokinesis in EMS and P2 is resistant to pharmacological inhibition of F-actin polymerization by treatment with low doses of the F-actin inhibitor, LatrunculinA ( LatA ). Embryos were first permeabilized by perm-1 ( RNAi ), a gene required for normal eggshell assembly ( Carvalho et al., 2011; Olson et al., 2012 )

. Robust cytokinesis in P2 is cell-intrinsically regulated and independent of contact with other blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. In contrast, robust cytokinesis in EMS is extrinsically regulated dependent on contact with P and Src-1 mediated cell signaling.

    Title: A model symbiosis reveals a role for sheathed-flagellum rotation in the release of immunogenic lipopolysaccharide
    Abstract: Bacterial flagella mediate host–microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization, as well as by activating immune responses. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this unusual structural feature has remained an enigma. Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist Vibrio fischeri and the pathogen Vibrio cholerae promotes release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide, found in the flagellar sheath. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function.

    Supporting Text:
    Using the model squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the rotation of sheathed flagella in mediating the release of the immunogenic molecule LPS in both V. fischeri and its pathogenic congener V. cholerae. The flagellar sheath has proved problematic to study; indeed, to our knowledge, there are no mutations that result in the loss of a sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella

. Thus, the functional role of the sheath, even as it relates to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized, and observation of this new phenomenon for the flagellar sheath furthers our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence

. Further work will build upon these discoveries and clarify the mechanisms underlying signaling during initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis; such work includes characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS ( Goodson et al., 2005; Krasity et al., 2011 ), and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses. While thus far demonstrated only in V

Reports of flagellar-mediated activation of immunity have thus far been limited to responses to the filament protein, flagellin ( Hayashi et al., 2001; Franchi et al., 2006 ). Despite the flagellar sheath, flagellin monomers are a prevalent component of the secretome of both V. cholerae ( Xicohtencatl-Cortes et al., 2006 ) and V

? As the tools with which to study the flagellar sheath are limited, we sought to use the model symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, in which the events of initial colonization can be observed in real-time, to probe whether the sheathed flagellum plays a role in inducing a symbiont-specific host response

., 2011 ), may similarly release the immunogenic molecule LPS during flagellar rotation and, thereby, regulate immune recognition during infection. However, the complexity of mammalian models of host–microbe interactions can limit efforts to separate the various contributions of flagellar motility, and highlights the role of invertebrate model systems in revealing the underlying principles that govern shared mechanisms of host–microbe interactions.

., 2000 ). Further, by activating the squid’s developmental program in response to symbiont exposure, the flagellar sheath may serve to promote recognition by the host immune system, suggesting the context-dependent nature ( mutualism or pathogenesis ) of this behavior. Perhaps masking one immunostimulatory molecule ( e. g., flagellin ) with another ( e. g., LPS ) can serve to modulate, rather than simply avoid ( Gewirtz et al

Bacterial flagella are important virulence factors that facilitate tissue tropism in host–microbe interactions. Besides mediating such migration, flagella serve additional functions, such as adherence to or invasion of host cells ( Young et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2001; Giron et al., 2002 )

. As in V. fischeri, disruption of flagellar rotation in V. cholerae significantly reduced LPS release ( Figure 5A ), supporting the conclusion that this mechanism of LPS release is not unique to V. fischeri, but is conserved among bacteria with sheathed flagella

. Intriguingly, a few Vibrio species, including the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus, encode two independent flagellar structures: one set producing sheathed, the other unsheathed flagella ( McCarter, 1999 ). However, pleiotropic effects of mutations in these distinct pathways as well as other technical limitations make a direct comparison of unsheathed and sheathed flagella within this species difficult to interpret ( L McCarter, personal communication )

. This hypothesized role for the flagellar sheath presents a conundrum: what is the effect of coating a rapidly spinning structure with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), another potent immunostimulatory molecule

. The biological function ( s ) of the sheath remains unknown, but it has been posited to allow these bacteria to evade innate immune recognition of the enclosed flagellins ( Gewirtz et al., 2004; Yoon and Mekalanos, 2008 )

. While thus far demonstrated only in V. fischeri and V. cholerae, the phenomenon of flagellar-mediated LPS release may be conserved across other animal-associated bacteria with sheathed flagella. The human pathogens Brucella melitensis and Helicobacter pylori, whose sheathed flagellum and/or flagellar motility serve as important virulence factors ( Ottemann and Lowenthal, 2002; Petersen et al

., 2001; Giron et al., 2002 ). However, in most vertebrate models of pathogenesis, it has been difficult to separate the distinct contribution of flagellar motility in bacterial migration from its other roles, such as immune-system activation ( Feuillet et al., 2006; Andersen-Nissen et al., 2007 ). Bacterial flagella are highly conserved on a molecular level, but display diversity in morphology, number and subcellular localization between species

. The motX mutant was grown to mid-log phase in SWT broth, and visualized by negative-stain TEM, revealing normal sheathed flagella. Scale bar indicates 1 µm. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01579. 016 Finally, we asked whether flagellar rotation-mediated LPS release is characteristic of other bacteria with sheathed flagella by comparing the amount of LPS shed by wild-type Vibrio cholerae O395N1 and its amotile motAB-deletion derivative. As in V

. Such images are indicative of weaknesses between the flagellar sheath and shaft, which may be analogous to the foci of disassociation between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan required for the formation of cell-derived outer-membrane vesicles ( OMVs ) ( McBroom and Kuehn, 2007 ). Thus, rotation of the flagellum would further destabilize these interactions, likely releasing LPS and activating an LPS-dependent immune response, rather than simply shielding against a host response. 10

. One such variation is the presence of an outer membrane-derived sheath ( Fuerst and Perry, 1988; Geis et al., 1993; Ferooz and Letesson, 2010 ). While the flagella of most bacteria are unsheathed, such a structure surrounds the filament of several polarly flagellated bacteria, including several with a host-associated lifestyle

. Because the actual location at which amotile mutants are arrested in symbiotic initiation has not been defined, we confirmed that both the location and number ( Figure 1G, H ) of bacteria at this early stage were indistinguishable in squid exposed to wild-type, flrA or motB1 cells. These data show that flagellar motility plays a role in inducing a specific host immune response that is independent of its later role in migration into the light-organ crypts ( Brennan et al

. As this behavior is difficult to probe experimentally, novel approaches, such as the modeling of the biophysical properties underlying lipid-membrane behavior at a sub-micron scale, are needed to inform our understanding of the interactions between the sheath and filament along the length of the flagellum, as well as the physical forces at play between a rotating flagellar sheath and the contiguous, but static, cellular outer membrane

To address whether the sheathed flagellum mediates symbiont recognition, we first compared the appearance of apoptosis within the host’s ciliated epithelium ( Figure 1A ) in response to inoculation with either wild-type V. fischer or its flA mot1 mutant.

    Title: Catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants
    Abstract: Genome instability is associated with mitotic errors and cancer. This phenomenon can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and many questions regarding its genesis, fate and evolutionary role remain unanswered. Here, we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Lastly, heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable, natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders.

   . These have never been described in Arabidopsis before, possibly because, if they were to arise from meiotic defects, they would result from nullisomic gametes, which are not viable ( Henry et al., 2009 ). Aneuploids resulting from mitotic failure do not have those constraints. 10. 7554/eLife. 06516. 003Figure 1. Ploidy types resulting from centromere-mediated uniparental genome elimination. The altered CENH3 ‘GFP-tailswap’ strain was hybridized to the recessive glabrous1-1 mutant

Taken together, our results provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring ( Cai et al., 2014; Morrison et al., 2014 ) when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon studied here depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species ( Maheshwari et al

. In addition, our results obtained using DNA ligase4-2 mutants suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny, such that when NHEJ is inhibited, haploid induction frequency increased. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 06516. 017 Our in silico reconstruction suggests that NHEJ is involved in repairing breaks that occurred on the shattered chromosomes

. This result indicates that NHEJ contributes to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination ( Wang et al., 2014 ). We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued ( i. e

. The consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity can be dire ( McClintock, 1984; Gordon et al., 2012 ). Missegregated chromosomes can lead to aneuploidy ( Janssen et al., 2011 ), but also to extensive and catastrophic restructuring resulting in, sequentially, chromosome sequestration in micronuclei, endonucleolytic damage, defective repair, and finally rescue ( Crasta et al., 2012; Hatch et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013 )

., 2003 ). It is possible that pathways leading to disease and to diversity share a common mechanistic basis ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Genome elimination in Arabidopsis provides a previously lacking organismal system to investigate genome instability during mitotic catastrophes, connected mechanisms, and consequences.

. 001 ). The presence of micronuclei suggests that sub-compartmentalized lagging chromosomes can be shattered by double stranded DNA breaks, reassembled haphazardly by non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ), and finally restituted into the main nucleus ( Crasta et al., 2012 ). In order to reconstruct breakpoint junctions, we sequenced FRAG00062 to 100× coverage, extracted read pairs from the ends of duplicated and triplicated blocks and performed de novo assembly

. This allowed us to distinguish the haploid inducer Chr1, the Ler Chr1, and a third Chr1 with rearranged signals, which we interpret as the shattered extranumerary chromosome ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). During meiotic Metaphase I ( Figure 4D ) or other meiotic stages observed from male meiocytes ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ), the shattered chromosome does not pair with the parental Chr1s. 10. 7554/eLife. 06516. 011Figure 4

. In many cases, the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3 missegregate in the embryo and are compartmentalized in micronuclei. DNA damage, NHEJ repair and restitution of the micronucleus to the euploid pole nucleus can result in aneuploidy or diploidy. Alternatively, shattered chromosomes result from chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis. The former involves fragmentation and random ligation, the latter replication fork collapse and microhomology-mediated strand switching

. Based on these results, we believe that truncated and shattered aneuploid classes from our crosses reflect genomic instability associated with mitotic errors in the early embryo. Shattered chromosomes can be recovered from all five A. thaliana chromosomes ( Figure 3A )

., 2015 ), indicating the effectiveness of natural and artificial variation. While the genesis and fate of restructured chromosomes is difficult to study in humans, their formation, effects, and even transmission in Arabidopsis are within experimental reach, as demonstrated by the enhancing effect of NHEJ mutants on haploid induction

. To address this question, we asked whether breakpoint junctions of the two different copy number states display differential association to various genomic and chromatin features such as genes and repeated elements ( Lamesch et al., 2012 ), DNA replication origins ( Costas et al., 2011 ), DNase I hypersensitive sites ( DHS ) ( Zhang et al., 2012 ) and nine non-overlapping chromatin states that partition the Arabidopsis genome ( Sequeira-Mendes et al

. 5%, p < 0. 05, Figure 5E, G ). The association of the breakpoints flanking duplicated DNA to genic DNA and of those flanking triplicated DNA to replication origins suggests the contribution of two distinct mechanisms to restructuring of the same chromosome ( Figure 6 ). The first, chromothripsis acting through breakage and ligation ( Stephens et al., 2011; Korbel and Campbell, 2013 )

., 2011; Korbel and Campbell, 2013 ). The second, chromoanasynthesis, via replication fork collapse and template switching ( Hastings et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011; Kloosterman and Cuppen, 2013 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 06516. 017Figure 6. The process of genome elimination and connected models for chromosomal rearrangements. Genome elimination ensues when a haploid inducer expressing a variant CENH3 protein mates with the wild type

., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013 ). The resulting structurally rearranged chromosomes may contribute to cancer or developmental syndromes ( Hastings et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2011; Jones and Jallepalli, 2012 ). Nevertheless, chromosomal rearrangements are not necessarily deleterious: some may influence fitness by altering recombination or gene dosage ( Comai et al., 2003 )

. This may be explained by the uneven distribution between chromosomes of few, selected genes that are highly dosage-sensitive. According to this hypothesis, Chr4 would be selectively depleted for such genes. Chromosomal truncations have been reported from a selfed trisomic ( Huettel et al., 2008 ). To assess whether truncated and shattered aneuploid types could be produced from meiotic missegregation, we sequenced 96 individuals produced by a selfed Col-0 triploid

Nucleosomes containing variant histone ( centromeric histone H3, CENH3 ) ( Verda et al. 2013 ) were expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These plants were hybridized with a recessive glrous-1 mutant ( gl-1 ) to produce aneuploid progeny ( Figure 1 ). The aneup progeny were haploid or diploid ( Figure 2 ) and contained shattered chromosomes ( Figure 3 ). The shattered chromosomes were formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lard compartmentalized within micronucle ( Figure 4 ). Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining ( NHE ) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery ( Figure 5 ). Heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

The article discusses the phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, specifically in Arabidopsis thaliana, where hybridization of plants expressing centromeric histone H3 (CH) leads to the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosome compartmental within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, and heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty. The study provides a tractable natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

Here is a summary of the key points:

* Catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome in plants has been observed in Arabidopsis thalian, where hybridization of plants expressing centrom histone H3 (CH) leads to formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of haploid inducer.
* The shattered chromosomes are consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosomeal compartment within micronucle.

    Title: Epstein-Barr virus ensures B cell survival by uniquely modulating apoptosis at early and late times after infection
    Abstract: Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers. EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription. Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 ( Pegman et al., 2006 ) as well as LMP1-induced NFκB ( Pratt et al., 2012 )

. In our BH3 profiling study, we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1, followed by BFL-1. Mechanistically, we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation

. Therefore, uninfected human peripheral blood CD19+ B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival and EBV upregulates additional survival proteins to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism. Our BH3 profiling experiments predicted that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells ( Figure 1E )

. Rather, constitutive NFκB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1, a TNFR homologue, is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected, proliferating cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000; Pratt et al., 2012 ). However, the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors ( EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP ) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NFκB activity ( Price et al., 2012 )

., 2013 ). Therefore, the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis. The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb ( Price and Luftig, 2015 )

., 2000; Zimber-Strobl and Strobl, 2001 ). EBNA2 also activates the expression of the viral oncoprotein LMP1, which drives the immortalization of the infected B cell into a lymphoblastoid cell line, or LCL, that proliferates indefinitely in culture. Together, the EBV latent oncoproteins mimic key aspects of normal B cell biology, promote proliferation, and inhibit the host innate tumor suppressor response to uncontrolled proliferation ( Allday, 2013; Price and Luftig, 2014 )

Suppression of apoptosis by EBV is essential for establishment of latent infection in the immune-competent host and promotes tumorigenesis in the immune suppressed host. While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues, these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005 )

., 2012 ). Furthermore, this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response, which would be expected to promote apoptosis ( Nikitin et al., 2010 ). We, therefore, sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs

., 2010 ). Similarly, the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005 ). In addition, expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression ( Paschos et al., 2009; Skalska et al., 2013 ), thereby making infected cells less ‘primed’ for apoptosis

. Therefore, we conclude that EBNA3A plays an important role in EBV-mediated resistance to BCL-2 antagonists and survival in response to potent proliferative signals during both early and late stages of B cell growth transformation.

. To functionally characterize EBV-regulated survival, we first analyzed BCL-2 family member mRNA expression through B cell outgrowth. We observed that MCL-1 mRNA increased from uninfected B to EBV-infected and proliferating B cells and was further increased in LCLs ( Figure 3A ). Over the same infection time course, both BCL-2 and BFL-1 were initially downregulated in early proliferating B cells relative to uninfected B cells, then upregulated during LCL outgrowth

Previously, our laboratory has identified an early period after EBV infection of primary human B cells where, despite robust virus-mediated proliferation and activation of the pro-apoptotic DNA damage response, there is little expression of the key viral survival factor LMP1 ( Price et al., 2012 )

. These data support the hypothesis defined by our BH3 profiling data that LCLs depend on BFL-1, MCL-1, and BCL-2 to protect from apoptosis induced by viral oncoprotein-driven proliferation. A hallmark of B cell biology is rapid proliferation in response to antigen and cytokines leading to maturation via germinal center reactions into the memory and plasma cell lineages ( Goodnow et al., 2010 )

. In this study, we characterized the BH3 profile of uninfected and EBV-infected primary human B cells from early proliferation through long-term outgrowth. We validated these profiles using BH3 mimetics and, importantly, identified a novel virus-specific transition in survival mechanisms between early and late stages of latent infection with implications for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies.

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22509. 012 We hypothesized that selective inhibition of MCL-1 should render early proliferating cells, but not LCLs, sensitive to drugs that target BCL-2, namely ABT-737 and the BCL-2 specific inhibitor ABT-199. Treatment of EBV-infected proliferating B cells at 7dpi or LCLs with either ABT-737, ABT-199, or a specific MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477 ( A-1210 ) induced minimal apoptosis ( Figure 3D–E )

., 2012 ). Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NFκB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription. Therefore, our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A, EBNA2, and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival

. 7554/eLife. 22509. 014Figure 4—source data 1. Source data for cell counts and apoptotic assays of uninfected, mitogen-stimulated B cells. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22509. 014 EBV requires expression of protein products from the heavily spliced Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen ( EBNA ) transcriptional unit to promote B cell proliferation and survival ( Price and Luftig, 2014 )

., 2014 ) ( Figure 6I ). These data support an important new role for EBNA3A in coordinating NFκB-mediated regulation of BFL-1 transcription in LCLs. Finally, to demonstrate that EBNA3A is responsible for ABT-737 resistance in EBV-infected B cells, we rescued EBNA3A expression in trans in △3A LCLs. We found that EBNA3A re-expression was sufficient to restore ABT-737 resistance similar to WT LCLs ( Figure 7 )

    Title: Genetic variation, environment and demography intersect to shape Arabidopsis defense metabolite variation across Europe
    Abstract: Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with the challenges presented by complex and ever-changing environments. These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, we are just beginning to understand how frequently new alleles arise controlling specialized metabolite diversity and how the geographic distribution of these alleles may be structured by ecological and demographic pressures. Here, we measure the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We show that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This showed that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence. This provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.

    Supporting Text:
   . The potential for these genetic variants influencing plant chemical variation is derived from the enhanced proportion of gene duplication in enzyme encoding genes for specialized metabolism, both at the local and whole genome level ( Kliebenstein et al., 2001c; Moghe and Last, 2015 ). Many mechanistic studies of natural variation in specialized metabolism have focused on biallelic phenotypic variation linked to loss-of-function variants

., 2019; Yamada et al., 2003 ). The Arabidopsis-GSL system is an optimal model to study the species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation because the identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway is known, including the major causal loci for natural variation ( Benderoth et al., 2006; Brachi et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2007; Kliebenstein et al., 2001a; Kliebenstein et al., 2002b; Kliebenstein et al

. This level of allelic diversity at these loci raises a question of how do pathways with this level of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries ( Figure 5—figure supplement 4 ). Confounding this further is the observation that Brassica ssp. have genetic variation at GS-Elong and GS-AOP creating the exact same chemotypic variation found in Arabidopsis ( Heidel et al., 2006; Ramos-Onsins et al., 2004; Windsor et al., 2005 )

Understanding the genetic, demographic and environmental factors that shape variation within a trait in a population is key to understanding trait evolution. In this work, we used a family of specialized metabolites, aliphatic GSLs, and measured their amounts in seeds of A. thaliana to query how genetics, geography, environment and demography intersect to shape chemotypic variation across Europe

. Thus, it is necessary to understand how the intersection of environmental pressure, demography and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species. To better understand how genomic variation, demography and environmental pressure shape the variation of specialized metabolism within a species, we used the Arabidopsis glucosinolate ( GSL ) pathway as a model

? We focus on the GS-AOP, GS-Elong and GS-OH loci, the causal genes creating Arabidopsis GSL chemotypes, and use the available genomic sequences in all these accessions to investigate the allelic variation in these genes to map the allelic distribution and test the potential for convergent and/or parallel evolution within each locus

. Integrating these offsetting effects across dynamic environments involves multiple selective pressures that might contribute to shaping the genetic and metabolic variation within a species ( Fan et al., 2019; Kerwin et al., 2015; Malcolm, 1994; Sønderby et al., 2010; Szakiel et al., 2011; Wentzell and Kliebenstein, 2008; Züst et al., 2012 ). Significant advances have been made in recent decades to identify genetic sources contributing to metabolic variation

Continuous and dynamic change in a plant’s habitat/environment creates a complex system to which a plant must adapt. Central to this adaptation are the production and accumulation of different metabolites ranging from signaling hormones, primary metabolites to a wide array of multi-functional specialized metabolites ( Erb and Kliebenstein, 2020; Hanower and Brzozowska, 1975; Hayat et al., 2012; Kim et al

. By combining GSL seed measurements with prior whole-genome sequencing in a European collection of accessions, we show that all three major causal loci controlling GSL metabolic diversity contain multiple independently derived alleles that recreate the same phenotypes using a combination of single nucleotide polimorphism ( SNPs ) and structural variation

. A common finding of these studies is that the metabolic variation within and between species is the result of structural variation at the enzymes responsible for the chemical structures, or variation at the expression levels of these enzymes, which contributes to the quantitative variation in specialized metabolism ( Chan et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2019; Kroymann et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2019; Schilmiller et al., 2012 )

. Equally it may be possible to find within-species convergent evolution, where genotypes with the same metabolic profile actually contain completely different haplotypes that themselves arose from distinct haplotypic lineages. These genetic processes and interplay between genetics and selection overlap with neutral demographic processes like gene flow

. The allelic diversity at the GSL loci illustrates the benefit of simultaneously tracking the phenotype and genotype when working to understand the distribution of trait variation. For example, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin had low variability in aliphatic GSL chemotypes, which show strong geographic structure. By contrast, Central/North Europe had high aliphatic GSL diversity with chemotypes showing overlapping geographic distributions

. In this context, we are focusing the analogy on the fact that the two processes differ where they begin, same or different state. This raises the possibility for chemical variation within a species to exhibit parallel evolution, wherein independent new haplotypes with identical metabolic consequences arise multiple times from single-core haplotype

. It is not yet clear what selective pressures influence ACD6 genetic variation ( Todesco et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2018 ). Thus, loci controlling resistance to diverse biotic traits under natural conditions have diverse genetic architectures and further work is needed to assess the range of allelic heterogeneity in these adaptive loci

. Using these causal genotypes and chemotypes in combination with their geographic distribution provided evidence that the distribution of GSL metabolic diversity across Europe is influenced by a combination of demography and ecological factors. The ecological relationships to chemotype suggested a potential for variation in selective processes across the geographic regions studied. Future work will be needed to identify the specific biotic and/or abiotic factors shaping this distribution.

. However, it is not clear if biallelic phenotypic variation is created by biallelic genetic causation when investigating a large collection of individuals from wide-ranging populations within a species. If selective pressures are sufficiently non-linear, it is possible to have repeated and independent generation of structural variants creating the same metabolic variation in processes that are akin to parallel and convergent evolution are used to describe interspecific variation

. All three major aliphatic GSL loci display extensive allelic heterogeneity that is shaped by a blend of evolutionary events at each locus reminiscent of either parallel or convergent evolution. For this analogy, we are defining parallel evolution to be when a new chemotype arises two or more independent times by independent mutations from shared ancestral haplotype

. Conversely, we are considering convergent evolution of a chemotype to occur when independent mutations in independent ancestral haplotypes derive the same chemotype. GS-OH provided clear evidence of parallel evolution where a single functional haplotype gave rise to at least four independent LOF alleles all with similar phenotypic consequence. GS-AOP suggested the potential for convergent evolution-style events leading to MSO chemotype arising from LOF events at the GS-AOP locus

., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Kliebenstein, 2004; Malcolm, 1994; Thakur and Rai, 1982; Wolters and Jürgens, 2009; Yang et al., 2000 ). The complete blend, chemotype, of these metabolites helps to determine the plants’ survival and development, but the creation of any blend is complicated by the fact that individual specialized metabolites can have contrasting effects on the plant

. The fact that these independently derived LOF alleles are all contiguous suggests that they may be beneficial or neutral in Central Europe. GS-OH: The final major determinant of natural variation in Arabidopsis GSL chemotype is the GS-OH enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group to the carbon 2 on 3-butentyl GSL to create 2-OH-3-Butenyl GSL

    Title: Tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases by an amplification loop involving ROS, macrophages and JNK in Drosophila
    Abstract: Apoptosis and its molecular mediators, the caspases, have long been regarded as tumor suppressors and one hallmark of cancer is ‘Evading Apoptosis’. However, recent work has suggested that apoptotic caspases can also promote proliferation and tumor growth under certain conditions. How caspases promote proliferation and how cells are protected from the potentially harmful action of apoptotic caspases is largely unknown. Here, we show that although caspases are activated in a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila, oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras ( RasV12 ) maintain tumorous cells in an ‘undead’-like condition and transform caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promotors. Instead of killing cells, caspases now promote the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). One function of the ROS is the recruitment and activation of macrophage-like immune cells which in turn signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further promotes and amplifies caspase activity, thereby constituting a feedback amplification loop. Interfering with the amplification loop strongly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and significantly improves organismal survival. In conclusion, RasV12-modified caspases initiate a feedback amplification loop involving tumorous epithelial cells and macrophage-like immune cells that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior.

   ., 2013 ), our results demonstrated that oncogenic Ras can suppress the apoptotic activity of caspases and keeps scrib−/− RasV12 cells in an ‘undead’-like condition. While caspases may still induce apoptosis in a few tumor cells, they now largely promote generation of intra- and extracellular ROS which are required for malignant growth and tissue invasion of surviving neoplastic cells

. This work extends previous models about the conversion of Eiger and JNK signaling from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic Ras and identifies caspases as essential components of this switch. In conclusion, although apoptotic caspases are usually considered to be tumor suppressors, under certain conditions, for example in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells, they can also adopt a tumor-promoting role.

. We report that oncogenic Ras switches the pro-apoptotic activity of caspases into a tumor-promoting one and thereby maintains scrib−/− RasV12 cells in an ‘undead’-like state. Consistently, inhibition of caspases blocks tumor growth and tissue invasion. The tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS which are required for neoplastic behavior of scrib−/− RasV12 clones

Recently, in a model of ‘undead’ AiP, we showed that Duox-generated ROS are important for activation of hemocytes, JNK signaling and hyperplastic overgrowth ( Fogarty et al., 2016; Diwanji and Bergmann, 2017a; Diwanji and Bergmann, 2017b ). Therefore, we examined if ROS have a similar function in the neoplastic scrib−/− RasV12 tumor model in Drosophila

., 2016 ) ( reviewed by [Diwanji and Bergmann, 2017a; Diwanji and Bergmann, 2017b] ). Therefore, similar to the scrib−/− RasV12 case, Eiger and JNK signaling have proliferation- and growth-promoting functions in this ‘undead’ AiP model. These similarities prompted us to investigate the role of ROS and caspases for tumor growth of scrib−/− RasV12 clones in Drosophila

., 2015; Donato et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2011; Kurtova et al., 2015; Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015 ) ; reviewed by ( Ryoo and Bergmann, 2012; Ichim and Tait, 2016; Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017 ). Furthermore, in Drosophila it was previously shown that oncogenic Ras switches the tumor-suppressing function of JNK and Eiger in scrib−/− mutant cells to a tumor-promoting one in scrib−/− RasV12 cells ( Igaki et al., 2006; Cordero et al., 2010; Uhlirova et al

. This is in striking contrast to scrib−/− mutant cells alone in which JNK signaling triggers linear caspase activation and apoptosis ( Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Igaki et al., 2006; Igaki et al., 2009; Uhlirova et al., 2005 ). In later stages of tumorigenesis, the amplification loop may have reached full strength and promotes malignant growth and invasion of scrib−/− RasV12 cells ( Figure 6 )

. Another important question for future studies will be to address how RasV12 switches the activity of caspases from tumor-suppressors to tumor-promoters. A known target of survival signaling by RasV12 is the pro-apoptotic gene Hid which acts upstream of caspase activation ( Bergmann et al., 1998; Kurada and White, 1998 ). Because Eiger and JNK can induce expression of hid ( Moreno et al., 2002 ), it is possible that Hid activity is inhibited by oncogenic Ras

., 2009; Cordero et al., 2010 ). In fact, activation of JNK in oncogenic RasV12 background is sufficient to trigger a neoplastic tumor phenotype similar to the scrib−/− RasV12 condition ( Uhlirova et al., 2005; Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006 ). Therefore, we examined the relation between ROS, caspases and JNK signaling. In a first set of experiments, we blocked JNK signaling by expressing a dominant negative JNK construct ( JNKDN ) in scrib−/− RasV12 mutant clones

. Furthermore, caspase-induced ROS are essential for the recruitment and activation of hemocytes at scrib−/− RasV12 mosaic discs. Hemocytes signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to stimulate JNK signaling which further promotes caspase activity. Thus, these events constitute a feedback amplification loop which is necessary for neoplastic activity of scrib−/− RasV12 cells

. Therefore, it is possible that RasV12 modifies caspase activity in a different manner – directly or indirectly – for non-apoptotic ROS generation. Oncogenic Ras is mediating many steps in the tumorigenic process of scrib−/− RasV12 tissue. It changes the transcriptome of these cells and modifies the downstream activities of JNK ( Atkins et al., 2016; Külshammer et al., 2015 )

., 2016; Külshammer et al., 2015 ). However, as shown in this work, a critical step mediated by RasV12 is the modification of caspase activity – directly or indirectly – in the early stage of tumorigenesis in a way that the cells survive. At present it is unclear if the caspase-modulating activity of RasV12 is dependent on transcription. There may not be enough time for a transcriptional response by the cell to escape the apoptotic activity of caspases

. Evidence of an amplification loop is provided by the mutual dependence of caspases, ROS and JNK ( Figure 5; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Similar amplification loops have been described in apoptotic and ‘undead’ cells ( Wells et al., 2006; Shlevkov and Morata, 2012; Fogarty et al., 2016 ). This amplification loop ensures persistent oncogenic signaling in scrib−/− RasV12 cells

. In both scrib−/− and scrib−/− RasV12 mutant cells, this JNK activity results in caspase activation ( Figures 3 and 5A ). However, due to the anti-apoptotic activity of RasV12, caspases induce only very little apoptosis in scrib RasV12 clones ( Figure 3 ). Therefore, although caspases are active, most scrib−/− RasV12 cells do not die and thus are in an ‘undead’-like state. Caspases now promote the generation of extracellular ROS through activation of NADPH oxidase Duox

., 2005; Chen et al., 2012 ). In contrast, in scrib−/− RasV12 mutant cells, this caspase activity persists, but does not appear to induce a significant amount of apoptosis. Therefore, these data suggest that RasV12 maintains scrib−/− cells in an ‘undead’-like condition, consistent with a previous report ( Hirabayashi et al., 2013 ). Inhibition of casases in scrib/− Ras12 significantly reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organismal survival ( Figure 6 )

    Title: Perception of social interaction compresses subjective duration in an oxytocin-dependent manner
    Abstract: Communication through body gestures permeates our daily life. Efficient perception of the message therein reflects one’s social cognitive competency. Here we report that such competency is manifested temporally as shortened subjective duration of social interactions: motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration as compared with those acting noncommunicatively. The strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency. Critically, intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate that perceived time, rather than being a faithful representation of physical time, is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait. Moreover, they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition.

   . 53, p=0. 60 ) ( Figure 3C ). These results, while reaffirming the influence of perceived social interactions on subjective duration, highlighted the idiosyncrasy of subjective time for social interactions, and tied it to a stable personality trait –– social proficiency. Autistic traits have been widely associated with reduced levels of oxytocin ( Clark et al., 2013; Green et al., 2001; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al

., 2001; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al., 2014 ), and can be ameliorated with intranasal oxytocin administration ( Anagnostou et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2013; Guastella et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2015; Yatawara et al., 2016 ). The link between autistic-like tendency and subjective duration of social interactions thus raises the intriguing question of whether oxytocin plays a role therein

. To further verify if antagonizing the effect of oxytocin would diminish the temporal compression effect of perceived social interactions, we turned to socially proficient individuals

. Rather, it relies on the observer’s intrinsic autistic-like tendency, such that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the effect than socially proficient ones ( Experiment 4 ). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon critically involves oxytocin. In socially less proficient individuals that overall have lower levels of endogenous oxytocin ( Andari et al., 2014; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al

. Experiment 5 probed this question by testing if the application of oxytocin would promote the social interaction-induced temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals. The same task as in Experiment 4 was employed

. Given the aforementioned relationships among social proficiency, oxytocin and neural processing of social stimuli, our hypothesis was that both social proficiency, which reflects endogenous oxytocin level, and exogenous manipulations of oxytocin level would influence the neural efficacy in processing social interactions, and thereby modulate the subjective time of perceived social interactions.

., 2011; Olff et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, we were able to show that antagonizing the effect of endogenous oxytocin with atosiban in this group of observers reduced the temporal compression effect as compared to a placebo control. The comparison between oxytocin and atosiban spoke directly to the role of oxytocin in mediating time perception of social interactions

., 2014; Tost et al., 2010 ). Likely through interactions with endogenous oxytocin, intranasally administered oxytocin ( Dal Monte et al., 2014; Freeman et al., 2016; Lee and Weerts, 2016; Striepens et al., 2013 ) is found to alter the processing of social stimuli including biological motion in manners that depend on one’s social proficiency ( Bartz et al., 2011; Kéri and Benedek, 2009 ) as well as blood oxytocin concentration ( Parker et al., 2017 )

. In a series of experiments, we carefully manipulated point-light displays of acting agents to dissociate the perception of social interaction and that of biological motion. We assessed temporal perception of such displays in individuals varying in social proficiency, and critically examined the role of oxytocin in this process

., 2014; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al., 2014 ), oxytocin administration promotes the social interaction induced temporal compression effect ( Experiment 5 ). By contrast, in socially proficient individuals with overall higher levels of endogenous oxytocin, the very effect is diminished following the application of an oxytocin antagonist named atosiban ( Experiment 6 )

. Of note here is that this temporal compression effect can hardly be accounted for by the operation of a dedicated neural module specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events ( Ivry and Schlerf, 2008 ), since it is specific to the perception of social interactions. Oxytocin partially drives social motivation ( Dölen et al

., 2010; Bartz et al., 2011 ), thereby giving rise to their shortened subjective duration of social interactions following oxytocin administration. In socially proficient individuals, the influence of exogenous oxytocin is more complicated, even hard to predict and interpret ( Bartz, 2016; Bartz et al., 2010; Bartz et al., 2011; Olff et al., 2013 )

., 2003; Insel et al., 1999 ). Results from human brain imaging studies indicate that the application of oxytocin modulates responses in the STS, TPJ and the prefrontal cortex, among others, in various social cognitive tasks ( Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2012 ). Such alterations of neural activities presumably facilitate social processing in socially less proficient individuals, where exogenous oxytocin has been shown to exert a more definitive prosocial effect ( Bartz et al

., 2006 ). Social proficiency varies widely even among neurotypical individuals, and is manifested behaviorally as a stable personality trait ( Digman, 1990 ). This inter-individual variance has been associated with plasma concentrations of oxytocin, a well-documented prosocial neuropeptide, as well as polymorphisms of its receptor gene OXTR ( Andari et al., 2014; Donaldson and Young, 2008; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al., 2014; Skuse et al., 2014; Tost et al., 2010 )

As one of many social species, humans seek out companionship and social interactions. The current study demonstrates that such a motive is weaved in our mental representation of time: Motion sequences depicting agents engaging in social interactions tend to be perceived as shorter in duration than those showing agents acting noncommunicatively

. This finding also adds to and extends the extant pharmacological research on time perception, which has primarily focused on dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine ( Allman and Meck, 2012; Meck, 1998 ). We conclude that the perceived duration of social interactions is a product of complex neuroendocrine and neural processes, the exact mechanism awaiting further investigation, and is ingrained with one’s social traits

. In other words, they were not significantly biased in making duration judgments of communicative and noncommunicative motion sequences before oxytocin administration but became biased towards perceiving the communicative ones as shorter in duration afterwards, and showed increased PSEs

., 2005; Grossman and Blake, 2002; Vaina et al., 2001 ) that plays an important role in social perception in both monkeys and humans ( Allison et al., 2000 ). Meanwhile, inter-individual variation is noteworthy. People with autism characterized by impaired social interaction and communication show both a deficit of biological motion perception ( Blake et al., 2003; Klin et al., 2009 ) and abnormalities in the STS ( Zilbovicius et al., 2006 )

. Temporally adjacent actions generally tend to be inferred as a causal sequence and hence communicative ( Lagnado and Sloman, 2006 ). But ultimately that social ‘meaning’ is derived from the observer’s interpretations of the agents’ actions and the relationship in between, and is, to a certain degree, subjective in nature. The present study aimed to address the effect of perceived social interaction on subjective time and its relationship with one’s intrinsic social proficiency

. Whereas distortion of time perception has been widely associated with properties of the stimuli ( Eagleman, 2008 ) and the context ( Shi et al., 2013 ), these findings provide, to our best knowledge, the first empirical evidence that links the subjective time of an event with a personality trait, namely social proficiency. In doing so, they open up a new avenue to probe automatic processing of complex social interplays at the individual level

    A study investigated the effect of social interaction on subjective time perception and its relationship with social proficiency. Results showed that social interactions are perceived as shorter in duration compared to non-social interactions. This effect was stronger in individuals with lower autistic-like tendencies. Intranasal oxytocin administration restored the effect in less socially proficient individuals, while atosiban, an oxytoc antagonist, diminished it in socially proficient ones. These findings suggest time is not a faithful representation of physical time but idiosyncratic and ingrained with personality. Oxytoc is involved in mediating time of social interaction, supporting its role in human cognition.

The study manipulated light displays of agents to dissociate perception of social and biological motion. Temporal perception was assessed in individuals varying social proficiency and oxyin process. Oxytoc administration promoted interaction temporal effect in less proficient, while atos diminished it in proficient. The effect cannot be accounted for by a dedicated module representing temporal relationships, as it is specific to social interactions. Oxy drives motivation, giving rise to shortened duration following administration. In proficient, oxy influence is complicated and hard to predict. Brain imaging studies indicate oxy modulates responses in ST, TPJ, and prefrontal cortex in social tasks. Alterations facilitate processing in less proficient, exogenous oxy has prosocial effect. Proficiency varies among neurotypical, manifested as stable trait, associated with oxy concentrations and OTR polymorphisms.

The study demonstrates social motive is woven in mental representation of time. Motion depicting social interactions tend to be perceived shorter than non-communicative. This adds to pharmacological research on time, focusing dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Perceived duration is product of neuroendocrine and neural processes, ingrained with social traits.

    Title: Effects of common mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and its ligand, the human ACE2 receptor on binding affinity and kinetics
    Abstract: The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is required for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the B. 1. 1. 7 lineage has a mutation ( N501Y ) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations ( K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N ) and two common ACE2 mutations ( S19P and K26R ) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha ( B. 1. 1. 7 ), Beta ( B. 1. 351 ), and Gamma ( P1 ) variants. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape.

   ., 2020 ). Because of these differences, our analysis may not detect the full effects of RBD and ACE2 mutations on the Spike/ACE2 interaction. A second caveat is that we have not examined the effect of these mutations on viral attachment to cells. Studies of other enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV, suggest that increases in affinity of viral ligands for their cellular receptors can increase cell infection and disease severity ( Hasegawa et al., 2007; Li et al., 2005 )

. The effect of the increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD of the K26R and S19P ACE2 mutants is less clear. The evidence summarised above that WT RBD/ACE2 binding is limiting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, suggest that carriers of these ACE2 variants will be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, the effects of ACE2 variants are primarily relevant to the carriers of these mutations. A preliminary analysis ( MacGowan et al

. We also examined the effect on ACE2 binding of combinations of RBD mutations, including combinations present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage ( N501Y ) with the E484K mutation ( “SARS-CoV-2 Variants of concern and variants under investigation – GOV. UK, ” 2021 ), and the Beta and Gamma variants ( Figure 3C, Table 1 )

., 2021b; Volz et al., 2021b ). The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells following an interaction between the Spike ( S ) protein on its surface with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) on cell surfaces ( V’kovski et al., 2021 ). The receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) of the Spike protein binds the membrane-distal portion of the ACE2 protein

., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Precise information is needed to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion. In this study, we undertook a detailed affinity and kinetic analysis of the interaction between Spike RBD and ACE2 at a physiological temperature ( 37°C ), taking care to avoid common pitfalls

. We used this optimised approach to analyse the effect of important common mutations identified in variants of RBD and ACE2. Both mutations of ACE2 ( S19P, K26R ) and most of the mutations of RBD ( N501Y, E484K, and S477N ) enhanced the interaction, with one RBD mutation ( N501Y ) increasing the affinity by ~10-fold. Increased binding was the result of decreases in dissociation rate constants ( N501Y, S477N ) and/or increases in association rate constants ( N501Y, E484K )

., 2021; Madhi et al., 2021a; Madhi et al., 2021b; Mahase, 2021 ). What is less clear is the precise effect of these mutations on the affinity and kinetics of the binding of RBD to ACE2. Previous studies of the interaction between the Spike RBD and ACE2 have produced a wide range of affinity and kinetic estimates under conditions ( e. g. temperature ) that are not always well defined ( Lei et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al

The focus of this study was to analyse common and therefore important variants of RBD and ACE2. Henceforth, we will refer to the common ACE2 allele and RBD of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain sequenced in Wuhan as wild type ( WT ). We chose mutations of RBD within the ACE2 binding site that have appeared independently in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages/clades ( Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Hodcroft, 2021; Rambaut et al

. The affinity of the Beta ( K417N/ E484K/N501Y ) and Gamma ( K417T/E484K/N501Y ) RBD variants for ACE2 increased by 3. 7- and 5. 3-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type RBD, by both increasing the kon and decreasing the koff rate constants. We next examined whether the effects of the mutations were additive, as is typically the case for multiple mutations at protein/protein interfaces ( Wells, 1990 )

., 2021 ). We selected for analysis the two most common mutations of ACE2 within the RBD binding site, K26R and S19P ( Figure 1C ). They are present in 0. 4% and 0. 03%, respectively, of all samples in the gnomAD database ( Karczewski et al., 2020 ), while other ACE2 mutations in the RBD binding site are much less frequent ( <0. 004% ) ( MacGowan et al., 2021 )

. This is consistent with them being spaced well apart within the interface ( Figure 1C ) and validates the accuracy of the affinity measurements. We next examined the effects of mutations of ACE2 ( S19P and K26R ) on binding to both wild-type and common variants of RBD ( Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Table 1 ). Both S19P and K26R increased the affinity of WT RBD binding by ~3. 7- and ~ 2. 4-fold ( Figure 4A )

., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020 ). A later mutation, N501Y, which has appeared in multiple lineages, lies within the RBD, and increases its affinity for ACE2 ( Starr et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021 ). These findings suggest that mutations that directly or indirectly enhance Spike binding to ACE2 may increase transmissibility

., 2021; Lei et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021 ). We next evaluated the effect of RBD mutations on the affinity and kinetics of binding to ACE2 ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). Example sensorgrams are shown of mutations that increased ( N501Y, Figure 3A ) or decreased ( K417N, Figure 3B ) the binding affinity, while the key results from all mutants are summarised in Figure 3C

. Several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing the Spike/ACE2 interaction would be advantageous for the virus. First, the virus has spread only very recently to humans from another mammalian host, providing insufficient time for optimisation of the affinity. Second, epidemiological studies have suggested that the Alpha variant, which has the N501Y mutation, has enhanced transmissibility ( Volz et al., 2021a; Washington et al., 2021 )

While our finding that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds ACE2 with an affinity of KD 74 nM at 37°C is consistent with previous studies ( KD 6–133 nM ) ( Laffeber et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al,202; Wrapp et,202; Zhang et al,202; Zhang et al,202 ), the effect of R mutations on the interaction is less clear. We found that mutations in the RBD (501, 484, and 477 ) increased the affinity of R/ACE interaction by 3. 7, 2. 5 and 1.5 fold, respectively, while mutations in ACE (19 and K26 ) increased the affinity of WT RBD by 3.7 and 2.4 fold, respectively. In contrast, the K417/T mutation decreased the affinity of R/ACE by 2. 5 fold. We also examined the effect of combinations of R mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 Alpha ( B.1.1.7 ), Beta ( B.1.351 ) and Gamma ( P ) variants ( Figure 3, Table 1 ) and found that most increased the affinity of the R/ACE interaction, with the exception of K/T which decreased the affinity by 2.5 fold.

    Title: A map of directional genetic interactions in a metazoan cell
    Abstract: Gene–gene interactions shape complex phenotypes and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. The effects of statistical gene–gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional, epistatic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large-scale. Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells. Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations.

   . We report the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date. Our map comprises 1367 Drosophila genes implicated in cellular processes including signalling, chromatin and cell cycle regulation. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. First, we inferred gene functions based on statistical genetic interactions, predicted protein complexes and clustered processes by similarity

We generated the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date by co-depleting gene pairs by RNAi in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, high-throughput imaging of single-cell phenotypes, and modelling of gene–gene interactions ( Figure 1A ). We selected 1367 genes implicated in key biological processes, that is, signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation and protein turnover control ( Supplementary file 1 )

. Furthermore, we demonstrate an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling, which we confirmed in vivo. We demonstrate that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships.

. This unbiased mapping and automated inference of directional epistatic interactions, made possible by the multivariate phenotyping approach, revealed a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle ( Figure 5B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 05464. 014Figure 5.

We found genetic interactions between the SWI/SNF complex with both the SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeller dalao ( Papoulas et al

. The detection of recurrent mutations in genes and pathways in cancers ( Tamborero et al., 2013 ) has resulted in a growing catalogue of known cancer mutations, however, in any individual tumour, only a subset of these mutations is present, and how they cooperatively produce the cancer phenotype is often not well understood. We aimed to use our directional interaction network to predict relationships between recurrent cancer mutations

. It would be interesting to study how our approach can be extended to detect mixed directional relationships. Another avenue for future work is the combination of directional genetic interaction mapping with Bayesian modelling ( Battle et al., 2010 ) to further improve the inference of regulatory networks. For the gene set presented here, we predicted the temporal and causal relationships between cell cycle regulators during mitosis without using prior knowledge

. Such information could be instrumental for understanding the joint effect of multiple mutated genes, for example, in the same tumour, and may contribute to understanding tumour evolution and drug sensitivity. We have demonstrated inference of directional genetic interactions from multiple phenotypes as a new approach to shed light on the patterns underlying complex genotype-phenotype relationships

. The recurrently mutated DNA damage response gene RecQ4 ( WRN ) aggravates jumu, while Nup75 aggravates Sin3A ( SIN3A/B ). This results in a network structure containing a loop. Taken together, this demonstrates that our method of mapping epistatic interactions can predict network structures of regulatory activity.

. Our map encompasses approximately 1300 genes for which we derived genetic interaction profiles, the largest genetic interaction map generated for a metazoan cell to date. The study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale, automated discovery of directional epistatic interactions. There are also other approaches to annotate relationships between genes

. Moreover, in a novel analytical approach, we employ the multivariate nature of the phenotypes to compute directional genetic interactions, and we show that they reveal the logical and temporal dependencies between functional modules. For example, we were able to reconstruct the temporal order in which protein complexes are active during mitosis

. Of these, 1040 were alleviating and 304 aggravating ( Supplementary file 6 ). This directional genetic interaction network provided a rich snapshot of regulatory, causal and temporal relationships. For instance, we detected an alleviating interaction between the APC/C member Cdc23 and the cytokinesis regulator sti. After knockdown of Cdc23, we recorded reduced growth and slightly smaller nuclear area ( Figure 4B–C, blue arrows for the two independent dsRNAs )

. Next, we tested whether mutations in SWI/SNF complex components could suppress a Ras gain-of-function rough eye phenotype in the Drosophila eye ( Zipursky and Rubin, 1994 ). As shown in Figure 6D, the phenotype caused by the expression of constitutively active Ras85DV12 in the eye was rescued by mutant alleles of the SWI/SNF members osa, Snr1 or brm ( Figure 6D–E ). 10. 7554/eLife. 05464. 015Figure 6. Genetic interactions between Ras signalling and chromatin remodelling

. In addition, we confirmed the genetic interactions of SWI/SNF components with constitutively active KRAS in human colon cancer cells. Recent cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed many recurrent mutations that are individually rare ( Chin et al., 2011 ). A current challenge is to order these genetic variants by their functional and phenotypic effects. We have demonstrated a method to detect which recurrently mutated genes modify each other's phenotypes

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05464. 007 To obtain an initial overview of the patterns of genetic interactions, we clustered the interaction profiles of each of the 1293 genes across the 21 phenotypes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows nine representative phenotypic features ). We constructed a correlation graph that represents the similarity between interaction profiles across all phenotypes for each gene pair ( Figure 3A )

., 2013; Roguev et al., 2013 ). These approaches have successfully unravelled symmetric relationships, such as pathway and complex co-membership ( Baryshnikova et al., 2013 ). However, the observation of a statistical genetic interaction implies no directionality between the genes: it does not take into account a possible order of relationships, for example, their temporal relation in a signalling cascade

. Even though algorithmic and statistical approaches have been tuned over the last 10 years to address this issue, the number of detected instances of epistasis in genome-wide association studies remains small ( Lincoln et al., 2005; Gregersen et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2014 ).

    Title: Presence versus absence of CYP734A50 underlies the style-length dimorphism in primroses
    Abstract: Heterostyly is a wide-spread floral adaptation to promote outbreeding, yet its genetic basis and evolutionary origin remain poorly understood. In Primula ( primroses ), heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the Primula CYP734A50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. CYP734A50 is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene.

   . doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 17956. 022 Thus, our combined evidence indicates that CYP734A50 represents the G locus in the Primula heterostyly supergene, whose expression in S-morph styles causes brassinosteroid degradation, limiting cell expansion and style elongation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Evolutionarily, CYP734A50 arose via a lineage-specific gene duplication and presumably gain of style-specific expression

. The proposed duplication and gain of style-specific expression of CYP734A50 in the ancestor of the Primulaceae likely represents this dominant style-shortening mutation. As such, CYP734A50 is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism ( Schwander et al., 2014 ) that opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus as an iconic case of a complex supergene.

Thus, the same causal genes should co-segregate with morph phenotypes in all heterostylous Primula species. To test this for CYP734A50, we sequenced style transcriptomes of the distantly related P

Thus, the CYP734A50 presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the Primula phylogeny, and the gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. Together with the VIGS results, this strongly supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism. 10. 7554/eLife. 17956. 016Figure 3

Heterostyly in Primula is controlled by the S-locus supergene that likely comprises five tightly linked genes, determining style length ( the so-called G locus ), anther height, pollen size and male and female intra-morph incompatibility ( Figure 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) ( Ernst, 1936; Lewis and Jones, 1992 )

. First, loss of CYP734A50 activity should lengthen styles; second, S-morph styles should contain lower amounts of active brassinosteroids than L-morph styles; third, cell expansion of S-morph styles should be rescued by brassinosteroid treatment. We assayed the CYP734A50 genotype in seven derived long homostyles with independent evolutionary origins ( Mast et al., 2006 )

. Thus, the presence/absence polymorphism of CYP734A50 has been maintained as a trans-specific polymorphism in strict linkage with the G locus over more than 20 million years of evolution, indicating that it is under strong balancing selection, as predicted for a causal heterostyly locus ( Mast and Conti, 2006 ). The hypothesis that CYP734A50 represents the G locus and limits cell expansion by degrading brassinosteroids makes three testable predictions

. A molecular phylogeny of angiosperm CYP734A proteins found in sequenced genomes indicated that CYP734A50 arose via a gene duplication specific to the Primula lineage ( Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Like the male sex-determining gene SRY in mammals ( O'Neill and O'Neill, 1999; Tucker and Lundrigan, 1995 ), a causal heterostyly gene present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes in a non-recombining region should be subject to two opposing effects

However, in Primula no causal distyly gene has been isolated, and no plausible mechanistic explanation for style length dimorphism is available in any species, hampering progress in understanding the evolution of the S-locus supergene. 10. 7554/eLife. 17956. 003Figure 1

. This suggests that a promoter mutation or epigenetic silencing of CYP734A50 is responsible for the long-style phenotype, providing an alternative route to the formation of self-compatible long homostyles in nature ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We newly identified long-homostylous, yet apparently self-incompatible mutants from commercially grown P. vulgaris and P. x pruhoniciana ( Figure 3B, C; Figure 2—figure supplement 5 )

. We focussed on transcript DN148700_c0_g1, encoding CYP734A50 as a member of the cytochrome P450 CYP734A-family that degrade brassinosteroids ( Ohnishi et al., 2006; Thornton et al., 2011 ), a class of plant hormones promoting cell elongation. No reads mapping to CYP734A50 were detected in L-morph samples ( Figure 1B; Figure 1—source data 1 ). RT-PCR confirmed specific expression in styles of S-morphs of P. veris and the closely related P

. The S-morph haplotype carries dominant alleles at all loci, resulting in short styles due to reduced cell elongation ( Webster and Gilmartin, 2006 ) and anthers at the mouth of the flower; the L-morph haplotype carries the recessive alleles, causing long styles and low anthers

The final answer is: 

In a study published in the journal eLife, researchers have identified the CYP73450 gene as the locus responsible for the style-length dimorphism in primros, a type of flowering plant. The CYP50 gene encodes a putative brassinoster-degrading enzyme, which is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype and is specifically expressed in S-m styles. The loss of CYP50 leads to long styles. The gene arose via a specific duplication in the Primulaceae lineage and has an accelerated molecular evolution rate. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the Sloc as a model for a complex supergene.

    Title: High-frequency stimulation-induced peptide release synchronizes arcuate kisspeptin neurons and excites GnRH neurons
    Abstract: Kisspeptin ( Kiss1 ) and neurokinin B ( NKB ) neurocircuits are essential for pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( Kiss1ARH ) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 ( GnRH ) neurons, the synaptic mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked local release of excitatory ( NKB ) and inhibitory ( dynorphin ) neuropeptides, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1ARH neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. We propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

    Supporting Text:
   . It is known that nerve fibers expressing kisspeptin or co-expressing kisspeptin and NKB are localized in the internal zone of the median eminence in mice and rats ( Clarkson et al., 2009; True et al., 2010 ), and a recent report has shown that simultaneous activation of Kiss1ARH neurons with optogenetic stimulation generates LH release in vivo, which is thought to be via kisspeptin-mediated depolarization of GnRH nerve terminals ( Han et al., 2015 )

. We discovered that high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ), which was modulated by co-released dynorphin, and caused synchronization of Kiss1ARH neurons. Interestingly, activation of Kiss1ARH neurons co-released glutamate that excited the rostral Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons.

. Kiss1ARH neurons also communicate with the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge. Kisspeptin, GPR54, NKB, Tacr3 and GnRH are all required for normal fertility. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10

. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1 neurons in the ARH releases NKB that depolarizes and recruits other Kiss1ARH neurons. Dynorphin is co-released and acts presynaptically to modulate ( inhibit ) the release of NKB. Together the two peptides govern the synchronous activity of Kiss1ARH neurons and promote kisspeptin release that stimulates GnRH release in the median eminence ( ME )

., 2010 ) and may stimulate pulsatile release of GnRH in the ovariectomized state ( Yip et al., 2015 ). Hence, Kiss1ARH neurons probably play a dual role of driving pulsatile ( episodic ) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway ( Figure 12 )

. These results are summarized in Figure 12. Therefore, our findings provide the first evidence that Kiss1ARH neurons can synchronize via NKB/Dyn auto-excitation/inhibition to provide an excitatory drive ( via Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ) to GnRH neurons for stimulating GnRH neuronal activity and subsequent GnRH release. This does not preclude the fact that Kiss1ARH neurons also project to the median eminence ( True et al

., 1990 ). Currently, we explored the synaptic mechanisms by which Kiss1ARH neurons synchronize their burst firing activity and how their unified activity was conveyed to the rostral Kiss 1AVPV/PeN neurons and hence excitation of GnRH neurons. We used a combination of whole-cell patch recording, optogenetics, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR to elucidate the underlying synaptic mechanisms at multiple sites

., 2009 ), and in our studies release of NKB. Therefore, it appears that Kiss1ARH neurons are contacted by other Kiss1ARH nerve terminals, and the activation of the Kiss1ARH network is dependent on action potential-driven synaptic release of NKB. Moreover, Kiss1ARH fibers crossing within the median eminence allow for synaptic communication between the arcuate nuclei for recruiting bilaterally additional Kiss1 neurons to generate a robust excitatory drive to GnRH neurons

Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 ( GnRH ), and consequently pulsatile release of pituitary luteinizing hormone ( LH ), is required for normal reproductive function, and there is increasing evidence that kisspeptin ( Kiss1 ) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( ARH ) are a component of the “GnRH pulse generator” ( Navarro et al., 2009; Navarro et al., 2011a; Lehman et al., 2010a; Okamura et al., 2013 )

. Therefore, NKB/Tacr3 signaling is upstream from kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling, and activation of kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling via Tacr3 stimulation results in excitation of GnRH neurons. 10. 7554/eLife. 16246. 011Figure 9. Tacr3 agonist senktide excites GnRH neurons indirectly through ARH Kiss1 neurons, and a slow EPSP in GnRH neurons is evoked with photoactivation of ChR2 Kiss1ARH neurons

. What is intriguing is the possibility that the differential release of amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters ( segregated co-transmission ) ( Vaaga et al., 2014 ) occurs at these different release sites ( ARH, median eminence, and AVPV/PeN ) to coordinate reproductive function. 10. 7554/eLife. 16246. 014Figure 12. Proposed model by which activation of Kiss1 neurons governs GnRH neuronal excitability

., 2015; Ducret et al., 2010 ), the question became how does activation of Kiss1ARH neurons excite GnRH neurons? A recent study has shown that mouse Kiss1ARH neurons project to Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ( Yip et al., 2015 ). Indeed, we recorded light-evoked EPSCs in Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ( 33. 2 ± 9. 7 pA, n = 5 ) following photostimulation of fibers from ChR2-mCherry or from ChR2-YFP expressing Kiss1ARH neurons ( Figure 10A–D )

. Finally, in horizontal but not the coronal hypothalamic slices, the Tacr3 agonist senktide indirectly excited GnRH neurons, and high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons depolarized/excited GnRH neurons via a multisynaptic pathway that involved glutamatergic excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons, which excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin release. High-frequency stimulation is required to evoke peptide release as originally demonstrated in the frog ganglion by Jan et al

. Recent findings also indicate that Kiss1ARH neurons co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 ( vGluT2 ) and release the neurotransmitter glutamate ( Cravo et al., 2011; Nestor et al., 2016 ), which could also provide an excitatory drive to hypothalamic neurons ( Van den Pol et al., 1990 )

. Therefore, in both kisspeptin and histamine neurons there is glutamate-dependent ( low-frequency ) and peptide-dependent ( high-frequency ) release that transmit distinct postsynaptic excitatory effects; but in the case of Kiss1ARH neurons, it is a recurrent auto-excitation that allows recruitment of neighboring Kiss1ARH neurons for synchronizing firing. Also unique to Kiss1ARH neurons is that high-frequency stimulation co-released dynorphin, which modulated the NKB-Tacr3 response

. We used a horizontal slice preparation from Kiss1-Cre-ChR2::GnRH-EGFP mice, which contains both the ARH and AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons and preoptic GnRH neurons, to determine if an NKB agonist could excite GnRH neurons via a multi-synaptic pathway. Given that essentially all Kiss1ARH neurons project to KissAV/Pe neurons ( Y et al. 2015 ), we hypothesized that activation of KissAR neurons would excite GnRH via glutamaterg input to KissAV/Pe neurons, which in turn excite GnRH via kisspein release.

    Title: Bone morphogenic protein signalling suppresses differentiation of pluripotent cells by maintaining expression of E-Cadherin
    Abstract: Bone morphogenic protein ( BMP ) signalling contributes towards maintenance of pluripotency and favours mesodermal over neural fates upon differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. We report that BMP regulates differentiation by blocking downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We find that loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. We further show that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. We conclude that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues, and we explain how a key pluripotency signal, BMP, feeds into this control mechanism.

    Supporting Text:
   . Although it is well established that BMP signalling contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency ( Ying et al., 2003a; Di-Gregorio et al., 2007 ), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We propose that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining expression of Cdh1. We support this idea by showing that suppressing Cdh1 is sufficient to rescue the BMP-imposed block to multilineage differentiation. It is also unclear how BMP signalling favours mesodermal over neural fates

. We conclude that part of the mechanism by which BMP helps to maintain pluripotency is through maintenance of Cdh1, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate. Taken together, these findings help to explain why BMP can at the same time protect pluripotency and promote mesoderm differentiation.

. In summary, we have identified the loss of Cdh1 activity as a limiting event for the earliest stages of neural differentiation and we propose that BMP controls differentiation in part by maintaining Cdh1 expression. The strategy of coupling changes in cell adhesion to transcriptional control of cell fate specification is used several times during development as a way of coordinating tissue morphogenesis ( Owens et al., 2000; Martínez-Estrada et al

. We find that the BMP target gene Id1 imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm. The ability of Id1 to block neural differentiation is therefore unlikely to be explained entirely by inhibition of a neural-inducing transcription factor as is commonly assumed, nor by a direct activation of mesoderm differentiation, but rather to a shift in the positional identity of pluripotent cells that occurs in the absence of overt differentiation

The events that drive the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment remain poorly understood. It has been known for many years that BMP signalling protects pluripotency and suppresses neural specification ( Ying et al., 2003a; Stern, 2006; Di-Gregorio et al., 2007 ), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. BMP signalling is also required for the formation of mesoderm in vivo ( Mishina et al., 1995; Winnier et al., 1995; Lawson et al., 1999; Beppu et al

. Id1 may therefore play an early role in anterior-posterior ( AP ) patterning and mesoderm priming, independent from any effect on overt mesoderm differentiation. This helps to reconcile why BMP is required both for mesoderm differentiation and for the maintenance of pluripotency. Taken together, our data help to unify the distinct effects of BMP signalling during differentiation of pluripotent cells

The BMP target gene Id1 has been reported to inhibit neural induction and instead favour either pluripotency or mesoderm differentiation from pluripotent cells ( Ying et al., 2003a; Zhang et al., 2010 ), but the precise events controlled by Id1, and the mechanism by which it acts, are not known. In order to address these questions, we first asked where Id1 is expressed in the early post-implantation embryo. It has been reported ( Jen et al

. Taken together, these observations suggest that downregulation of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for pluripotent cells to differentiate into neural cells. The data reported above indicate that BMP/Id can maintain Cdh1, and that downregulation of Cdh1 is a limiting event during differentiation of ES cells. These findings raise the possibility that the mechanism by which BMP blocks differentiation could be through maintenance of Cdh1

., 1995; Winnier et al., 1995; Lawson et al., 1999; Beppu et al., 2000; Davis et al., 2004 ). However, BMP signalling is also necessary for maintenance of pluripotency ( Di-Gregorio et al., 2007 ), and mouse embryos in which BMP has been experimentally overactivated have an impairment in mesoderm differentiation that cannot easily be explained by models in which BMP drives mesoderm differentiation ( Aoyama et al., 2012 )

. This system allows us to monitor the kinetics as well as the direction of differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 01197. 005Figure 2. BMP signalling maintains Cdh1 expression during differentiation of pluripotent cells. ( A ) BMP blocks neural differentiation, maintains pluripotency and has both positive and negative effects on mesoderm differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP acts in each case are not well understood

. We next confirmed that 5 ng/ml BMP4 upregulates posterior epiblast markers whilst delaying overt differentiation into mesoderm and endoderm ( Figure 6D, black bars ), as expected. Under these conditions, suppression of Cdh1 via dox-induction of TwE efficiently rescues mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, but not neural differentiation ( Figure 6D )

. However, it is not clear how the effects of BMP on mesoderm differentiation relate to its pro-pluripotency and anti-neural effects: are these separable independent events or do they represent the outcomes of one common mechanism? This question underlines our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which BMP influences neural and mesodermal specification. BMP acts through transcriptional upregulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation ( Id ) factors ( Ying et al., 2003a; Zhang et al

. We demonstrate this directly by showing that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity can rescue neural differentiation capacity in this recalcitrant subpopulation resulting in a more homogenous differentiation response. Importantly, this can be achieved by non-genetic means, such as function-blocking E-Cadherin antibodies, providing a convenient and readily applicable means to improve our control over pluripotent cells

. Taken together, these data suggest that the BMP target gene Id1 does not drive overt mesoderm differentiation but rather maintains Cdh1 and helps to maintain a primed pluripotent state similar to that of the post-implantation epiblast, whilst imposing a proximal posterior ( T+ Nanog+ ) epiblast identity that is primed for mesoderm differentiation. The data described above reveal an unexpected ability of BMP to maintain Cdh1 expression

. Strikingly, suppressing Cdh1 at these lower doses of BMP is sufficient to rescue neural differentiation, indicating that the primary mechanism by which BMP inhibits neural differentiation in this context is through its ability to control Cadherin activity. This is an unexpected finding that highlights the importance of cell adhesion and tissue organisation in controlling receptivity of cells to differentiation cues ( Stepniak et al., 2009; Faunes et al., 2013 )

. It has been proposed ( Constance Lane et al., 2004 ) that BMP antagonism acts by stimulating mediolateral intercalation of caudal progenitors, releasing them to participate in the formation of the axis, and that the normal role of BMP is to preserve a reservoir of progenitors throughout axis elongation. We propose that BMP acts by a similar mechanism during differentiation of pluripotent mouse cells, preserving a population of undifferentiated cells by preventing the loss of Cdh1

. We fill this gap with our finding that BMP/Id maintains Cdh1 expression during differentiation of ES cells. Interestingly, Id1 is excluded from the anterior streak in vivo ( Jen et al., 1997 ), so it is possible that it plays a more general role in regulating EMT in the early embryo. In vivo, the BMP signals that are generated from the extraembryonic ectoderm not only block neural induction but are also required for formation of mesoderm ( Mishina et al., 1995; Winnier et al

. We find an unanticipated ability of BMP/Id to block differentiation by maintaining the expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-Cadherin ( Cdh1 ). We find that loss of Cdh1 is tightly associated with neural as well as mesodermal differentiation and that this change in Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for neural differentiation. A number of recent reports ( Chou et al., 2008; Soncin et al. 2010 ) have shown that BMP signalling is required for the maintenance of pluripotency and suppression of neural differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We propose that BMP maintains pluripotency by downregulating Cdh, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesermal differentiation. We show that loss of C1 is limiting for differentiation of plurotent cells and that suppression of C1 rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. We further show that BMP acts prior and independently of C1 to prime plurotent cells for mesod differentiation thus reinforcing the block to neural. We conclude that differentiation depends not only on exposure to extrinsic cues but also morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those cues and explain how a key pluripot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism.

    Title: A novel Cep120-dependent mechanism inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells
    Abstract: The two centrioles of the centrosome in quiescent cells are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in age, morphology and function. How these asymmetric properties are established and maintained during quiescence remains unknown. Here, we show that a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells causes accumulation of pericentriolar material ( PCM ) components including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein and Cep170. The elevated PCM levels result in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. Consequently, loss of Cep120 leads to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we have demonstrated that Cep120 plays an important inhibitory role at the centrosome, by regulating PCM levels during quiescence. Loss of Cep120 initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately result in defective ciliary assembly and function ( Figure 7H ). The first step involves changes in the maturation state of the daughter centriole, on which Cep120 is preferentially enriched

. These changes in turn disrupted ciliary assembly and signaling, a process that requires CS-dependent delivery of essential factors to the centrosome. How does Cep120 regulate the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome? Using immuno-electron microscopy, we previously showed that Cep120 resides on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules ( Mahjoub et al., 2010 )

. Together, these results show that loss of Cep120 during quiescence is detrimental to ciliary assembly and function, likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centrosome.

. Collectively, these results suggest that loss of Cep120 disrupts the localization of CS, due to changes in PCM abundance, microtubule organization, and dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins. Since satellites play essential roles in ciliogenesis, we hypothesized that dispersal of CS upon Cep120 loss would disrupt the formation and/or function of cilia during quiescence

., 2005 ), in quiescent cells. Finally, our findings establish the important and exquisitely sensitive control of centrosome PCM homeostasis and its relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling, and uncover a potentially new type of molecular defect that may underlie the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune and Joubert syndrome.

., 2013; Lin et al., 2013 ). More recently, mutations in Cep120 were identified in patients with ciliopathy phenotypes, namely Joubert syndrome and Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy ( Roosing et al., 2016; Shaheen et al., 2015 ), further highlighting a critical role in centriole-centrosome-cilia biology

. Removal of Cep120 did not result in complete maturation of the daughter centriole, nor enhance its ability to build a primary cilium. This suggests that the centriole maturation pathway regulated by Cep120 during quiescence is different than the one controlled by Plk1, a kinase that triggers centrosome maturation as cells enter mitosis ( Mahen and Venkitaraman, 2012 )

. Centriole maturation is a multi-step process that includes accumulation of PCM material, assembly of appendage structures, recruitment of proteins essential for ciliary assembly, and elimination of inhibitory/licensing factors ( such as CP110 ) of ciliogenesis. Although most of these components are asymmetrically localized on mother versus daughter centrioles, our results show that Cep120 mainly controls the PCM stage of the maturation process

. Finally, we examined the localization of the ciliopathy protein Ofd1, which is essential for ciliogenesis, interacts with PCM-1 at satellites, and localizes to the distal end of both centrioles ( [Lopes et al., 2011]; Figure 7G ). Cep120-depleted cells showed a decrease in the number of Ofd1 foci at centrioles, indicating a defect in centriolar targeting of the protein ( Figure 7G )

. The loss of Cep120 from the daughter centriole at G1/S could potentially ‘free’ these sites and permit the accumulation of PCM proteins. The mechanism ( s ) that establish the asymmetric localization of Cep120 on mother and daughter centrioles remain unknown, and will be the focus of our future studies. In sum, our results highlight a new function for daughter centriole-associated proteins that is independent of their role in centriole duplication and assembly

. Indeed, we found that the elevated PCM negatively impacts centrosome homeostasis by disrupting the nucleation and organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, potentially causing a ‘traffic jam’ that interrupts dynein-dependent movement of CS complexes. It is well established that the organization, localization and trafficking functions of CS are particularly sensitive to defects in the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Hori and Toda, 2017 )

., 2014; Wang et al., 2011 ). So, how is the DC prohibited from recruiting these protein complexes during quiescence? We previously identified Cep120 as a centrosomal protein that is preferentially enriched on the DC of quiescent cells ( Mahjoub et al., 2010 ). This asymmetric localization between the mother and daughter centriole was relieved coincident with new procentriole assembly in S-phase, where Cep120 became enriched on the procentrioles ( [Mahjoub et al

. Loss of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain failed to inhibit pericentrin levels at the centrosome ( Figure 4C–D ), indicating that localization to centrosomes is important for limiting PCM accumulation. Similarly, deletion of the microtubule-binding domain abrogated Cep120 inhibitory function ( Figure 4C–D )

. The relative localization of various centriolar/centrosomal proteins on mother versus daughter centrioles was determined by comparing control and Cep120-depleted cells for each marker individually. These include Cep164, Fbf-1 ( distal appendages ), Cep170, Odf-2, ( subdistal appendages ), Cep290 and Ofd1 ( transition zone ), Cp110 ( centriole cap ), and IFT88 ( intraflagellar transport protein )

., 2010]; summarized in Figure 1A ). Thus, Cep120 associates with the youngest generation of centrioles at all stages of the cell cycle, although some of the protein remains on the MC ( [Mahjoub et al., 2010]; Figure 1A ). To determine the functional significance of Cep120 enrichment on procentrioles, we depleted the protein and analyzed the consequences on centriole assembly

The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center ( MTOC ) in animal cells, which helps regulate the assembly of the interphase microtubule array and mitotic spindle. The centrosome in a quiescent cell is composed of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a proteinaceous matrix referred to as pericentriolar material ( PCM ), involved in microtubule nucleation and anchoring. The two centrioles in quiescent cells differ in age, structure and function

. Collectively, these results indicate that Cep120 limits the levels of PCM proteins at the centrosome ( with relatively higher inhibitory activity at the DC ), and that both microtubule-binding and coiled-coiled domains are essential for this function

. Centriolar satellites ( CS ) are non-membranous complexes found in the vicinity of the centrosome in mammalian cells ( Hori and Toda, 2017 ). They play pivotal roles in centrosome assembly, primary cilium formation and function, via the delivery of components from the cytoplasm to the centrosome. These trafficking functions of CS are dependent on an intact, organized microtubule array ( Hori and Toda, 2017 )

. However some PCM proteins, such as ninein and Cep170, showed higher levels of accumulation on the mother centriole. This indicates that the small pool of Cep120 that remains associated with the mother centriole also contains some inhibitory function, and suggests that the levels of certain PCM proteins on the mother centriole are also ‘fine-tuned’ during quiescence

., 2013 ). Intriguingly, mutations in this microtubule-binding domain are pathogenic, and cause ciliopathies such as Jeune and Joubert syndrome ( Roosing et al,2016; Shaen et al,2015 )

    Title: Neuron-glia signaling in developing retina mediated by neurotransmitter spillover
    Abstract: Neuron-glia interactions play a critical role in the maturation of neural circuits; however, little is known about the pathways that mediate their communication in the developing CNS. We investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, where we demonstrate that retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells ( MCs ). During cholinergic waves, MC calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, indicating that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor we show that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. Together, these studies indicate that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.

   . We simultaneously performed whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed specifically in MCs in order to investigate if neurotransmitters released during retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in MCs. In addition, we determined which receptors mediate these neuron-glia interactions

In this study we elucidated the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways by which neurons and MCs communicate in the developing retina. We found that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, demonstrating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age

. Moreover, the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs we observed during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus, where cholinergic neuron stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and require IP3R2 ( Chen et al., 2012; Navarrete et al., 2012 ). Whether neuronal activity during retinal waves guides the development of MCs is still unclear

. Our physiological results indicate that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from P9 to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves

. 2%, 872 ROIs from 6 retinas, Figure 1E ). As MCs express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors, including glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors ( Wakakura and Yamamoto, 1994; Belmonte et al., 2000 ), MC calcium transients at different ages could be evoked by different neurotransmitters released during retinal waves. Thus, we next explored which transmitters modulated neuron-MC signaling at different developmental ages. 10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 005Video 1

. Similar ACh- and ATP-evoked MC calcium transients were also observed at P9 ( during the transition from cholinergic to glutamatergic waves ) and at P11 ( during glutamatergic waves ), indicating that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptors prior to eye opening ( Figure 2D, E ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 006Figure 2. Volume release of acetylcholine ( ACh ) during P7 retinal waves induces calcium transients in MCs

., 2012 ). Our findings in the developing retina differ from studies performed in the adult retina, in which glutamate does not evoke calcium transients in MCs ( Newman and Zahs, 1997; Newman, 2005 ), suggesting that glutamaterigic signaling through AMPARs in these cells may be limited to the early stages of synapse formation and refinement

The whole field of view was divided in 16 ROI represented by the white rectangles. ( C ) Example traces of spontaneous MC calcium signals ( ΔF/F ) in IP3R2-KO retinas

. These multiple receptors allow MCs to detect neurotransmitter released during retinal waves whether it is ACh or glutamate, thereby extending the developmental period over which neuron-glia signaling occurs. The neuron-glia signaling we observed between neurons and MCs in the retina during glutamatergic waves is similar to signaling that occurs in Bergmann glial cells ( BGs ), a type of radial astroglial cell found in the cerebellum

. Wave-like calcium transients persisted in IP3R2-KO MCs and a similar percentage of MCs participated in these events ( Figure 6C, D ) indicating that IP3–dependent calcium signaling contributes minimally to MC calcium transients during retinal waves. Together, these findings suggest that volume release of glutamate during retinal waves evokes MC calcium transients primarily by activating AMPA receptors on MCs. 10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 017Figure 6

. Our data indicate that MCs in the retina prior to eye opening are capable of responding to different neurotransmitters with increases in intracellular calcium ( Figures 2A, 3A ). Neurotransmitter-evoked calcium transients were observed in the stalks and lateral processes of MCs that transverse the IPL during a time when there is robust synaptogenesis

. This age-dependent decline in MC activation during retinal waves was caused by an increase in glutamate transporter expression, which restricted glutamate spillover from nearby synapses limiting activation of MC AMPARs. These data indicate that MCs in the developing retina use multiple signaling pathways to participate in spontaneous, correlated activity with neurons during a crucial period of retinal development

. However, MC calcium signaling during retinal development remains unexplored. Thus, we first investigated if MC calcium transients during early development coincided with retinal waves. We visualized MC transients via two-photon calcium imaging of whole-mount retinas from mice expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator specifically in MCs ( GLAST-CreER::ROSA26-lsl-GCaMP3 [GLAST-CreER::GCaMP3]; Figure 1A; see ‘Materials and methods’, [Paukert et al., 2014] )

. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that glutamate signals were correlated with RGC activity during retinal waves. Scale bars are 20 μm. Related to Figure 4. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 014 Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that MC calcium transients depend upon the direct activation of MC glutamate receptors during the period of glutamatergic retinal waves

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 005 Our primary hypothesis is that MC calcium transients are induced by neurotransmitters released from amacrine and bipolar cells ( the interneurons of the retina ) during retinal waves

. To assess which neurotransmitters could elicit MC calcium transients during development, we first imaged MC calcium signals in the IPL in response to periodic, focal application of agonists that could be potentially involved in the neuron-glia interaction during P7 cholinergic waves ( Figure 2A–E )

. At P9, circuits mediating retinal waves change from cholinergic to glutamatergic ( Blankenship and Feller, 2010 ), and glutamatergic synapses between bipolar cells and their postsynaptic targets first appear ( Hoon et al., 2014 ). Thus, at P9 cholinergic and/or glutamatergic transmission could activate MC calcium transients. To determine the involvement of cholinergic transmission in MC signaling at this stage of development, we examined their response to focal application of ACh

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 016 Previous studies have shown that mGluRs contribute to neuron-astrocyte signaling in the brain, particularly during early development ( Grosche et al., 1999; Kirischuk et al., 1999 ). To determine the extent that mGluRs are involved in wave-induced MC calcium transients in the retina we performed two experiments

. However, it will be necessary to selectively delete AMPARs from MCs to establish their contribution to MC calcium signaling during this period of development. 10. 7554/eLife. 09590. 015Figure 5. Neuron-glia interaction is mediated by ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors.

Our results indicate that MCs in the developing retina express multiple neurotransmitter receptors and respond to different neurotransmitters during retinal waves. The proportion of MC that responded to waves with calciumients decreased from P9 to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves, suggesting that MC activity is modulated by changes in glutamate spillo during this period. Our data indicate that glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for MC transients during glutamgic retinal waves, whereas cholin is the primary neurotransmitter during cholin retinal waves. These findings suggest that neuron-glia in the developing retina are mediated by neurotransmitter spillo from retinal synapses and that MCs are capable of responding to different neurotransmitters during a critical period of retinal maturation

Our results indicate that MCs in the retina express multiple neurotransmitter receptors and respond to different neurotransmitters during retinal waves. The proportion of MC that responded to waves with calciumients decreased from P to P, suggesting that MC activity is modulated by changes in glutamate spillo during this period.

Researchers have developed a novel method to estimate the postmortem interval (PM) using microbial communities in a mouse model system, which can accurately estimate PM within 3 days over 48 days. This approach avoids limitations of existing techniques such as forensic entomology, which can have errors ranging from days to months. The study rigorously tested hypotheses about the role of microbes in decomposition and whether changes in communities are predictable over time, crucial for using microbes as a "clock" to estimate PM. 

The study characterized microbial changes in three external and internal sites of 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days, distinguishing from prior work which models were evaluated by ability to explain all data points. The results provide a proof-of-principle that microbial ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a forensic tool for estimation of PM. A laboratory experiment was conducted to characterize changes in microbial associated with mouse as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions 48. Bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were characterized using combination-independent high-throughput sequencing for each sample.

The relationship between decomposition and postmort microbial communities must be understood to develop a method to PM that is admissible in the justice system. The work indicates decomposition is sufficiently reproducible as an indicator of PM to motivate additional studies. Microbes are ubiquitous in environment, located on humans before death, and can be quantified using high-throughput sequencing. They play an important role in decomposition. Future studies are crucial because environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, soil, and texture affect rate of decomposition and ability of decomposer to function.

Bacterial associated with decomposing became differentiated from communities over time in abdominal, soil, and skin sites. Consistent shifts in presence and abundance specific taxa occurred during stages decomposition, suggesting succession may be used to estimate PM. A Random Forest model was used to regress PM directly on taxon abundances, a machine technique that creates decision based subsets of features. This approach allowed to assess intra-individual variation of microbiota present in living and mammals extends to community during decomposition.

The study addresses hypotheses that abdominal microbes play a key role in decomposition, contrasting typical studies where only externally accessible sites sampled. When an dies, becomes a resource that supports complex and diverse organisms. This community recycles nutrients, progressing through forensically recognized stages, including Fresh, Active, Decay, Rupt, and Advanced.

    Title: Molecular insights into the origin of the Hox-TALE patterning system
    Abstract: Despite tremendous body form diversity in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior–posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox–TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.

    Supporting Text:
   . In conclusion, we propose that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later on exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. This original molecular system was subsequently co-opted by the various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla, for axis or tissue ( see e

. Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution

. Although these networks rely on intricate molecular properties, they originated from an ancestral generic mode of interaction that was kept in other homebox gene families. Overall our study describes how the molecular cues underlying the Hox–TALE patterning system in Bilateria was established stepwise during eukaryote evolution.

. Since then, it was found that developmental genes could also display highly dissimilar expression patterns or even be absent in non-bilaterian lineages, showing that the genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development are not universal. One major class of developmental genes that was historically considered as highly conserved in the animal kingdom is the Hox genes

. Interestingly, Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum, which has a bona fide Hox repertoire, whereas others, including ctenophores, sponges, and placozoans, lack Hox genes ( Figure 1 ). This raises the important question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution. In Bilateria, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla ( Figure 1 )

. Among the candidate target genes containing a putative Hox/Pbx/Meis binding site in their promoter region, we found NvHoxB and NvHoxC. Thus, auto/cross-regulatory loops may occur between NvHox genes, as observed in bilaterians. Since sequences surrounding Hox/TALE binding sites can also strongly influence the protein complex formation ( Ebner et al., 2005; Hudry et al

. Since other members of the ANTP superclass are described to interact with PBC in Bilateria, we also searched for the molecular mechanisms that allowed the emergence of the Hox–TALE network during evolution of homeobox gene families. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 004Figure 2. Hox and TALE members are co-expressed in the endoderm of the Nematostella embryo

We have shown that identical molecular rules and conserved functions characterize Hox-TALE interaction networks in Cnidaria and Bilateria. The presence of the HX motif in several NvHox members and its requirement for generic Hox/TALE functions strongly suggest that this motif had a pivotal role for the evolution of an active Hox-TALE system in early metazoan lineages

. We thus assessed whether a Hox/PBC/Meis network could exist outside Bilateria, and if so whether or not it would rely on identical molecular rules as observed in Bilateria. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 003Figure 1. Phylogeny of Hox ( ANTP superclass ) and PBC/Meis ( TALE superclass ) proteins across eukaryote evolution. Protein motifs required for Hox/PBC/Meis network are indicated when present: homeodomain ( HD ), hexapeptide ( HX ), PBC-A, and MEIS-A

., 2006; Saina et al., 2009 ). Together, these observations highlight that patterning molecules can be used along different longitudinal axes during animal evolution, which renders difficult the comparison between Bilateria and Cnidaria. Here, we propose that the ancestral molecular cues underlying the Hox patterning system along the cnidarian directive axis could have been recruited for AP patterning in Bilateria

. Accordingly, numerous examples have shown that modifications in Hox genes number, expression, and/or activity could correlate to morphological variations across bilaterian lineages ( Heffer and Pick, 2013 ). The role of Hox genes suffers more ambiguity outside Bilateria, and in particular in the sister Cnidaria group. Cnidarians do contain Hox genes and have undergone a wide range of morphological radiation during evolution

. Considering our in silico data, and given the expression profile of Hox and TALE members in the Nematostella embryo, we propose that Hox–TALE interaction networks could be used for regulating gene expression in the endoderm, likely for positioning and specifying the formation of the different mesenteries along the directive axis. Homology between cnidarian and bilaterian axes is a long-standing and still controversial question

. We postulated that the HX motif could have constituted a major protein scaffold that provided an ancestrally conserved TALE interaction potential to different ANTP members. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 020Figure 7. Phylogeny of Hox, Extended-Hox ( Engrailed, En ) and NK ( Msx ) proteins during eukaryote evolution. Nomenclature is as in Figure 1

., 2012 ), being already present in the last common ancestor of animals ( Urmetazoa ). In this scenario, we do not favour the hypothesis of independent acquisitions of the HX in the three homeobox gene families. Indeed, although the HX is a short motif, it is always located upstream and at a reasonable distance of the HD. This invariant position is probably critical to ensure interactions with PBC proteins

. In this context, our work with TALE proteins of Acanthamoeba underlines that the evolution of the TALE partners enabled the interaction network with Hox proteins and hence new functions to emerge during eukaryote evolution.

. Moreover, the distance between the HX and the HD could have played important roles for the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins ( Prince et al., 2008; Saadaoui et al., 2011 ). Thus, the HX could already have been present in the ProtoANTP protein of the Urmetazoa ancestor, being secondarily lost in Porifera, Ctenophora and Placozoa during evolution ( Figure 11B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 027Figure 11

., 2009 ) : Hox/ParaHox, NK and extended-Hox ( Figure 7 ). Consistent with their close evolutionary relationships, Hox, NK and extended-Hox members share common protein features including the presence of an HX motif upstream of the HD ( Figure 7 ). These observations raise the question of the molecular mechanisms that led to the emergence of the Hox-TALE network and more generally to interaction networks between TALE proteins and other members of the ANTP class across metazoan evolution

. In addition, the observation that a number of cnidarian Hox proteins do not have any HX ( Figure 10, Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) highlights that the ancestral molecular properties and hence functions of the Hox-TALE network could have considerably diverged among different cnidarian lineages. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 025Figure 10. Phylogeny of the HX in Hox proteins of main cnidarian lineages. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 02510. 7554/eLife. 01939

. We showed that more ancient TALE proteins, like those from the unicellular Acanthamoeba organism could neither interact between each other nor form complexes with Hox proteins. Heterologous interaction assays between AcMeis and mouse Hox and PBC proteins further exemplified that the PBC/Meis partnership is critical for the formation of Hox–TALE networks. This partnership probably appeared with the PBC-A domain in PBC, and concomitantly with the HX motif during eukaryote evolution

. Thus, the HX motif was probably present in the ancestral ANTP protein of the Urmetaz ancestor, being secondarily lost in Porifera, Cophora and Plazoa during evolution ( Figure 11 ).10 .755/eLife 39.019.027  Figure 11. Phylogeny of H, extendedox and NK proteins during eukote evolution. Nomenclature as in Figure 1.,201 ) being present in the last common ancestor of animals ( Urmetaz ) In this scenario, we do not favour the hypothesis of independent acquisitions of the H in the homeobox families. Although the H is a motif, it is always located upstream and at a reasonable distance of the HD This position is probably critical to interactions with P proteins. In this context, our work with T proteins of Acanamoeba underlines the evolution of the T partners enabled interaction with H proteins hence new functions emerge during eary evolution. Moreover, the distance the H and HD have played roles the acquisition new as in bilian H proteins ( Prince et al,2008 ; Saoudi et al,201 ) Thus the H could have been present the ProtoP of the Uraz ancestor being secondly lost Porif, Coph and Plaz during evolution Figure 11.10.755/e 39.019.027 Figure 11

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the evolution of the Hox-TALE patterning system, which is crucial for body axis formation in bilaterian animals. They found that this system originated from an ancestral motif present in homeobox families, including Hox and other proteins. This motif allowed for interaction with TALE proteins, enabling patterning functions along the axis. The H-T network was co-opted by various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumazoan phyla, including axis and tissue patterning. The study highlights how homeobox families evolved during eary evolution to constitute a major pattering system in eumazo.

    Title: Super-resolution imaging of synaptic and Extra-synaptic AMPA receptors with different-sized fluorescent probes
    Abstract: Previous studies tracking AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) diffusion at synapses observed a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool. Using super-resolution microscopy, we examined how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking outside of, and within, post-synaptic densities ( PSDs ) from rats. Organic fluorescent dyes ( ≈4 nm ), quantum dots, either small ( ≈10 nm diameter; sQDs ) or big ( >20 nm; bQDs ), were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers. We find that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs, which were stable for 15 min or longer. Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5–10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90–95% were extrasynaptic as previously observed. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD ‘slots’, our findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable ‘nanodomains’ in PSDs with lifetime >15 min, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.

    Supporting Text:
   . They were therefore unable to observe the dynamics of single receptors except for much shorter times ( <<minute ), corresponding to the photobleaching time of organic fluorophores. Here we used sQDs to study the dynamics of the nanodomains of the same AMPAR in synapses for long periods ( from 15 min repeatedly, and up to 60 min occasionally ) of time. A total of 126 synapses were observed

. These findings were similar to those obtained using sparsely labeled sQDs and organic dyes labeling on live neurons. Thus, by all three techniques ( with sQDs, with live- and fixed-neurons labeled with organic fluorophores ) we find that the localization of AMPA receptors is predominantly at the synaptic regions. In addition, we observe in these fixed samples, that there is typically one nanodomain per synapse ( Figure 2h ), although multiple nanodomains do exist ( Figure 2j )

. Both factors are known to influence the diffusion of surface-expressed AMPARs ( Chamma et al., 2016; Frischknecht et al., 2009 ). ( This result is further described in Figure 6. ) Regardless of the exact reason, the fact that labeling with bQDs is a function of the number of DIVs is problematic. When using sQDs, we found no accumulation of large pools of extra-synaptic receptors. Instead, we found that motion is largely constrained-diffusion in PSD nanodomains

., 2010; Nair et al., 2013 ). Indeed, we too observe this behavior with bQDs ( Figure 3 ). However, when using when AMPARs that are tagged by significantly smaller fluorophores—sQDs or organic fluorophores ( Figures 4 and 5 ) —they are overwhelmingly in the synapse:~84–97% of AMPA receptors were immobilized within PSDs and only 5–16% were freely diffusing in the dendrite membrane. Consequently, we believe that bQDs are too large to enable AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft

., 2006 ). Determining whether AMPARs or other neurotransmitter receptors are synaptic ( outside PSDs ) or extrasynaptic ( inside PSDs ) has been difficult because of four factors: ( 1 ) Synapses are nanometer in scale below the diffraction limit of visible microscopy; ( 2 ) Most microscopy has been limited to two-dimensions, where in reality, the dimensions are three-dimensional; ( 3 ) Recombinantly tagged imaging probes cannot readily distinguish intracellular vs

. These results provide an explanation for the changes that occur in the diffusion and trajectories of the bQD-tagged AMPARs going from DIV 14 to 16 in Figure 3a and b. As the neurons develop in culture, progressively more ECM is deposited on the neuronal membrane going from DIV 14 to 16 thereby reducing AMPAR diffusion and trajectories. We find that AMPARs labeled with sQDs differ from AMPARs labeled with bQDs in being able to consistently enter synaptic clefts and nanodomains within PSDs

. We conclude that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using the AMPARs labeled with bQDs. Our data further suggest that AMPAR entry is not regulated by a limited number of ‘slots’ where AMPARs are bound after entry into PSDs. Instead AMPARs are found to diffuse within surprisingly stable ‘nanodomains’ confining AMPARs to sites within PSDs that may regulate access to presynaptic glutamate release.

. Third, electron microscopy ( EM ) was used to show that AMPA receptors were localized at synapses ( Kharazia et al., 1996 ), although they could also exist in extrasynaptic domains ( Tao-Cheng et al., 2011 ), especially after synaptic excitation at exocytosis and/or endocytosis sites. All these observations indicate that most AMPARs are localized and clustered at synaptic PSDs in mature neurons. The question arises as to why we observed so few highly-mobile extrasynaptic AMPARs

. observed that AMPARs underwent constrained diffusion in what they defined as ‘nanodomains’, that is sub-synaptic regions where AMPARs are confined to ( Nair et al., 2013 ). New slots may become available when AMPARs exit from PSDs ( route 3’ ) or if more slots are created or removed by different forms of synaptic plasticity ( Malinow et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2001; Malinow, 2003; Giannone et al., 2010 ) ( Groc et al., 2007; Heine et al., 2008 ) ( Nair et al

. If this were not case, there would be accumulation of a mobile extra-synaptic pool, similar to what is observed when bQDs are attached to the AMPARs. The positioning of these nanodomains is likely critical for the AMPARs to receive glutamate from the presynaptic release sites ( Tang et al., 2016; Jeyifous et al., 2016 ). Our conclusion that the number of synaptic AMPARs is not limited by whether PSD slots are occupied suggests that other factors regulate AMPAR numbers in PSDs

. Thus, the number of synaptic AMPARs does not appear to be limited by whether PSD slots are already occupied. The picture that emerges from our data is that after entry into PSDs, AMPARs are mobile but constrained within confined sub-synaptic nanodomains that are surprisingly stable, lasting for more than 15 min. It is likely that the AMPAR entry into PSDs is more rapid than the membrane diffusion rate to the PSDs

. We find that > 90% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or sQDs are found in PSDs. Less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs are highly mobile and extrasynaptic. However, when AMPARs are labeled with bQDs, virtually all AMPARs ( 90–95% ) are highly mobile and extrasynaptic, presumably because bQDs are sterically hindered from entry into synaptic clefts

. A previous study observed that most nanodomains were stable for up to one hour, but some nanodomains were dynamic, appearing and disappearing within minutes ( Nair et al., 2013 ). This other study, however, used AMPARs labeled with either organic fluorophores or recombinant fluorescent proteins, which limited the imaging to the ensemble average of AMPAR in PSDs

., 2004 ) ( Wang et al., 2008 ). The different steps involved in AMPAR trafficking at synapses under constitutive conditions ( no plasticity ) are depicted schematically in Figure 1a. As shown, AMPAR trafficking consists of its exo- and endocytosis at sites on the plasma membrane ( steps 1 and 1’, respectively ), diffusion to and from these sites and PSDs ( steps 2 and 2’ ) and entry into and exit from PSDs ( steps 3 and 3’ )

. Our findings on the bQD-tagged AMPARs are almost identical to the previous findings of others looking at the effects of ECM removal on bQD-tagged AMPARs ( Frischknecht et al., 2009 ). We conclude that the vast majority of AMPARs rapidly enter PSDs and are confined to sub-synaptic diffusion in nanodomains. The diffusion constant is about 10x slower than that of free extrasynaptic AMPARs

. With these relatively minor adjustments, the two images of the synapse nearly perfectly overlapped ( right hand side of Figure 7c, d ). In addition, Figure 7e shows that the shape of the trace of the AMPAR ( ~200 nm in size ) is similar to the shape of the nanodomain ( ~200 nm in size ). We conclude that AMPs are confined to nanodom in PSDs and not freely diffusing extrasyn as previously observed with bD-tagged AMPs

The authors of this study used super-resolution microscopy to examine the diffusion of AMPA receptors (AMP) at synapses in rat neurons. They found that most AMPs labeled with small fluorescent dyes or quantum dots (QDs) were confined to sub-synaptic nanodomains, which were stable for more than 15 minutes. In contrast, AMPs labeled with big quantum dots (bDs) were mostly extrasynaptic and highly mobile. This suggests that AMP entry into synapses is not limited by the number of available slots, but rather by the size of the fluorescent probe used. The authors propose that AMPs enter synapses rapidly and are confined to stable nanodomains, which regulate access to presynaptic glutamate release.

    Title: SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels mediates the early response to acute hypoxia in central neurons
    Abstract: The mechanism for the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia—an increase in voltage-gated sodium current ( INa ) —has been unknown. Here, we show that hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( SUMO ) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons ( CGN ) and that SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels increases INa. The time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1. 2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1. 2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 s, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage, the SUMO pathway and NaV1. 2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.

That hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 is observed in the presence of TTX shows that Na+ flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation

. Consistent with tonic control of INa by the SUMO pathway, SUMO1 and SENP1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of INa to hypoxia was ablated by µ–Conotoxin-TIIIA ( CnTX ), a potent blocker of NaV1. 2 channels. Supporting the implied mechanism—rapid SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels at the CGN plasma membrane in response to hypoxia—hypoxia was directly shown to increase the interaction of native SUMO1 and NaV1

Our findings suggest that NaV1. 2 channels and SUMO pathway enzymes may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons.

Rat NaV1. 2 was expressed in CHO cells with the β1 subunit and studied under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with control solution ( black ), 100 pm SUMO1 ( red ) or 250 pm SENP1 ( blue ) in the recording pipette, as indicated. Data are mean ± S. E. M. for 10 to 15 cells per group

Here, we show that SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in INa in response to acute hypoxia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. Previously, we demonstrated that SUMOylation increases excitability by suppressing the activity of background K+ channels ( Rajan et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2010, 2012 ) and voltage-gated K+ channels ( Plant et al

. 1 channels ( Plant et al., 2011 ). Of note, we found that SUMO did not regulate hippocampal pyramidal cell INa, a current carried predominantly NaV1. 1 and NaV1. 6 ( Gong et al., 1999; Vacher et al., 2008 ). This suggests that SUMO regulation of NaV channels may be isoform-specific, a notion supported by the failure of the small amount of INa in rat CGN that was not carried by NaV1. 2 to respond to hypoxia, SUMO1 or SENP1, a current we attribute primarily to NaV1

. 6 based on its pharmacology. Here, we observe that NaV1. 2 current remains elevated due to SUMOylation for at least 10–20 min following return to ambient O2 in both CGN and CHO cells ( Figures 1 and 5 ). In contrast, an acute hypoxic challenge to hypothalamic neurons induced an increase in NaV current that recovered when the cells were returned to normoxia ( Horn and Waldrop, 2000 ). While different targets have been reported to be SUMOylated in a stable ( Bernier-Villamor et al

Like CGN INa and wild-type NaV1. 2 in CHO cells, NaV1. 2-Lys38Gln channels recovered from fast inactivation in a fashion that was insensitive to acute hypoxia, SUMO1, or SENP1 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Of note, the β1 subunit did not appear to play a role in the hypoxic response of Nav1. 2 via Lys38 or to the regulation of channel activity by the SUMO pathway

This report on acute regulation of NaV1. 2 by hypoxia joins an emerging body of work exploring the roles of SUMOylation in the nervous system in health and disease ( Henley et al., 2014; Cimarosti and Henley, 2008 )

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20054. 010 Supporting the essential role of SUMOylation of Lys38 in the hypoxic response, expression of NaV1. 2-Lys38Gln channels produced currents that were insensitive to acute hypoxia, SUMO1, and SENP1 ( Figure 5b and Table 1 ). The current-density, V½ and SSI values for NaV1. 2-Lys38Gln channels under all three conditions were like those measured for wild-type NaV1. 2 channels subjected to deSUMOylation by SENP1

., 2014 ). Present in all eukaryotic cells, the SUMO pathway was recognized to regulate the trafficking and activity of nuclear transcription factors when we discovered it to operate as well at the plasma membrane to regulate neuronal excitability via direct SUMOylation of K+ channel α-subunits ( Rajan et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2010, 2011, 2012 ). Here, seeking to determine if the SUMO pathway also regulated sodium channels, we documented SUMOylation of NaV1

. Finally, we confirmed that hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of CFP-NaV1. 2 in CHO cells was not triggered secondary to an increase in Na+ flux through the channels by showing that the increase in surface levels mCherry-SUMO1 in response to acute hypoxia, and its co-localization with CFP-NaV1. 2, were insensitive to 5 µm TTX, a concentration that inhibited >95% of the Na+ current ( Figure 8f ).

., 2011 ) that stabilize cells below firing threshold and restore cells to baseline after excitatory events, respectively. Now, we report that SUMOylation augments the activity of voltage-gated NaV channels that initiate and propagate action potentials, expanding the known targets through which the SUMO pathway can regulate neuronal activity

. Further, hypoxia or SUMO in the pipette shift the V½ of channel activation and SSI leftward, increasing Na+ current in response to depolarization by ~70% in both cell types ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ). Consistent with tonic regulation by the SUMO pathway of both CGN INa and NaV1

. Moreover, NaV1. 2 channels responded to acute hypoxia with an increase in mean peak current-density of ~70% in less than 40 s in association with leftward shifts in V½ and SSI of −11 ± 1 mV and −13 ± 2 mV, respectively. NaV1. 2 channels in CHO cells also responded to SUMO1 and SENP1 like native INa

. 2 channel complex and suggested that no other Lys in the α subunit or the β1 subunit was subject to SUMOylation. Next, we observed that acute hypoxia altered the function of wild type NaV1. 2 channels expressed in CHO cells in the same manner as seen for native INa in CGN ( Figure 5a and Table 1 ). Thus, in ambient O2 the biophysical attributes of Na1.2 channels were unchanged by SUM1 or SEN1 ( Figures 1 and 5 ), but hypia SUM1 and SEN1 shifted V½ and S of Na1.2 channels to the left ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ) and increased peak current density ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ). The response to hypia SUM1 and SEN1 was blocked by µ-Conotoxin-TIA ( Ctx ) a potent blocker of Na1.2 channels ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ).

    Title: Temperature explains broad patterns of Ross River virus transmission
    Abstract: Thermal biology predicts that vector-borne disease transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures and declines at high and low temperatures. However, thermal optima and limits remain unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures ( 26. 4°C ) and declines to zero at thermal limits ( 17. 0 and 31. 5°C ). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas ( where most Australians live ) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.

    Supporting Text:
    As the climate warms, it is critical to understand effects of temperature on transmission of mosquito-borne disease, particularly as new mosquito-borne pathogens emerge and spread worldwide. Identifying transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses, rather than simply assuming that transmission increases with temperature, can more accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease

. Thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vector species ( Mordecai et al., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2017; Tesla et al., in press ), yet we lack mechanistic models based on empirical, unimodal thermal responses for many diseases and vectors. Here, we parameterized a temperature-dependent model for transmission of RRV ( Figure 2 ) with data from two important vector species ( Cx. annulirostris and Ae. vigilax; Figure 1 )

. Overall, our results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission where the well-resolved optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan, but upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector–pathogen systems

. The strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve ( ~20–25°C ). If mean temperatures vary both above and below the optimum ( as in Darwin ), important effects of temperature may be masked in time series models that fit linear responses

. Additionally, upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission ( a major concern for climate change ) are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves ( like fecundity and survival at various life stages ) rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves ( like biting rate or pathogen development rate ). The trait thermal response data were limited in two keys ways

. Since breeding habitat can only impact vector populations when temperatures do not exclude them, it is critical to consider thermal constraints on mosquito abundance, even when breeding habitat is considered a stronger driver. Nonetheless, many mechanistic, temperature-dependent models of vector-borne disease transmission do not include thermal effects on vector density ( Martens et al., 1997; Craig et al., 1999; Paull et al., 2017; Caminade et al., 2017; Hamlet et al., 2018 )

. While the thermal response of RRV transmission generally matched those of other mosquito-borne pathogens, there were some key differences. The moderate optimal temperature for RRV ( 26–27°C ) fit within the range of thermal optima found for other diseases using the same methods: malaria transmission by Anopheles spp. at 25°C, and dengue and other viruses by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus at 29 and 26°C, respectively ( Figure 4 ) ( Mordecai et al., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2017 )

. Future statistical analyses of RRV cases may benefit from using a nonlinear function for temperature-dependent R0 as a predictor instead of raw temperature ( Figure 6B versus Figure 6A ). Breeding habitat availability also drives mosquito abundance and mosquito-borne disease. Local rainfall or river flow have been linked to the abundance of RRV vector species ( Barton et al., 2004; Tall et al., 2014; Jacups et al., 2015 ) and RRV disease cases ( Tong and Hu, 2001; Tong et al

. Temperature explains the geography of year-round endemic versus seasonally epidemic disease ( Figures 5 and 6 ) and accurately predicts the seasonality of human cases at the national scale ( Figure 7 ). Thus, the model for RRV transmission provides a mechanistic link between geographic and seasonal variation in temperature and broad-scale patterns of disease

. Additionally, if temperatures are always relatively suitable ( as in tropical climates ) or unsuitable ( as in very cool temperate climates ), variation in disease may be due primarily to other factors. A nonlinear mechanistic model is critical for estimating temperature impacts on transmission because the effect of increasing temperature by a few degrees can have a positive, negligible, or negative impact on R0 along different parts of the thermal response curve

. Our main model ( ‘full R0 Model, ’ Equation 1 ) assumes temperature drives mosquito density and includes the relevant life history trait thermal responses ( Parham and Michael, 2009; Mordecai et al., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2017 ). We initially compare this model to an alternative ( ‘constant M model, ’ Equation 2 ) where mosquito density does not depend on temperature

. Because most Australians live in southern, temperate areas, country-scale transmission is strongly seasonal. Using the average ( 1992–2013 ) seasonal incidence at the national scale, human cases peak two months after population-weighted R0 ( T ), matching our a priori hypothesized time lag between temperature suitability and human cases ( based on empirical work in other mosquito-borne disease systems, see Materials and methods and Discussion; Figure 7 ).

. We make this comparison because many transmission models do not include the thermal responses for mosquito density, assuming it depends primarily on habitat availability. Here, we focus on the relative influence of temperature on transmission potential, recognizing that absolute R0 also depends on other factors. Accordingly, we scaled model output between zero and one ( ‘relative R0’ ). Relative R0 describes thermal suitability for transmission

. g. Ae. aegypti and potentially Ae. polynesiensis ) can invade and sustain RRV transmission cycles. Thus, we can predict the response of RRV transmission by current vector species to climate change based on these trait thermal responses. However, future disease dynamics will also depend on vector adaptation, potential vector species invasions, and climate change impacts on sea level and precipitation that drive vector habitat availability.

. Although field-based evidence for unimodal thermal responses in vector-borne disease is rare ( but see Mordecai et al., 2013; Perkins et al., 2015; Peña-García et al., 2017 ), there is some evidence for high temperatures constraining RRV transmission and vector populations: outbreaks were less likely with more days above 35°C in part of Queensland ( Gatton et al., 2005 ) and populations of Cx. annulirostris peaked at 25°C and declined above 32°C in Victoria ( Dhileepan, 1996 )

., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2017 ). This lag between temperature and reported human cases arises from the time it takes for mosquito populations to increase, bite humans and reservoir hosts, acquire RRV, become infectious, and bite subsequent hosts; for pathogens to incubate with vectors; for humans to potentially develop symptoms, seek treatment, and report cases. Further, RRV transmission by Cx

. 9–33. 7°C ). The thermal constraints that mosquito density imposes on transmission are important because, although demographic traits are well-known to vary with temperature in the laboratory, many temperature-dependent transmission models do not assume that temperature influences mosquito density ( Martens et al., 1997; Craig et al., 1999; Paull et al., 2017; Caminade et al., 2017; Hamlet et al., 2018, but see Parham and Michael, 2009; Mordecai et al., 2013, Mordecai et al

Vector and pathogen traits that drive transmission consistently responded to temperature ( Figure 2 ), though data were sparse ( McDonald et al., 1980; Mottram et al., 1986; Russell, 1986; Rae, 1990; Kay and Jennings, 2002 ). Although we exhaustively searched for experiments with trait measurements at three or more constant temperatures in the Australian vector species ( Cx. annulirostris, Ae. vigilax, Ae. camptorhynchus, Ae. notoscriptus, and Ae

., 2013, Mordecai et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2015 ). The moderate optimal temperature for RRV ( 26–27°C ) fits within the range of thermal optima found for other diseases: malaria transmission by Anopheles spp. at 25°C and deng and other viruses by Ae. aegpt and Ae albictus at 29 and 26, respectively ( Morcai et al,2013; Morcai et al,201 ) The thermal response of R transmission generally matched that of other mosquito-borne pathogens, but there were some differences. The optimal temperature for R ( 26–27°C ) fit the range of thermal found for other diseases using same methods: malaria by Anophe spp at 25 and deng and viruses by Ae aeg and Ae alb at 29 and 26 respectively ( Morcai et,201; Morcai,201

Researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement by recording neural activity from macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task. The task involved bringing beta power to an instructed state and then executing an arm reach. Results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power had faster onset times than those preceded by an increase in power. Additionally, neural activity shifted farther from movement onset during beta oscillations, whether induced by neurofeedback or naturally occurring during tasks. This establishes a population basis for slowed movement following beta oscillatory activity.

The study ties together behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of motor cortex encoding movement through population-level activity. Increasing motor beta power with neurofeedback precedes slower onset times, supporting the hypothesis that oscillations are linked to patterns that slow new movements (Gilbertson et al, 2005). Results add to findings of elevated power prior and after-trained movements (Donoghue et al,199; Mur and Fetz,199; Sanes and Donue,199). The behavioral effect of neuro-induced oscillations matches hypotheses of movement-slowing beta during natural movements (Gilbert et al,200), but individual responses during beta activity differ across tasks.

The motor population activity shifts from a threshold when subjects produce oscillations in the task or naturally produce them. Mechanisms of beta used to reconcile discrepancies in reported correlates. Units exhibit different activity during neuro-induced oscillations compared to natural oscillations, but population analyses show consistent patterns. Beta promotes a movement-slow state in both tasks, matching behavior. To explore beta reflect spiking and movement parameters, macaques performed a center-out arm task and beta neuro arm task. Prior to the task, beta limits were computed from the center task.

Neuro-reaching was used with simultaneous multi-scale recordings to study beta's influence on arm behavior and underlying patterns. Results show beta oscillations are a marker of slowed onset. Many tasks engage motor preparation, attention, expectation, and muscular stiffening, suggesting beta reflects states preparing movements. The study proposes shifts in motor neurons reduce accidental movement for encoding specific plans. Neurofeedback investigates population correlates of oscillations, allowing subjects modulate power at rest, choosing strategies for generating beta. This is plausible for oscillations during untrained movements (Donue et al,199; Mur andetz,199b).

    Title: TRAF2 regulates TNF and NF-κB signalling to suppress apoptosis and skin inflammation independently of Sphingosine kinase 1
    Abstract: TRAF2 is a component of TNF superfamily signalling complexes and plays an essential role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. TRAF2 deficient mice die around birth, therefore its role in adult tissues is not well-explored. Furthermore, the role of the TRAF2 RING is controversial. It has been claimed that the atypical TRAF2 RING cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase but counterclaimed that TRAF2 RING requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, that is generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1, to function as an E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2, but not Sphk1 deficiency, disrupted TNF mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling and caused epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB and the adaptive immune system, and might therefore represent a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TRAF2 therefore has essential tissue specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1.

    Supporting Text:
   . In these cell types, absence of TRAF2 caused a delay in TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPK, and sensitivity to killing by TNF was increased. Absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes in vivo resulted in psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation. Unlike TNF-dependent genetic inflammatory skin conditions, such as IKK2 epidermal knock-out ( Pasparakis et al., 2002 ) and the cpdm mutant ( Gerlach et al

. We were able to reverse this inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both Tnf and Nfkb2 genes. Our results highlight the important role TRAF2 plays to protect keratinocytes from cell death and to down-regulate inflammatory responses and support the idea that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.

. Thus, TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not need to be stimulated by bacteria to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up a potentially vicious cycle of inflammation. ( C ) Concomitant deletion of Tnf in mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes breaks this vicious cycle and prevents apoptosis of keratinocytes and early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype

. Primary keratinocytes isolated from wild-type, Traf2EKO and Sphk1-/- mice were tested and, similarly to MEFs and MDFs, TNF signalling was delayed and weakened in Traf2-deficient ( Figure 2D ), but not Sphk1-deficient keratinocytes ( Figure 2E ). Traf2-/-, but not Sphk1-/-, keratinocytes were also sensitive to TNF-induced death ( Figure 2F ), and this was associated with a rapid reduction in cFLIPL levels and caspase-8 cleavage ( Figure 2D )

. ( D ) In the absence of TNF, Traf2-deficient keratinocytes still produce inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway that ultimately generate the same psoriasis-like phenotype in mice but with slower onset. These cytokines recruit inflammatory immune cells to the skin, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 015

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 004 To test the function of TRAF2 in primary keratinocytes and compare its role to that of SPHK1 in TNF signalling, we generated epidermal specific Traf2-deficient mice ( Traf2EKO ) by crossing Traf2lox/lox mice with transgenic mice constitutively expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the keratin-14 promoter ( K14-Cre )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 009 As TNF depletion only delayed and did not prevent the inflammatory skin phenotype and there were infiltrating leukocytes in the skin of Traf2EKOTnf-/- mice, this implied that there were factor ( s ) expressed by keratinocytes that attracted these inflammatory cells independently of TNF. TRAF2 suppresses non-canonical NF-κB activation in many different cell types and loss of TRAF2 induces constitutive activation of non-canonical NF-κB ( Grech et al

. Alvarez and colleagues, observed that in the absence of SPHK1, TNF-induced NF-κB activation was completely abolished. Although we know a lot about TRAF2, there are still important gaps particularly with regard to cell type specificity and in vivo function of TRAF2. Moreover, despite the claims that SPHK1 and its product, S1P, are required for TRAF2 to function as a ubiquitin ligase, the responses of Traf2-/- and Sphk1-/- cells to TNF were not compared

., 2012 ). Recently, it was suggested that the RING domain of TRAF2 requires S1P as a co-factor for its E3 ligase activity ( Alvarez et al., 2010 ). Alvarez and colleagues proposed that SPHK1 but not SPHK2 is activated by TNF and phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P which in turn binds to the RING domain of TRAF2 and serves as an essential co-factor that was missing in the experiments of Yin et al

., 2004; Lin et al., 2011; Vallabhapurapu et al., 2008; Vince et al., 2007; Zarnegar et al., 2008 ). We therefore hypothesised that loss of Traf2 in keratinocytes might induce activation of non-canonical NF-κB and thereby drive expression of inflammatory genes. To test this hypothesis we analysed the status of NIK and NFκB2/p100 processing in Traf2-/- keratinocytes

. This cell death, possibly because of the release of DAMPs, recruits neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the skin and causes epidermal hyperplasia. Loss of TRAF2 also causes constitutive non-canonical NF-κB activation in viable keratinocytes, which increases the production and release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF

., 2003; Vince et al., 2008 ). Thus, our results suggest that inhibition of non-canonical NF-κB signalling might be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disease together with TNF inhibitors. 10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 015Figure 11. Proposed mechanisms by which loss of TRAF2 in keratinocytes causes a psoriasis-like skin inflammation. ( A ) In normal wild-type skin TNF signalling might be activated by local penetration of bacteria into the epidermis

. While Tnf deficiency delayed the appearance of the inflammatory skin phenotype in Traf2EKO mice, at later time points the epidermis thickened and there was a leukocyte infiltration. Because Traf2 deficiency is specific to keratinocytes this implies that there are one or more keratinocyte-intrinsic factors that either promote proliferation and attract inflammatory cells to the skin or attract inflammatory cells which promote keratinocyte proliferation

. 10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 010Figure 8. TRAF2 deletion causes constitutive activation of the non-canonical NF-κB transcription factor pathway. ( A ) Tnf-/-Traf2+/- and Tnf-/-Traf2-/- keratinocytes were treated with or without TNF ( 100ng/ml ) for the indicated times. The lysates were analysed as in Figure 1. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands. ( B ) The viability of keratinocytes of the indicated genotype was measured at indicated time points using an MTS assay

. Constitutive activation of non-canonical NF-κB in Traf2EKOTnf-/- mice might, however, be responsible for the later onset skin disease that developed in these Tnf-deficient mice ( Figure 11 ). To test this, we deleted both Tnf and Nfkb2, which completely rescued the skin inflammation in Traf2EKO mice. These data provide insights into the mechanism of initiation and development of inflammatory skin disease that may be important to further understanding of diseases such as psoriasis

., 2011 ). Based on the presence of apoptotic cells in the epidermal layer of Traf2EKO mice ( Figure 4B ), spontaneous secretion of TNF by Traf2-/- keratinocytes in culture ( Figure 4C ) and the disrupted TNF signalling in Traf2-/- keratinocytes ( Figure 2D ), we hypothesised that depletion of TNF would also prevent the inflammation in the skin of Traf2EKO mice. Therefore, Traf2EKO mice were crossed to Tnf-/- mice

. The signature of inflammatory genes expression was changed in Traf2-/-Tnf-/- compared to Traf2+/-Tnf-/- keratinocytes ( Figure 5 ) and the inflammatory response was reduced in Traf-/-T-nf- keratin compared to T2/-nf- keratin ( Figure 6 ).

    Title: A dynamin 1-, dynamin 3- and clathrin-independent pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling mediated by bulk endocytosis
    Abstract: The exocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) elicited by potent stimulation is rapidly compensated by bulk endocytosis of SV membranes leading to large endocytic vacuoles ( ‘bulk’ endosomes ). Subsequently, these vacuoles disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underlying this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and that operates during intense synaptic activity.

    Supporting Text:
    Synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) are the specialized organelles that store and secrete non-peptide neurotransmitters at synapses. Following exocytosis, their membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for the generation of new fusion-competent SVs ( Ceccarelli et al., 1973; Heuser and Reese, 1973; Betz and Bewick, 1992 ). Strong evidence indicates that clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) plays a key role in this endocytic traffic ( Heuser and Reese, 1973; Maycox et al

While the revision of this manuscript was being finalized, a paper by Kononenko et al. ( 2014 ) reported that bulk endocytosis in response to a strong stimulus is dynamin 1/3 dependent ( based on RNA interference ) and proposed an important role for clathrin in SV budding from endosomes

. Given evidence for a robust contribution of bulk endosomes to the reformation of SVs, the potential role of clathrin to the budding of new SVs from such organelles during recovery from an acute stimulation was explored. CCPs were nearly absent before stimulation in synapses of all genotypes, including Dyn1 KO and Dyn1/3 DKO synapses ( Figure 7A–D ), as spontaneous network activity prior to the stimulation had been silenced by an overnight treatment with TTX. 10. 7554/eLife. 01621

. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that neither Dyn1 nor Dyn3 is required for bulk endocytosis and that their absence delays, but does not abolish, SV reformation from internal membranes. 10. 7554/eLife. 01621. 005Figure 3. Bulk endocytosis and conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs analyzed with soluble HRP labeling after high K+ stimulation in WT and dynamin mutant synapses

. Our results, which are based on studies of dynamin 1/3 double KO synapses and on the ultrastructrual analysis of the time course of SV recovery from bulk endosomes in the presence or near depletion of clathrin lead to different conclusions.

., 2011; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 ). Conversion of bulk endosomes into new SVs does occur in these synapses, although less efficiently than in wild-type ( WT ) synapses. The partial impairment of this conversion is not further aggravated by the additional knock-down ( KD ) of clathrin, indicating the clathrin-independence of this process

. Like any other form of endocytosis, bulk endocytosis involves membrane remodeling and membrane fission. Thus, several studies of bulk endocytosis have addressed the potential involvement of dynamin, a GTPase known to mediate endocytic membrane fission in multiple contexts including, most prominently, endocytic fission at neuronal synapses ( Koenig and Ikeda, 1989; Ramaswami et al., 1994; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 ). However, conflicting results have been reported

. This mechanism predominates under intense neuronal activity ( Miller and Heuser, 1984; Holt et al., 2003; Wu and Wu, 2007; Hayashi et al., 2008; Cousin, 2009; Wenzel et al., 2012; Kittelmann et al., 2013 ). Endocytic intermediates generated by bulk endocytosis, henceforth defined as ‘bulk’ endosomes, eventually disappear as new SVs appear, suggesting a precursor-product relationship and possibly a direct formation of SVs from bulk endosomes ( Heuser and Reese, 1973 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01621. 013 To directly address a potential clathrin independence of SV reformation form bulk endosomes, we performed clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) KD experiments using a lentivirus based strategy ( Thomas et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2013 ). CHC was knocked down in Dyn1/3 DKO neurons by transducing them with lentivirus encoding CHC shRNAmiR or control shRNAmiR

. We demonstrate that the rapid, bulk endocytic recapture of SV membranes induced by a strong stimulus, either KCl or high frequency stimulation, is not impaired at synapses lacking both of the two predominant neuronal dynamins, dynamin 1 and dynamin 3, that is synapses where CME is severely perturbed ( Ferguson et al., 2007; Raimondi et al., 2011; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 )

The entire pie represents the SV pool before stimulation

. Note that the number of CTX-HRP positive SVs, that is SVs generated during post-stimulus endocytosis, was only modestly decreased in Dyn1 KO and Dyn1/3 DKO synapses relative to their controls ( Figure 2E, F ), suggesting that either clathrin/dynamin-dependent SV endocytosis is not involved in their formation or that dynamin/clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurring during the recovery can be sustained by dynamin 2 even though the levels of this dynamin isoform in neurons are very low

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01621. 014 To test the contribution of clathrin to the recovery of SVs from bulk endosomes, CHC depleted Dyn1/3 DKO neurons ( and Dyn1/3 DKO neurons as controls ) were exposed to the same protocol used for Figures 3 and 4 ( overnight silencing with TTX, 90 s stimulation in HRP containing high K+ buffer and finally recovery in HRP-free resting medium ) with analysis by EM

. Based on a study of ‘broken’ synaptosomes it was proposed that such a conversion occurs via the same clathrin-mediated budding reaction that drives clathrin-mediated budding from the plasma membrane ( Takei et al., 1996 ). However, in that study bulk endosomes were exposed to conditions that can induce ectopic production of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( incubation with ATP and GTP or GTPγS ) ( Seaman et al., 1993; Takei et al., 1996; Krauss et al., 2003 )

.

Loss of HRP-labeled SVs during the second stimulus, and the subsequent recovery of unlabeled SVs, demonstrates that vesicles generated from bulk endosomes are functional SVs. ( B ) Quantification of the results shown in A

. In summary, KD of CHC in Dyn1/3 DKO neurons does not enhance the inhibitory effect on SV formation from bulk endosomes observed in Dyn1/3 DKO synapses, indicating that clrin is not required for the conversion of bulkosomes to SVs.

    Title: Identification of human glucocorticoid response markers using integrated multi-omic analysis from a randomized crossover trial
    Abstract: Glucocorticoids are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, but there is no biomarker that can quantify their action. The aim of the study was to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action. In a randomized, crossover, single-blind, discovery study, 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency ( and no other endocrinopathies ) were admitted at the in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. A randomization plan before the first intervention was used. Besides mild physical and/or mental fatigue and salt craving, no serious adverse events were observed. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster, both predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. A microRNA ( miR-122-5p ) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure was identified ( p=0. 009 ) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure ( 0. 01 ≤ p≤0. 05 ). We have generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarker ( s ) to measure effects of glucocorticoids, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.

   . In this clinical biomarker discovery study, we identified genes, miRNA, and metabolites that are differently expressed during GC exposure and GC withdrawal in subjects with Addison’s disease. The multi-omic data showed a high degree of coherence, and network analysis identified transcriptomics and metabolites that were closely correlated

. Moreover, the association between the expression of miR-122-5p and GC exposure was replicated in three independent study groups. In order to identify putative biomarkers of GC action in humans, a clinical study was considered to be the most appropriate experimental setting. Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, but a unique clinical model for GC biomarker discovery due to absent or very low endogenous GC production ( Gan et al., 2014; Sævik et al

. A multi-omic analysis strategy combining data from gene expression in circulation ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] ) and an important metabolic tissue, adipose tissue, integrated with circulating microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and metabolites was used to identify putative biomarkers. The strongest putative biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure.

. We identified a transcriptomic profile that was under similar GC regulation in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes, which was then validated by comparison to a range of previously published data by other research groups from cellular assays. We also identified a circulating miRNA, miR-122-5p, which was correlated with the circulating transcriptome and metabolome findings, suggesting for the first time a functional role in GC action

. 009 ) ( Figure 6 ). Two subjects did not show this miR-122-5p response, one man ( disease duration 2 years, body mass index [BMI] 23. 8 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 20 mg daily, fludrocortisone 0. 1 mg daily ) and one woman ( disease duration 23 years; BMI 28. 1 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 30 mg daily, fludrocortisone 0. 2 mg daily ) who both experienced mild mental fatigue during GC withdrawal

In a clinical experimental study designed to identify biomarkers of GC action, we succeeded in generating two profoundly different states of GC exposure within the physiological range in the same individual. The novelty of this study is the identification of pathways related to GC response and putative biomarkers of GC action in gene expression, metabolome, and miRNAs derived from integrated multi-omic analysis in two independent tissues

. miR-122-5p was correlated with cortisol exposure and the expression of FKBP5, a regulator of GC sensitivity ( cluster 11 in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1f ). Targeted replication of the plasma miR-122-5p fold change from the experimental study in subjects with Addison’s disease using an independent RNA separation procedure showed a marked down-regulation of miR-122-5p by increased GC exposure ( p=0. 009 ) ( Figure 6 )

. The measurable but very low concentrations of serum cortisol and cortisone throughout the GC withdrawal may be explained by a residual adrenal steroid secretion in some subjects ( Gan et al., 2014; Sævik et al., 2020 ) and/or due to conversion of cortisone to cortisol in the liver and adipose tissue ( Stimson et al., 2014 ). Network models of ‘omic data can be used as a framework to assess the potential utility of biomarkers ( Stevens et al., 2014 )

. The 14 miRNAs included in the analysis based on the findings from the untargeted analysis were miR-425-3p, miR-186-5p, miR-15b-5p, miR-95-3p, miR-16-1-3p, miR-576-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-200a-3p, miR-193b-3p, miR-424-5p, miR-574-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-18a-5p, and let-7g-5p. Metabolic profiling of serum by GC-MS and LC-MS was performed at the Swedish Metabolomics Center in Umeå, Sweden. Preprocessing of ‘omics data sets was carried out in the following ways

., 2007; Jewell et al., 2012 ) ]. The set of nine genes co-regulated in relation to GC exposure and GC withdrawal in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes can therefore be considered as putative markers of GC response. These could be used as a gene set to interrogate GC action in other experimental settings. All the miRNA findings in this study are novel. While emerging experimental evidence indicates impact on regulation of GC action at several points by miRNAs ( Clayton et al

. There is no clear explanation for this, except the possibility that high non-physiological GC exposure has other secondary effects that may affect the levels of miR-122-5p. The network analysis also identified putative metabolomic markers of GC action. GCs have a key role in metabolic regulation of stress by mobilizing energy through glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism

. physiological GC exposure, respectively ) ( Bergthorsdottir et al., 2017 ) ; and ( iii ) acute low, medium, and excessive GC exposure in 20 healthy subjects ( Stimson et al., 2017 ). From this analysis, miR-122-5p was significantly associated with different GC exposure in all studies ( Figure 7A– D )

. Some of the other metabolomic data from our study was also in line with previous metabolomic studies in patients with adrenal insufficiency ( Alwashih et al., 2017b; Sorgdrager et al., 2018 )

Glucocorticoids ( GCs ) have a key role in the metabolic, vascular, and immunological response to stress ( Cain and Cidlowski, 2017; Oster et al., 2017 ). GC secretion from the adrenal gland is under tight dynamic control by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and is regulated in a classic circadian pattern ( Cain and Cidlowski, 2017; Oster et al., 2017 ). Most actions of GCs are mediated by the ubiquitously expressed GC receptor ( Cain and Cidlowski, 2017; Oster et al., 2017 )

. The final outcome of the study is identification of a miRNA that is regulated by GC exposure and correlated with genes and metabolites that are also regulated by GCs in this study, indicating its functional relevance. The replication of this miRNA in three independent study groups increases the likelihood that the discovered miRNA, miR-122-5p, could become a biomarker of GC action to be used in clinical settings.

. The rationale for selecting these groups was that their GC exposure mostly remained within the normal physiological range. Despite the experimental differences between these studies, and the fact that these studies were not designed to study miRNA biomarkers of GC action, miR-122-5p was down-regulated by GC exposure in all three studies ( Figure 7A–D ). The miR-122p-5 was also correlated with the expression of FKBP5, a regulator of GC sensitivity ( Figure 5— supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1 ). This suggests that mi-122p may play a role in GC regulation of GC sensitivity. The miR-122p was also correlated with metabolites regulated by GC ( Figure 7A–D ) indicating that mi-122p may be involved in metabolic regulation by GC. The miR-122p was also correlated with expression of genes regulated by GC ( Figure 7–D ) indicating that mi-122 may be involved in regulation of GC action. The mi-122p was also correlated with metabolites regulated by GC ( Figure 7–D ) indicating that mi-122 may be involved in metabolic regulation by GC. The mi-122 was also correlated with expression regulated by GC ( Figure 7– ) indicating that-122 may be involved in regulation of GC. The mi-122 was correlated with regulated by GC ( Figure 7 ) indicating that- may be involved in regulation GC.

    Title: Dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids
    Abstract: Amino acids are essential activators of mTORC1 via a complex containing RAG GTPases, RAGULATOR and the vacuolar ATPase. Sensing of amino acids causes translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, an obligate step for activation. To examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of this translocation, we used live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester. Translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 min of aa addition and peaking within 5 min. It is temporally coupled with fluorescent leucine appearance in lysosomes and is sustained in comparison to aa stimulation. Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity in our experimental system. Of note, phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targetting its substrates elsewhere.

    Supporting Text:
   . We describe here the dynamics of activation of the mTORC1 complex in these cells, with special emphasis in the HAP-1 cells. To examine whether mTORC1 responds directly to lysosomal amino acids, we have also generated a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of leucine in order to image RAPTOR translocation in response to this compound.

. Among amino acids, leucine has a prominent role in mTORC1 activation, and it has also been reported that a leucine methyl ester that enters cells and accumulates in lysosomes can activate mTORC1 on its own ( Zoncu et al., 2011 ). Prompted by this, we tested a series of leucine analogues for mTORC1 activation ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B )

. These results suggested that the lysosome is a crucial locus for mTOR activation but the dynamics of this process and how mTORC1 activity is connected to lysosomal residence may be more complicated than current models. To examine the dynamics of mTOR in response to amino acids we tried to express subunits of mTORC1 tagged with GFP in order to follow localization in live cells

. This analogue, a methyl ester of di-leucine with a fluorescent moiety attached, produces a sustained translocation of the complex presumably owing to its property to continuously accumulate within the lysosomal lumen. All of these data provide for the first time a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids

., 2011 ). All of these data support the idea that amino acids ultimately activate mTORC1 in the cell interior, and probably more than one type of sensing ( and amino acid ) is involved. For example, although leucine is sensed by the Sestrin1/2 proteins ( Wolfson et al., 2016 ), recent work demonstrates that levels of arginine entering the lysosomes via transporter SLC38A9 are also important for mTORC1 activation ( Rebsamen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015 )

., 2009 ). Other recent work suggests that cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase is a leucine sensor and activates mTORC1 ( Han et al., 2012; Bonfils et al., 2012 ), consistent with the known primacy of leucine among amino acids in activation of mTORC1. An “inside-out” sensing mechanism has also been proposed whereby amino acids in the lysosomal lumen are sensed by the vacuolar ATPase, and this signal is transmitted to the lysosomal exterior for activation of the RAGULATOR ( Zoncu et al

. It is possible that mTOR requires translocation to the lysosomal surface as part of the amino acid sensing function, but, subsequent to that, the complex comes off the membrane rapidly in order to phosphorylate its substrates. According to this model, the lysosomal surface may not be a terminal destination where activated mTOR resides but rather a platform that casts activated mTORC1 into the cytosol ( Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 1C )

We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of mTOR activation and its kinetic dependence on amino acid presence. Pioneering work from several laboratories had already provided strong evidence that mTOR itself translocates to lysosomes during amino acid re-stimulation ( Sancak et al., 2008, 2010; Zoncu et al., 2011 ), but this work had relied exclusively on a single antibody that can stain the endogenous protein and it did not provide any information on the dynamics of the process

. ( C ) A model for mTORC1 transiently translocating to the lysosomal surface and then phosphorylating some of its substrates in the cytosol. Our data are consistent with the idea that soon after amino acid replenishment the mTORC1 complex translocates to the lysosome but it then comes off the lysosomes at later time points while still active towards its substrates. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 19960

., 2009; Wang and Proud, 2009 ). The mechanism by which amino acids are sensed by mTORC1 is beginning to be elucidated ( reviewed in Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Jewell and Guan, 2013; Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014 ). It appears that the active form of mTORC1 that responds positively to amino acid availability resides on late endosomal/lysosomal membranes, whereas absence of amino acids causes the translocation of mTORC1 from this compartment into the cytosol

. The RAPTOR-GFP edited cells that we used here provide a unique tool to address this question in a near-physiological setting. Although they are slightly less responsive to stimuli than the parental cells and require a more carefully assembled mixture of activators, they nevertheless show absolute reliance on amino acids for mTORC1 activation and RAPTOR translocation to lysosomes

. Our work also revealed an apparent uncoupling between the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and the kinetics of mTORC1 target phosphorylation. In both HAP-1 cells edited to express endogenous RAPTOR-GFP and in HEK-293 cells stained for endogenous mTOR, phosphorylation of S6K and ULK1, major and direct mTORC1 targets, persisted long after translocation to the lysosomes had peaked and had returned to levels approaching the base line

. These data suggest that the fluorescent analogue requires intact and functional lysosomes to signal to mTORC1 and that its mechanism of being sensed depends on Sestrin2 although it does not require delivery via macropinocytosis.

. This result implies that activated mTORC1 may exist in the cytosol, and not exclusively on the lysosomal surface. In line with this, a direct target of mTORC1 in this pathway, the protein 4EBP-1, was never detected to accumulate on lysosomes ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

. Of note, when - based on live imaging - the RAPTOR-GFP translocation to the lysosomes was back to low levels during amino acid recovery, the protein was still bound to RAGA based on the immunoprecipitation experiments. This would suggest the possibility that translocation to the lysosomal surface may allow mTORC1 to acquire activated RAG proteins before returning to the cytosol

. Interestingly, whereas lysotracker staining of lysosomes was completely eliminated by GPN in both cell types ( Figure 7D and F, top panels ) the fluorescent analogue still accumulated ( Figure 7D and F, bottom panels ). Of note, activation of mTORC1 in response to the fluorescent analogue was also sensitive to vacuolar ATPase inhibitors for HEK-293 cells ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) and for HAP-1 RAPTOR-GFP cells ( not shown ). 10. 7554/eLife. 19960. 020Figure 7

. HEK-293 cells were starved of amino acids and growth factors, and re-stimulated for the indicated times with MEM amino acids. ( A ) The phosphorylation of S6K at T389 was established as a surrogate for mTORC1 activity. Band marked with an asterisk serves as loading control. ( B ) Under the same conditions the localization of mTOR and the LAMP-1 lysosomal protein were examined by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies that recognise the endogenous protein

. Despite tremendous progress, the exact mechanism by which mTORC1 senses amino acids appears very complex and incomplete at present ( reviewed and commented on in: Goberdham et al, 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Shimobayashi and Hall, 2016 ). Clearly, several different sensors are involved ( sometimes for the same amino acid, e. g. for arginine ), and the topology of the phenomenon involves the cytosol as well as the lysosomal membrane and the lysosomal lumen.

    Title: Glycan modification of antigen alters its intracellular routing in dendritic cells, promoting priming of T cells
    Abstract: Antigen uptake by dendritic cells and intracellular routing of antigens to specific compartments is regulated by C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. We show that the modification of Ovalbumin ( OVA ) with the glycan-structure LewisX ( LeX ) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. LeX-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, LeX modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-LeX-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8+ effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-LeX neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.

    We here demonstrate that the glycosylation-profile of antigens has a major influence on antigen uptake and intracellular compartmentalization, thereby affecting both antigen presentation and the type and strength of the induced immune response. Modification of the model-antigen OVA with LeX glycans directs OVA towards MGL1, skewing naive CD4+ T cell differentiation towards IFNγ-producing Th1 cells

. In fact, the OVA-LeX immunized MGL1 KO mice displayed comparable numbers of effector T cells as WT mice immunized with native OVA. Together, these data show that the conjugation of two LeX glycans on OVA re-directs OVA to the CLR MGL1 and thereby enhances CD8+ T cell priming in vivo. 10. 7554/eLife. 11765. 005Figure 2. Immunization with OVA-LeX induces increased CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. ( A ) Expression of murine MGL on BM-DCs and CD11c+ spDCs was analyzed by flow cytometry

., 2014 ). Here, we demonstrate that conjugation of the LeX carbohydrate to the model antigen OVA alters its routing from a MR- and TAP1-dependent cross-presentation pathway into a TAP1- and Cathepsin-S-independent pathway, devoid of any TLR-signaling dependence, which simultaneously enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells. Cross-presentation was associated with prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ vesicles

. Moreover, targeting OVA to MGL1 through the conjugation of LeX, substantially enhanced cross-presentation as revealed by the increased frequency of OVA-specific CD8+ effector T cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, MGL1-dependent cross-presentation occurred at low antigen dose and independently of TLR-signaling. Moreover, this cross-presentation pathway did not involve TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S

. Using MGL1KO mice, that lack MGL1 expression on DC ( Figure 2B ), we ascertained that MGL1 is the prime lectin involved in boosting the generation of antigen-specific effector T cells as upon immunization of these mice with LeX-conjugated OVA no enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNFα-double-producing T cells were detected ( Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

. At this stage, we do not know whether high glycan valency further enhances or inhibits the MGL1-mediated ( cross- ) priming. The fact that pulsing of DCs with OVA-LeX resulted in improved cross-priming and Th1-skewing indicates that conjugation of these carbohydrates to tumor-antigens could be beneficial for the induction of potent anti-tumor responses. Therefore, the use of glycans for targeting CLR for anti-cancer immunotherapy could have several advantages

., 2007 ). In the current study, we investigated the effect of modifying the glycan composition of OVA on the efficacy of cross-presentation, priming and differentiation of T cells. We hypothesized that modification of the antigen with specific glycans would re-direct antigens to other CLRs resulting in altered intracellular routing and presentation of antigen and Th differentiation

., 2003; Ohana-Malka et al., 2003 ). Although in our studies only two LeX glycans were conjugated to each OVA molecule, it cannot be ruled out that multivalent presentation of LeX, such as often observed on tumors or pathogens ( Bergman et al., 2004; Saeland and van, 2011 ), may alter avidity-induced MGL-1 signaling and antigen presentation, and induce an anti-inflammatory immune repertoire

. In the current study, we show that already at very low concentrations, soluble protein antigens are efficiently cross-presented upon uptake by MGL1. DCs pulsed with a low dose of OVA-LeX ( 7. 5 μg/ml ) induced significant CD8+ T cell proliferation, whereas the same concentration of native OVA was hardly cross-presented ( Figure 4 ). Others have demonstrated that native OVA can only be cross-presented when a high dose was used ( 0. 5–1

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11765. 010 Since we observed a great enhancement of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming in vivo when immunizing with OVA-LeX to target MGL1, we wanted to reveal the mechanism that regulates this augmented cross-priming

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11765. 007 Since we observed that LeX-modified OVA increased priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells we examined whether this also enhanced antigen-presentation to CD4+ T cells. Both OVA-LeX-loaded and native OVA-loaded spDCs induced CD4+ OT-II T cell proliferation to a similar extent ( Figure 3A ), illustrating that the altered antigen uptake mediated by LeX did not affect loading on MHC class II molecules

., 2015; Adiko et al., 2015] ). Although we observed localization of OVA-LeX in early endosomes, absence of either TAP molecules or Cathepsin-S did not influence the enhanced cross-presentation of OVA-LeX. Our data indicate that the MGL1 cross-presentation pathway is different than that of the MR and may occur via antigen storage compartments similar to those described for FcγR-targeted antigens ( van Montfoort et al., 2009 )

. The fact that the addition of LeX glycans to OVA obviates the need for TLR signals for the induction of cross-presentation and Th1 priming in vitro, may indicate that MGL1 signaling is involved in these processes. Some CLR, like DC-SIGN, Clec9A and Dectin-1 are known to induce signaling after triggering by their natural ligands ( Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009; Sancho et al., 2009 ). Till now, no signaling pathway has been described for MGL1

. We have chosen to conjugate the carbohydrate structure LewisX ( LeX ) to 2 free cysteine residues within the native OVA glycoprotein. LeX is a ligand of the murine C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type lectin ( MGL ) -1 ( Singh et al

. Similar binding with an anti-OVA antibody was determined, which indicates that similar protein concentrations in the preparations of OVA and OVA-LeX used in our study are present ( Figure 1B, right panel ). In conclusion, through glycan profiling we identified 23% mannose-rich glycans on native OVA that may facilitate MR binding. Addition of the glycan LeX, next to these mannose glycans, on cysteine residues ( two LeX moieties per molecule ), conveyed MGL1 specificity to OVA

    Title: Quorum sensing control of Type VI secretion factors restricts the proliferation of quorum-sensing mutants
    Abstract: Burkholderia thailandensis uses acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing systems to regulate hundreds of genes. Here we show that cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion ( T6S ) toxin-immunity systems are among those activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis. We also demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth coculture, presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. Thus, quorum sensing activates B. thailandensis T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control.

    Supporting Text:
    We present evidence that QS control of T6SS-1-mediated toxicity and immunity genes allows QS competent members of B. thailandensis colonies to police against BtaR1- QS mutants. During planktonic growth in broth where T6SS-1 does not function due to limited cell contact, BtaR1- mutants have a substantial fitness advantage over wild-type cells, presumably because of the cost associated with BtaR1-dependent activities

. We describe a mechanism by which wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing; QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system

. Policing of social deviants in Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported previously ( Manhes and Velicer, 2011; Sandoz et al., 2007 ). Here we describe a novel mechanism, for limiting quorum sensing mutant growth in bacterial groups. Several functions have been ascribed to T6S. B. thailandensis T6S-mediated killing is active against Proteobacteria species other than B. thailandensis and is thought to be important for interspecies competition ( Schwarz et al

. This served as a control to demonstrate T6SS-1-mediated killing does not occur in liquid broth cocultures. Results are the mean of at least three biological replicates. Ranges were within the size of the symbols. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 14712. 007 We reason that the parent, with an intact QS system, would express quorum-activated T6SS-1 toxin and immunity proteins, whereas the BtaR1- mutant should not fully induce its T6SS-1 effectors and immunity factors

Bacterial quorum sensing ( QS ) often controls factors that benefit cells in groups; it controls cooperative activities. A well-studied type of QS common to a number of Proteobacteria species is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) signals. AHLs are made by members of the LuxI family of signal synthases. The AHLs can diffuse in and out of cells

. Furthermore, we note that other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have been reported to be under control of other non-AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems, for example the E. coli mazEF encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are controlled by a linear pentapeptide quorum sensing signal ( Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007 )

. Expression of a toxin and its antitoxin results in a toxin-resistant producer cell, which can deliver toxins via the secretion apparatus via cell-cell contact to a sensitive cell thereby inhibiting growth of the sensitive cell ( Russell et al., 2014 ). We show that T6S provides wild-type B. thailandensis with an ability to constrain BtaR1 mutants in a contact-dependent manner

. We propose that the T6SS-1-mediated killing defect in the BtaR1- mutant results from its inability to fully activate expression of one or more T6S toxin genes. We hypothesized that the QS-activated T6SS-1 effector and immunity proteins in wild-type bacteria restrict the proliferation of BtaR1- mutants upon cell contact in cocultures. This hypothesis was tested in LB agar competition experiments with a △clpV T6SS-1 secretion apparatus mutant ( T6SS-1- ) and a BtaR1-T6SS-1- mutant

., 2014 ). However, CDI does not limit the outgrowth of the BtaR1- mutant during agar-grown cocultures. We next asked whether QS regulates other contact-dependent growth inhibitory factors. B. thailandensis contains five different T6SSs, at least one of which is used for interspecies competition ( T6SS-1 ) ( Schwarz et al., 2010 ). The T6SS-1 comprises a pathway that delivers effector proteins to neighboring cells upon direct cell contact

., 2013; Dandekar et al., 2012 ) ; Quorum sensing activates genes coding for public goods ( such as extracellular proteases ), as well as a limited set of privately utilized goods ( such as a hydrolase that allows producing cells to utilize adenosine ). When cells are supplied with both casein and adenosine, QS signal receptor ( LasR ) mutant cheats are penalized and constrained ( Dandekar et al., 2012 ). A second mechanism has been called metabolic prudence ( Xavier et al

To assess the fitness of the B. thailandensis QS mutants in competition with their parent, we cocultured the wild type with signal blind QS mutants. We used signal-blind mutants BtaR1-, BtaR2- or BtaR3- ( which each have mutations in the LuxR homolog genes btaR1, btaR2, or btaR3 ) because they cannot respond to signals made by QS-proficient bacteria in coculture. The starting inoculum was 99% wild type and 1% signal-blind mutant

. thailandensis mutant lacking tle1, tli1, and adjacent immunity paralogs ( △tle1BTH_I2699-2703 ). Consistent with a previous publication ( Russell et al., 2013 ), the wild type outcompeted the T6SS-1 effector and immunity mutant ( Figure 2B ). We also found that the BtaR1- mutant was impaired in inhibition of the effector and immunity mutant ( Figure 2B ). The BtaR2- and BtaR3- mutants each showed wild-type levels of inhibition ( Figure 2B )

., 2013 ). When a B. thailandensis recipient cell does not produce the Tli1 immunity protein, Tle1 acts as a T6SS-1-delivered antibacterial factor ( Russell et al., 2013 ). In addition to tle1 and tli1, QS activates neighboring tle1 and tli1 paralogs ( BTH_I2701 and BTH_I2702 ) ( Figure 2A ). To test the hypothesis that QS activates T6SS-1-mediated killing in B. thailandensis, we competed the wild type or the signal blind QS mutants against a B

., 2015 ). The P. aeruginosa policing is a rare example of this sort of activity in bacteria, and because cyanide production and resistance has some semblance to a toxin-immunity-like mechanism we hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems might have some generality as a policing mechanism where QS bacteria can control QS mutants. We recently used RNAseq to identify genes in the Burkholderia thailandensis QS regulon ( Majerczyk et al., 2014 ). B

. Among the many growth conditions that vary between liquid- and agar-grown cocultures is a difference in cell-to-cell contact. Cell contact is minimal during growth in broth but does occur when cells are grown on a solid agar surface. This led us to ask if QS controls contact-dependent growth inhibition systems. We previously reported that QS-1 activated the contact-dependent inhibition ( CDI ) system encoded by the cdiAIB genes ( Majerczyk et al., 2014 )

. It is interesting that BtaR1 also promotes aggregation of cells under some conditions ( Chandler et al., 2009 ). One can imagine that this system brings cells into close proximity where they can resist infiltration by other strains and species while at the same time protect themselves against social deviant BtaR1 mutant bacteria ( Figure 4 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 14712. 008Figure 4

. In this experiment, the BtaR1-T6SS-1- mutant rose in frequency from about 1% to nearly 25% of the population ( Figure 3A ). When the T6SS-1- apparatus was intact, the frequency of Bta1-TSS-1 rose from 1% to 5% ( Figure 3A ). The Bta2-TSS- and B3-TSS- mutants did not differ from the wild type ( Figure 3 ). We also found that Bta1-TSS-1 was outcompeted by the wild type in agar-grown cocultures ( Figure 3 ) but not in liquid-grown cocultures ( Figure 3 ). The Bta1-TSS- was not outcompeted by the wild in agar-grown cocultures ( Figure 3 ) but in liquid-grown cocultures ( Figure 3 ). The B2-TSS and B3-TSS did not differ from the wild in agar-grown cocult ( Figure 3 ) or liquid-grown ( Figure 3 )

    Title: Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse
    Abstract: The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life. The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain.

   ., 2011; Hartung et al., 2016 ). Moreover, the temporal delay of 10–20 ms between prefrontal and hippocampal spike trains as well as the estimated directionality of information flow between the two areas suggested that hippocampal theta drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC. The present data directly prove this hypothesis, taking advantage of the recently developed protocol for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal networks at neonatal age ( Bitzenhofer et al

. We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral ( i/vHP ), but not of dorsal HP ( dHP ) elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections.

. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to PL via direct axonal projections suggest that the HP acts already at neonatal age as a drive for prelimbic activation. Moreover, the differences identified between the dHP – PL and i/vHP – PL communication argue for prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis

. The present data and optogenetic protocol represent the pre-requisite of this investigation, opening new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain. One question that remains to be addressed is how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Following the general rules of activity-dependent plasticity ( Hubel et al., 1977; Huberman et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2011; Yasuda et al

. These data reveal that SPWs-ripples from intermediate/ventral but less from the dorsal part of hippocampal CA1 correlate with pronounced neuronal firing and local entrainment in the PL of neonatal mice. To identify the anatomical substrate of different coupling strength between i/vHP - PL and dHP - PL, we monitored the projections that originate from the CA1 area in both hippocampal subdivisions and target the PFC

. We previously proposed that the hippocampal CA1 area drives the oscillatory entrainment of PFC at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Here, we developed a methodological approach to optically manipulate the neonatal HP along its septo-temporal axis

., 2005; Hallock et al., 2016; Place et al., 2016 ). Both theta and gamma network oscillations contribute to the functional long-range coupling. The model of prefrontal-hippocampal communication has been initially built based on experimental evidence correlating the temporal organization of neuronal and network activity in the two brain areas

. While abundant literature documented the contribution of SPWs-spindles complex to memory-relevant processing in downstream targets, such as PFC ( Colgin, 2011; Buzsáki, 2015; Colgin, 2016 ), it is unknown how these complexes affect the development of cortical activation. Simultaneous recordings from neonatal CA1 area either in dHP or i/vHP and PL showed that already at neonatal age, prefrontal oscillations are generated shortly ( ~100 ms ) after hippocampal SPWs-ripples

., 2012 ). Temporal associations between the firing and synaptic discharges of individual neurons and network oscillations in different frequency bands gave first insights into the cellular substrate of coordinated activity in neonates. Whereas in sensory systems, endogenous activation of sensory periphery drives entrainment of local circuitry through gap junction coupling as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission ( Dupont et al., 2006; Hanganu et al., 2006; Minlebaev et al

. In a seminal study, Spellman and colleagues used light-driven inhibition of axonal terminals for dissecting the directionality of interactions between PFC and HP during different phases of memory retrieval ( Spellman et al., 2015 ). We previously showed that at neonatal age, long before full maturation of memory and attentional abilities, discontinuous theta bursts in i/vHP are temporally correlated to the network oscillations in the PFC and time the prefrontal firing ( Brockmann et al

. Abundant literature links theta frequency coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks to cognitive performance and emotional states of adults ( Adhikari et al., 2010; Xu and Südhof, 2013; Spellman et al., 2015; Hallock et al., 2016; Place et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2017 ). The early emergence of directed communication between PFC and i/vHP raises the question of functional relevance of this early coupling during development and at adulthood

. Anterograde and retrograde tracing demonstrated the density increase along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampal axons targeting the PL. Light activation/inhibition of these axonal terminals paired with monitoring of network oscillations in the PFC might offer valuable insights into the patterns of coupling sufficient for activation

. i/vHP led us to question their outcome for the long-range coupling in the developing brain. Past studies identified tight interactions between HP and PFC, which emerge already at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al., 2011; Hartung et al., 2016 ) and are in support of memory at adulthood ( Krüger et al., 2012; Spellman et al., 2015; Place et al., 2016 ). The discontinuous theta oscillations in HP have been proposed to drive the activation of local circuits in the PFC

. 001, gamma: p<0. 001 ) ( Figure 6A, C ). Taken together, these data reveal the critical role of hippocampal activity for the oscillatory entrainment of PL and identify pyramidal neurons in CA1 area of of i/vHP but not dHP as drivers for the broad activation of local prelimbic circuits.

., 2002; Stark et al., 2013 ). It has been previously proposed that oscillatory activity in cortical regions may be entrained due to the rhythmic theta-band output from the hippocampus ( Stark et al., 2013; Colgin, 2016 ). Several considerations regarding the technical challenges of optogenetic manipulation of HP along the septo-temporal axis need to be made

In the adult rodent brain, coordinated patterns of oscillatory activity code in a frequency-specific manner for sensory and cognitive performance. For example, learning and memory critically depend on oscillations within theta frequency band ( 4–12 Hz ) that functionally couple the medial prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) and hippocampus ( HP ) ( Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Benchenane et al., 2010; Brincat and Miller, 2015; Backus et al., 2016; Eichenbaum, 2017; Wirt and Hyman, 2017 )

., 2013 ). It is still an issue of debate when exactly ripples emerge in the developing hippocampus, although it is obvious that they appear later than theta bursts and SPWs, most likely towards the end of the first and during second postnatal week ( Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005; Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Their underlying mechanisms at neonatal age remain also largely unknown and need to be related to age-dependent changes in gap junctional coupling and GABA switch ( Ben-Ari et al

. Only recently the methodological difficulties related to area-, layer- and cell type-specific manipulations at neonatal age have been overcome ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a; Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b ). By these means, the local neuronal interplay generating beta-gamma oscillations in the PFC has been elucidated. However, the long-range coupling causing the activation of local prefrontal circuits is still unresolved

. The direct unilateral optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons in CA1 area of iHP but not dHP elicits broad oscillations in the P of neon mice via dense axonal projections ( Figure 7A, B ), C. The coupling and information flow from hippocamp CA1 to PL via direct axonal suggest that HP already at neon age acts as a drive for prefront activation Moreover, the differences between dHP – PL and iHP argue for augmentation of driving along the sept-temporal hippocal axis. The data and optogenetic protocol represent the prerequisite for this investigation, opening perspectives for assessing adult readout of long communication in the developing brain. question that remains to be addressed is how hippocal drive the maturation of prefront-hipocamp networks following the rules of activity-dependent plasticity ( Hubel et al,1977; Hub et al,2006; Xu et,201; Yasuda et al. 201

    Title: Methylation of RNA polymerase II non-consensus Lysine residues marks early transcription in mammalian cells
    Abstract: Dynamic post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) coordinates the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain ( CTD ), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated ( K7ac ). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues ( K7me1 and K7me2 ). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.

    Supporting Text:
   . RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 ( S5p ) and Serine-7 ( S7p ), marking the earliest stages of transcription ( Akhtar et al., 2009; Chapman et al., 2007; Tietjen et al., 2010 ). Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Serine-2 ( S2p ) throughout gene bodies, with the highest levels found around transcription end sites ( TES )

. We produce new antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 and show that these novel modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7, upstream of S2 phosphorylation. Using biochemical and genome-wide approaches, we show that CTD-K7 methylation is present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA, but defines the earliest stages of the transcription cycle

. These observations show that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and suggest that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues. Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues was recently identified and found associated with inducible gene expression ( Schroeder et al., 2013 )

This conclusion is also supported by the increased detection of K7me1 and K7me2 with increased number of K7 residues in the mammalian CTD ( cell lines 1K, 3K and 8K; Figure 3e ), each flanked by slightly different amino acids ( Figure 1a ). The observation that mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues is detected primarily in the hypophosphorylated ( faster-migrating ) forms of RPB1 ( Figure 3d ) suggests that CTD methylation is associated with early stages of the transcription cycle

. Taken together, our results suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters, is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription, and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes.

. 72–0. 86 ). These correlations suggest that CTD-K7 methylation is related to RNAPII occupancy at gene promoters, and not directly to elongating complexes. Similar results are obtained with a more inclusive correlation analysis using the full list of non-overlapping active genes irrespective of 8WG16 peak distance to TSS ( n = 4271 ), and including histone modifications and CpG content ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1a ). 10. 7554/eLife. 11215. 013Figure 6

. This group of genes is associated with poised RNAPII complexes in mouse ES cells, which are characterized by an unusual CTD state phosphorylated at S5 but not at S7 or S2, and that does not lead to mRNA expression ( Brookes et al., 2012; Stock et al., 2007; Tee et al., 2014 )

. Genes with similar promoter occupancy of RNAPII but which have higher levels of K7me2 relative to K7ac are significantly less expressed than genes that have higher levels of K7ac relative to K7me2. This suggests that a balance between K7 modifications fine-tunes gene expression levels. Further studies are required to explore the enzymatic activities that methylate and demethylate CTD-K7 residues, as well as the readers of methylated CTD-K7

Transcription of protein-coding genes is a complex process involving a sequence of RNA processing events that occur at different stages of the transcription cycle. Co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery is modulated through a complex array of post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNAPII

. Taken together, these results reinforce the observation that K7me1 and K7me2 are early transcription marks that are present at actively transcribed genes, but have negative contribution to mRNA levels, and raise the possibility that a balance between K7 methylation and K7 acetylation might define the extent of productive elongation at active genes

., 2013 ). Lysine acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histone proteins, where it is often counter-balanced by methylation, with clear roles in regulation of gene expression and repression ( Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011; Wozniak and Strahl, 2014 ). To investigate whether K7 methylation could counteract K7 acetylation of RNAPII, we developed specific monoclonal antibodies using CTD peptides methylated on K7

. 55 ) and S7p ( 0. 49; Figure 6a ). In contrast, the enrichment levels of K7me1 and K7me2 at gene promoters ( which are highly self-correlated, 0. 93 ) poorly correlate with S2p or mRNA ( 0. 31–0. 45 ), but highly correlate with modifications associated with initiation and early elongation ( unphosphorylated RNAPII, S5p and S7p; 0. 72–0. 86 )

. One interesting aspect that emerges from studying CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation is that the two marks may compete for the eight available K7 residues at the CTD and thereby regulate gene expression levels. We observed that the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac at active promoters is inversely related to gene expression

. CTD-K7 methylation levels are highly correlated with promoter levels of unmodified S2, S7p, and S5p, but are uncoupled from mRNA expression and S2p abundance. In contrast, we find that CTD-K7 acetylation expands downstream of promoter regions into gene bodies, and highly correlates with S2p and mRNA levels

. To investigate whether the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters could be predictive of gene expression, we calculated the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac and investigated how it relates to mature and nascent RNA levels. We find that the K7me2/K7ac ratio negatively correlates with mRNA expression ( Spearman’s correlation coefficient -0. 35; Figure 7a, Figure 7—figure supplement 1a )

., 1996 ). CTD-K7 residues were mutated into serine ( S7 ) residues to restore the consensus sequence of the CTD heptapeptide. We avoided the more traditional lysine to arginine substitution, as a non-canonical arginine residue is present at the CTD in position 7 of repeat 31 and undergoes methylation in vivo ( Sims et al., 2011 ). Therefore, artificial expansion of R7 residues in the CTD could confound our investigation of CTD-K7 methylation. 10. 7554/eLife. 11215. 004Figure 2

. To explore the temporal sequence of CTD modifications during the transcription cycle and how they predict gene expression levels, we performed extensive correlation analyses between different RNAPII modifications ( Figure 6 ). We focused on active genes using a refined group of genes which are ( i ) positive for S5p, S7p and S2p, ( ii ) expressed at the mRNA level, and ( iii ) negative for the repressive histone modifications H3K27me3 and H2Aub1

., 2013 ), suggesting that K7 methylation may precede K7 acetylation during the transcription cycle. 10. 7554/eLife. 11215. 008Figure 4. Interplay between C-K methylation and acetylation at the CTD of RNAPI in the regulation of gene expression. The balance between K7 methylation and K acetylation at the CTD of RNAPI may fine-tune gene expression levels, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription and acetylation with higher levels of expression. This is supported by the inverse correlation between the ratio of Kme and Kac and mRNA levels ( Figure 7, Figure— supplement 1 ) and the observation that genes with higher levels of K2 relative to K are less expressed than those with higher levels of K relative to K2 ( Figure 6— supplement 2 )

    Title: Post-transcriptional regulation of satellite cell quiescence by TTP-mediated mRNA decay
    Abstract: Skeletal muscle satellite cells in their niche are quiescent and upon muscle injury, exit quiescence, proliferate to repair muscle tissue, and self-renew to replenish the satellite cell population. To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3′ untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis.

   . Since MyoD up-regulates its own transcription, muscle injury would trigger a rapid feed-forward loop resulting in MyoD expression driving SCs to commit to myoblasts. Additionally, we propose that TTP may be involved in down regulation of MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03390

. 10. 7554/eLife. 03390. 015Figure 6. Inhibition of TTP by p38α/β MAPK initiates a feed-forward circuit that commits SCs to the myogenic lineage. Muscle regeneration requires SCs to rapidly exit from quiescence but to also renew the quiescent SC population upon completion of regeneration. We propose that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38α/β MAPK is rapidly activated resulting in phosphorylation of TTP

., 2012 ). Transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases were highly represented, supporting a critical role for post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis ( Farina et al., 2012 ). The involvement of p38α/β MAPK signaling in SC activation ( Jones et al., 2005 ), asymmetric SC division ( Troy et al., 2012 ) and loss of SC function during aging ( Bernet et al

. TTP may be required for SC quiescence as ( 1 ) TTP is present in quiescent SCs, ( 2 ) TTP is rapidly inhibited by p38α/β MAPK signaling within minutes of SC activation, and ( 3 ) active TTP reduces the half-life of MyoD mRNA. Therefore, loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression, and aberrant cell cycle entry

. The rapid p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation ( inactivation ) of TTP upon SC activation suggests that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, TTP inactivation preceding MyoD up-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets

. The behavior of SCs from aged mice is consistent with p38α/β MAPK-mediated regulation of MyoD as these SCs predominately commit to myogenesis with an accompanying reduction in self-renewal, consistent with their elevated p38α/β MAPK activity ( Bernet et al., 2014; Cosgrove et al., 2014 ). Although MyoD mRNA appears to be a TTP target, TTP likely regulates other mRNAs with AU-rich sites involved in maintenance of SC quiescence

., 2001 ). Transcripts encoding TTP family members are among the fastest declining and dynamically regulated mRNAs following SC activation, where the transcripts initially decline and then are re-expressed ( Farina et al., 2012 ). Consistent with this observation, we identified the MyoD 3′ UTR as a TTP substrate, and show that p38α/β MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of TTP regulates MyoD mRNA decay, thereby regulating SC activation

., 2012; Crist et al., 2012 ). Here, we propose that SC quiescence is actively maintained by mRNA decay, an additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, via the Tis11 family of RNA binding proteins ( Figure 6 ). Together, these studies suggest that a host of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms maintain the quiescent state of skeletal muscle stem cells and represent an efficient and rapid method for tissue-specific stem cell responses. 10. 7554/eLife. 03390

Skeletal muscle satellite cells ( SCs ) are maintained as a quiescent stem cell population ( Schultz, 1976 ) possessing minimal cytoplasm, condensed chromatin, and few ribosomes ( Wakayama et al., 1979 ). Upon muscle injury, SCs activate and then enter S-phase to generate a proliferating myoblast population that differentiates, repairs skeletal muscle tissue, and self-renews to replenish the stem cell pool ( Cornelison et al., 2001 )

. SC quiescence is maintained by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms including miRNA-mediated inhibition of Myf5 translation ( Crist et al., 2012 ) and Dek translation ( Cheung et al., 2012 ). Here, we show that in addition to Myf5 and Pax3 ( Boutet et al., 2012 ), MyoD mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally via a distinct regulatory mechanism whereby MyoD mRNA is targeted for rapid decay in quiescent SCs

. Furthermore, the Tis11 family members Brf1 and Brf2 were also down-regulated upon SC activation. Ongoing work is focused on identification and characterization of additional TTP/Tis11 targets and their involvement in maintenance of SC quiescence. In the absence of muscle injury, SC-specific TTP knockdown increased MyoD+ cells, presumably at the expense of Pax7+ progenitor cells

. The increase in MyoD+ cells was accompanied by an increase in mCherry+ myofibers when compared to controls where SCs were infected with scrambled shRNAs. Thus, TTP inhibition breaks SC quiescence in uninjured muscle, providing strong evidence for the involvement of TTP in regulating SC homeostasis. Similarly, post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by miR-489 maintains SC quiescence, suggesting Dek and potentially other miR-489 targets regulate SC homeostasis ( Cheung et al., 2012 )

. The mCherry+ cells in control muscles infected with the scrambled shRNA expressing RCAS were >95% Pax7+ with fewer than 5% of the mCherry+ cells immunoreactive for MyoD ( Figure 5D–F ). In contrast, a >threefold increase in MyoD+ immunoreactivity was observed mCherry+ cells in shTTPmix-infected muscle ( Figure 5D, F ). Thus, SC-specific TTP knockdown breaks SC quiescence, promoting precocious SC activation and enhancing cell fusion with existing myofibers in the absence of muscle injury

., 2001 ). Induction of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory transcription factor, is a critical component of this activation cascade. Prior to MyoD induction, and immediately upon satellite cell activation, the p38α/β MAPK pathway is activated, serving as a molecular switch ( Jones et al., 2005 ). In a subset of SCs, p38α/β is asymmetrically activated during cell division to promote SC self-renewal and re-acquisition of quiescence ( Troy et al., 2012 )

. Thus, global loss of TTP appears sufficient to drive a low-level injury response in skeletal muscle in the absence of an overt physical or chemical insult. 10. 7554/eLife. 03390. 012Figure 5. TTP loss-of-function promotes promiscuous SC activation. ( A–C ) Uninjured TA muscle sections from wild type ( WT ), TTP knockout, and TTP/TNFR1/2 triple knockout mice ( 3KO ) were stained for MyoD ( red ) to identify cells committed to myogenesis

. ( B ) TTP reduces the half-life of a WTß-MyoD reporter mRNA but is stabilized in the presence of constitutively active MAPKAPK-2

. Therefore our data, combined with recent reports of miRNA-mediated regulation of SC quiescence ( Cheung et al., 2012; Crist et al., 2012 ), identify post-transcriptional gene regulation as an effective and potent means of maintaining SC homeostasis.

    Title: Macrophage dysfunction initiates colitis during weaning of infant mice lacking the interleukin-10 receptor
    Abstract: Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor ( IL10R ) develop very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Whether IL10R regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy is unknown. Here we show that although signs of colitis are absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and accompanying diversification of the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Interestingly, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis.

    Supporting Text:
   . Understanding the factors that drive this response, and delineating how IL10 inhibits this, could uncover essential pathways that regulate the development of intestinal inflammation in infants. A central question raised by this study is why colonic inflammation in IL10R-deficient mice is first detected in the third week of life

. To address these issues, we performed detailed time-series experiments using IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate co-housed controls, and evaluated histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the LP, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age. We used clodronate depletion to investigate the role of colonic MΦs in colonic inflammation that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice

. Therefore, it appears unlikely that a direct effect of IL10R signaling on the microbiome is responsible for the colitis that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice. In contrast, it was previously reported that IL10-deficient and WT mice exhibit significant differences in microbial diversity and composition ( Maharshak et al., 2013 )

. Our data demonstrate that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling.

., 2013; Shouval et al., 2014a; Kotlarz et al., 2012 ), suggesting that the IL10/IL10R pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy. Thus, modeling infantile-onset colitis in mice that lack functional IL10R signaling could lead to significant advances in our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases

. Interestingly, while treatment with antibiotics suppressed inflammation in 3–4 week old mice lacking the IL10R, we found no evidence that IL10R regulated microbiota composition during infancy. These results strongly support a model in which IL10R signaling is required on MΦs to prevent a microbiota-driven inflammatory response that develops during the third week of infant life

., 2014a; Glocker et al., 2011 ). However, because commonly used mouse models lacking IL10R signaling do not exhibit overt signs of colitis until adulthood, there is a paucity of information regarding requirements for IL10R signaling during infancy. Given the rapid developmental changes in intestinal physiology, immune system responsiveness, diet, and the microbiome that occur during the first weeks of life ( Arrieta et al., 2014; Pantoja-Feliciano et al

., 1998; Zigmond et al., 2014 ). Given that colitis in infants lacking functional IL10R is an aggressive disease that presents very early in life ( Glocker et al., 2009; Shouval et al., 2014a ), it is unclear whether the same cellular mechanisms observed in adult mice lacking IL10R are in fact operating within the time frame of infant development

. While further directed experiments are still needed to address the primary function of IL10R in resident colonic MΦs during infant development, it is enticing to speculate that the intestinal inflammation observed in infants lacking IL10R signaling may be based on the inability of host MΦs to control the inflammatory potential of the expanding intestinal microbiota

. In addition, clodronate treatment led to significantly abrogated expression of genes encoding for proinflammatory effector cytokines including Il12b, Ifng, Il17a, and Il1b ( Figure 4F ) in the colons of Il10rb-/- mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the LP MΦs are important effectors of colonic inflammatory response in the absence of IL10R signaling in infant mice. 10. 7554/eLife. 27652. 012Figure 4

. However, it is important to note that as we did not directly compare the phenotype of mice lacking IL10Rα and IL10Rβ, there may be difference in the phenotype of mice lacking these two components based on differing functions of these receptor components themselves, or conversely due to differences in genetic background or resident microbiota in these two strains. 10. 7554/eLife. 27652. 013Figure 5. IL10Rα is necessary to prevent intestinal inflammation in infant mice

. Collectively, these data indicate that microbiota are a key factor that regulate MΦ function and promote colonic inflammation during early postnatal development in Il10rb-/- mice. In addition, the specificity of antibiotics indicate that Gram-negative bacteria likely represent key effectors of the inflammatory response observed in Il10rb-/- mice during this developmental window

., 2014 ) and there is ample evidence that the microbiota is intimately involved in the development of colitis in many susceptible mouse models including mice lacking IL10 signaling ( Kang et al., 2008; Sellon et al., 1998 ). Taken together, these studies imply that IL10R signaling on intestinal MΦs prevents microbially-driven recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes and the development of intestinal inflammation

. Together, these data confirm that IL10Rα signaling on MΦs is necessary to protect from intestinal inflammation during murine infant development and that IL10Rα modulates the phenotype of LP MΦs in a cell-intrinsic fashion. 10. 7554/eLife. 27652. 014Figure 6. Macrophage-specific IL10Rα is necessary to prevent intestinal inflammation in infant mice. ( A ) Representative gross macroscopic images of colon from 6 week old mice

., 2014b, 2016; Zigmond et al., 2014 ). In addition, we have shown excessive accumulation of inflammatory Ly6C+ monocytes within the colons of colitic IL10R-deficient mice as well as defects in the differentiation of both murine and human anti-inflammatory macrophages ( MΦs ) defective in IL10R signaling ( Shouval et al., 2014b ). It has previously been shown that intestinal microbiota promotes the accumulation of Ly6C+ monocytes within the lamina propria ( LP ) ( Bain et al

. 05 ). These findings suggest that IL10Rβ does not directly regulate microbiota composition, and any ecosystem alterations in Il10rb-/- mice are likely secondary to inflammation induced by the pathogen. Thus, it appears unlikely that IL10R is necessary to control dysbiosis, or that dysbiosis is necessary to promote colitis in infant IL10R-deficient mice.

. Interestingly, concomitant enhanced expression of Il10 also started at 3 weeks in both Il10rb-/- and control mice, suggesting that the induction of IL10 in control mice is itself necessary to curtail a proinflammatory stimulus that begins in the third week of life. To examine the cellular basis for inflammatory responses observed within the colon of infant Il10rb-/- mice, we performed extensive immunophenotyping of colonic LP cells isolated from infant mice at 2 and 3 weeks of age

To identify the onset of colitis in IL10R deficiency, we examined the kinetics of intestinal inflammation from early post-natal life through adulthood in Il10rb-/- mice ( 129SvEv background ) under specific pathogen-free ( SPF ) conditions. As shown by H and E staining of distal colonic sections in Figure 1A, colonic inflammatory infiltrates could be detected in Il10rb-/- but not littermate Il10rb+/- ( control ) mice by the third week of life

. Here we demonstrate that although there are no signs of inflammation within the intestine of IL10R-deficient mice less than 14 days of age, IL10R is required to prevent an intestinal inflammatory response that emerges during the third week of life. Consistent with previous work suggesting that IL10R signaling in MΦs prevents excessive lower bowel inflammation in various models ( Li et al., 2015; Shouval et al., 2014b; Zigmond et al

., 2008; Kühn et al., 1993; Spencer et al., 1998 ), strongly supporting the concept that IL10 signaling plays a central role in preventing colitis in infant mice lacking ILR.

    Title: A tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, promotes siRNA production at piRNA-targeted mRNAs in C. elegans
    Abstract: piRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, regulation of piRNA target genes is mediated by the mutator complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex are unknown. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. Interestingly, SIMR-1 also localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. Thus, our data suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.

    Supporting Text:
   . Here we demonstrate that the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, is required at a step between the piRNA pathway to the mutator complex. SIMR-1 may function similarly to how Krimper coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping pong piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila ( Webster et al., 2015 ), but in this case bridging the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans piRNA silencing pathway

. elegans piRNA silencing pathway. Finally, SIMR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

. Therefore, this work identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

. In C. elegans, a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the mutator complex, which includes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, synthesizes secondary downstream siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing ( Das et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012; Bagijn et al., 2012; Shirayama et al., 2012; Ashe et al., 2012 )

. elegans, several of which localize at or near P granules, including GLH-1, –2, −3, –4, DDX-19, LAF-1, MUT-14, and VBH-1 ( Supplementary file 1 ). One of these proteins could potentially serve a function similar to RDE-12, in the shuttling of piRNA-targeted mRNAs into SIMR-1 foci and ultimately to Mutator foci. In conclusion, numerous proteins have been identified in C. elegans that are required for piRNA transcription, trimming, and modification ( Kamminga et al

. elegans genes. siRNAs can be classified based on their Argonaute protein binding partner and the other proteins or protein complexes required for their biogenesis. To identify the small RNA pathway ( s ) in which SIMR-1 plays a role, we looked at the change in total small RNA levels at groups of genes known to be targets of the CSR-1, mutator, piRNA, or ERGO-1 pathways in simr-1 mutants compared to wild-type at both 20°C and a single generation at 25°C ( Lee et al

. Specifically, through proteomic analysis of MUT-16, we identified an uncharacterized Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1 ( siRNA-defective and mortal germline ). Unlike mut-16 mutants, simr-1 mutants are not defective in exogenous RNAi, but do have a transgenerational sterility phenotype at elevated temperature. Interestingly, while SIMR-1 is not required for production of piRNAs or the expression of PRG-1, simr-1 mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs from many piRNA-target loci

. These discoveries have led to an intriguing model where the small RNA pathway is temporally and spatially organized into membrane-less organelles, with distinct steps of the silencing pathway occurring in neighboring condensates, while still allowing for trafficking of RNAs and perhaps some proteins between condensates. Here we identify a protein required to coordinate RNA silencing between the piRNA pathway in P granules and siRNA amplification in Mutator foci

. The dynamic nature of these various condensates could facilitate exchange of RNAs or protein components between compartments, which may explain how piRNA pathway proteins, SIMR-1, and the mutator complex could occupy distinct substructures while facilitating regulation of the same mRNA target genes

. Because SIMR-1 promotes siRNA biogenesis at piRNA target genes, we also examined the colocalization of SIMR-1 and PRG-1, which has previously been shown to localize to P granules ( Batista et al., 2008; Wang and Reinke, 2008 ). Similar to what we observed with PGL-1, PRG-1 is localized adjacent to but not coincident with SIMR-1 foci ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A )

. Together, these data show that the extended Tudor domain is essential for SIMR-1 function, and that disruption of the Tudor domain results in loss of SIMR-1 germline foci and causes a Mrt phenotype similar to that of the simr-1 deletion allele. To comprehensively characterize the role of SIMR-1 in C. elegans endogenous small RNA pathways, we generated small RNA libraries from wild-type and simr-1 mutants at 20°C and after culturing for one, two, seven, or 10 generations at 25°C

. These data suggest that SIMR-1 may act at a step in between PRG-1 targeting and siRNA biogenesis by the mutator complex. Finally, we demonstrate that SIMR-1 localizes to perinuclear foci, adjacent to, but distinct from Mutator foci, P granules and Z granules, which we name SIMR foci

., 2012; Montgomery et al., 2012; Billi et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2016; Weick et al., 2014; de Albuquerque et al., 2014; Kasper et al., 2014; Cordeiro Rodrigues et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019 ), however, how mRNAs travel between the piRNA pathway, required for mRNA recognition, to the mutator pathway, necessary for siRNA production has remained a mystery

. This reduction of siRNAs at piRNA-target genes could result from a loss of piRNAs in the simr-1 mutant animals, or alternatively, piRNAs could be expressed at wild-type levels and only the downstream siRNAs could be affected. To address these possibilities, we counted the number of reads mapping to annotated piRNA loci in wild-type and simr-1 mutants

. Furthermore, SIMR-1 is not required for PRG-1 localization or expression, and PRG-1 is not required for SIMR-1 localization ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C ). These data indicate that, while SIMR-1 and PRG-1 function in the same pathway to mediate siRNA biogenesis at piRNA target genes, they do not colocalize and are not required for one another’s localization or expression

. These data indicate that a mutation in simr-1, like prg-1, is sufficient to desilence a sensitized piRNA sensor strain, but cannot reactivate a piRNA sensor silenced by RNAe. To examine the role of SIMR-1 in other small RNA pathways, we next introduced a simr-1 mutant into the 22G-siR1 sensor which is sensitive to perturbations in the ERGO-1 26G-siRNA pathway and the downstream mutator pathway ( Montgomery et al., 2012 )

., 2018a; Wu et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019 ). Specifically, we selected genes predicted to be targets for our simr-1-depleted piRNAs by piRTarBase using relaxed piRNA targeting rules and identified by CLASH data ( Supplementary file 4 ). Of the 37 predicted target genes for our simr-1-depleted piRNAs, only five have reduced small RNAs in simr-1 mutants ( Supplementary file 4 ), indicating that the simr-1-depleted piRNAs are not a major driver of siRNA depletion in simr-1 mutants

. RDE-12 localizes to both RSD-6 foci and P granules, suggesting it can traverse the boundary between perinuclear condensates, potentially shuttling pi-targeted mRNAs to SIM-1 foci and Mut foci for siRNA amplification by the mutator.

    Title: AMPA receptor mediated synaptic excitation drives state-dependent bursting in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae
    Abstract: Purkinje neurons are central to cerebellar function and show membrane bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. The existence of bistability in vivo in awake animals is disputed. Here, by recording intracellularly from Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), we unequivocally demonstrate bistability in these neurons. Tonic firing was seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. In addition, Purkinje neurons could switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. While GABAAR or NMDAR were not required for bursting, activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers ( CFs ) was sufficient to trigger bursts. Further, by recording Purkinje neuron membrane potential intracellularly, and motor neuron spikes extracellularly, we show that initiation of motor neuron spiking is correlated with increased incidence of CF EPSPs and membrane depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until late larval stages.

   . Secondly, like in mammalian Purkinje neurons, two kinds of glutamatergic excitation are observed: strong excitation from CFs and weak excitation from PFs, both mediated by AMPA receptors ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). Lastly, we demonstrated bistability in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae. Though bistability in Purkinje neurons has been reported in vitro in amniotes ( Llinás and Sugimori, 1980; Oldfield et al., 2010 ) and in vivo under anesthesia in rodents ( Loewenstein et al

We have recorded from Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish from 4 dpf to 19 dpf. This preparation allows us to study intracellular membrane potential dynamics of Purkinje neurons in vivo in the context of fictive motor output. However, because it is a larval animal, it is possible that the bistability that we observe is the property of a developing network and that it may not be present in the mature cerebellum of the adult

. We show that zebrafish Purkinje neurons exhibit membrane bistability in vivo and that the state changes are dependent on AMPAR-mediated CF inputs.

. Based on the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum, it seems reasonable to conclude that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals. Our experiments indicate that in vivo, Purkinje neurons can be found either in the tonic or bursting mode and that they spontaneously toggle from one mode to another

. By comparison with in vitro recordings of Purkinje neurons in the central lobe of mormyrid fish ( Han and Bell, 2003; de Ruiter et al., 2006 ), we concluded that the narrow spikes were sodium-dependent action potentials, broad spikes were calcium-mediated spikes and the large amplitude events were CF EPSPs. Nevertheless, since these are the first intracellular recordings from zebrafish Purkinje neurons, we next confirmed that this was indeed the case. 10. 7554/eLife. 09158

. When Purkinje neurons are in the ‘down’ state, strong AMPAR-mediated excitation from the CFs is sufficient to trigger bursts. In zebrafish, GABAergic inhibition or NMDAR-dependent excitation seem not to be critical for generating bursts. Both a hyperpolarized membrane potential and AMPAR-mediated CF-activation were required for triggering bursts, suggesting that CF-EPSPs activate voltage-dependent conductances in the Purkinje neuron to trigger bursts

. Similar to mammalian neurons, spontaneous firing appears to be an intrinsic property of zebrafish Purkinje neurons as these neurons continue to fire at high rates even when fast synaptic transmission is blocked, as has been shown in rodent Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices ( Häusser and Clark, 1997 )

., 1979; Kitamura and Häusser, 2011 ). Being the sole output neuron of the cerebellar cortex, the firing patterns of Purkinje neurons are functionally significant for motor co-ordination and motor learning ( Thach, 1968; Medina, 2011; Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Hewitt et al., 2015 ). In addition, mammalian Purkinje neurons exhibit membrane bistability in vitro ( Llinás and Sugimori, 1980; Oldfield et al., 2010 ) and in vivo under anesthesia ( Loewenstein et al

. These studies provide support to the idea that the functioning of the larval cerebellum is analogous to its function in the adult and that the activity patterns we recorded are functionally relevant in the larva and in the adult. Here, we have recorded intracellularly from Purkinje neurons of the zebrafish for the first time and we observe several shared as well as unique features in its physiology in comparison to that reported in mammals

. Further experiments are needed to tease out the ionic basis of the bursts triggered by CF-EPSPs. We report here that the three elements of spontaneous activity in zebrafish Purkinje neurons, namely, sodium spikes, calcium spikes and CF-EPSPs are all present within a day after they differentiate ( Figure 9 ). These three properties seem to persist at least until late larval stages

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09158. 010 The large amplitude events that we observed in zebrafish Purkinje neurons appeared very similar in shape and amplitude to the all or none CF EPSPs previously recorded in vitro in Purkinje neurons in the central lobe of the cerebellum of mormyrid fish ( Han and Bell, 2003; de Ruiter et al., 2006 )

., 2005; Schonewille et al., 2006 ), there has been disagreement on whether it occurs in vivo under ‘awake’ conditions ( Schonewille et al., 2006; Yartsev et al., 2009; Engbers et al., 2013 ). The zebrafish larval preparation allows us to perform intracellular recordings of membrane potential in the absence of anesthesia. Under these conditions, we observed membrane bistability and toggling between ‘up’ and ‘down’ states

., 2009; Takeuchi et al., 2015; Hamling et al., 2015 ). Previous studies using calcium imaging and extracellular recording have shown that Purkinje neurons are electrically active at 6–7 dpf ( Ahrens et al., 2012; Hsieh et al., 2014; Matsui et al., 2014 ). Here, we undertake a thorough characterization of spontaneous activity patterns in Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish

. Unlike mammalian Purkinje neurons, zebrafish larval Purkinje neurons do not exhibit complex spikes. Instead, they show large amplitude all-or-none CF EPSPs and broad calcium spikes. In spite of such major differences, we also identified several similarities that have been evolutionarily conserved

. It is not yet clear when the process of synapse elimination is complete in zebrafish but our data suggest a gradual decrease in the number of CF synapses onto single Purkinje neurons between 4 dpf and 19 dpf. Further morphological and physiological experiments are required to determine the earliest stage at which Purkinje neurons are innervated by single CF. We have shown that Purkinje neuron bursts are highly correlated with motor neuronal spikes

., 2004 ) and birds ( Pakan et al., 2007; Iwaniuk et al., 2009; Corfield et al., 2015; Vibulyaseck et al., 2015 ). We use the aldoca promoter to fluorescently label Purkinje neurons specifically so as to target them for whole-cell patch clamp recordings ( Tanabe et al., 2010; Takeuchi et al., 2015 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09158. 003Figure 1. Zebrafish cerebellar circuitry and experimental preparation. ( A ) Schematic of the cerebellar circuitry in zebrafish

., 2008; Hashimoto and Hibi, 2012 ). As in mammals, Purkinje neurons in zebrafish also receive excitatory inputs from parallel fibers ( PFs ) and climbing fibers ( CFs ) and inhibition from stellate cells ( Figure 1A ). Purkinje neurons in zebrafish, similar to mammalian Purkinje neurons, also have large planar dendritic arbors decorated with spines ( Miyamura and Nakayasu, 2001 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09158. 016 We next investigated whether the bistable behavior that we report here can be observed in early larval stages. We recorded at 4 dpf, which is the earliest time point when Purkinje neurons can be unequivocally identified. At this stage, Purje neurons exhibit bistability in response to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection ( Figure 3 ). We also observed bistability at 7 dpf and 10 dpf (data not shown ), indicating that bistability is present at least until late larval stages

Intracellular recordings from zraf Purkin neurons show that bistability in vivo and bistability is dependent on AMPA receptor activation by climbing fibers (CFs). The bistability in Purje neurons has been reported in vitro in amni (lin and Sugori 1980; Old et al 2010 ) and in vivo under anesthesia (Loew et al 2008 ) but not in awake animals. Here we show bistability in larval zraf Purkin neurons and bist is dependent on AMPAR activation by CFs. The bist in Purje neurons is conserved from fish to mammals as suggested by the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum. Our results indicate that Purje can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between the two modes spontaneously. The bist in Purje is correlated with motor neuron spikes as shown by recording Purje membrane potential intracellularly and motor spikes extracellularly. The bist in Purje is present at least until larval stages as shown by recording Purje at 4 dp 7 dp and 19 dp. The bist in Purje is dependent on AMPAR activation by CFs and not GABA or NMDAR. The bist in Purje is conserved from fish to mammals as suggested by the conservation of other structural and functional properties of cerebellum. The bist in Purje is correlated with motor spikes as shown by recording Purje potential intracellular and spikes extracellular.

    Title: Principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis
    Abstract: Force generation by actin assembly shapes cellular membranes. An experimentally constrained multiscale model shows that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension. Around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. A newly developed molecule-counting method determined that ~200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit. Elastic energy stored in bent filaments, whose presence was confirmed by cryo-electron tomography, contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. Thus, spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints.

   ., in preparation ), whereas cells with low membrane tension carry out endocytosis even with low Arp2/3 complex activity, consistent with experimental observations ( Boulant et al., 2011 ). We hypothesized that actin network self-organization arising from the broad Hip1R distribution around the pit ( Figure 4 ) and filament bending ( Figure 5 ) might allow for the endocytic actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under elevated loads ( Figure 7 )

., 2007 ). We integrated modeling and quantitative cellular measurements to show that a minimal actin network composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex and capping protein, with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements, is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension

We combined a continuum membrane mechanics model with filament-based simulations of actin polymerization coupled to endocytic pit internalization to develop a multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis

. Our results show that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension. Actin filament self-organization and bending, which arise from the spatial distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allow the actin network to adapt to changing loads

. Thus, we determined that ~200 molecules of Arp2/3 complex accumulate at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites over time ( Figure 2I ). Incorporating the Arp2/3 molecule number we determined experimentally into our multiscale model, we next conducted simulations of the model to investigate the spatial organization of actin and force generation capacity of the endocytic network ( Figure 3 ). Strikingly, the actin network self-organized around the endocytic pit

., 2016; Kaplan et al., in preparation ). The simple spring-like relationship uncovered above between force and endocytic pit internalization ( Figure 1D ) allowed us to simplify our mechanical treatment of the plasma membrane while modeling individual actin filaments and actin-binding proteins with realistic kinetics and mechanics ( Figure 1E–G, Supplementary file 3 ). We used Cytosim ( Nedelec and Foethke, 2007 ) to construct a filament-based model of the endocytic actin network

. Our observations therefore establish an important principle for actin organization in endocytosis: the positions of active Arp2/3 complexes are critical for organizing the actin network and determining the direction of force production, while the Hip1R linker distribution is critical for recruiting mother filaments that activate the Arp2/3 complex to direct filament growth to the area surrounding the base of the pit

. We anticipate that the mechanistic insights gained for actin in mammalian endocytosis will also apply to a variety of local membrane-bending processes carried out by branched actin throughout the cell.

. Our finding that self-organized endocytic actin networks grow toward the base of the pit prompted us to explore the molecular mechanism by which actin filaments self-organize. Actin dynamics in association with the endocytic machinery can be thought of as a polymerization engine constrained by two spatial boundary conditions -- active Arp2/3 complex at the base of the pit ( Almeida-Souza et al., 2018; Idrissi et al., 2008; Kaksonen et al., 2003; Mund et al., 2018; Picco et al

., 2018; Scott et al., 2018 ). Future work will investigate the relationship between coat topology and actin forces during the initiation of endocytosis. Third, we showed a significant fraction of endocytic actin filaments bend under force. We predict that the bent filaments, whose existence we confirmed by cryo-electron tomography of intact cells, contribute to successful endocytic internalization in at least two ways

. Thus, we found that in addition to generating force actively by filament growth ( Figure 3 ), the endocytic actin network stores potential energy in the form of bent filaments that can promote internalization even after filaments have stopped growing. We next investigated how inhibiting the activity of Arp2/3 complex would affect endocytosis ( Figure 6 )

. Indeed, we found bent actin filaments present at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, between the clathrin coat ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) and the base of the pit ( Figure 5B and Figure 5—video 1 ), in extended ‘U’-shaped clathrin-coated pits similar to the stage modeled in our simulations ( Figure 5C–D ). What could be a functional consequence of such bent filaments? We hypothesized that the bent actin filaments store elastic energy that promotes endocytic internalization

. Approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes constitutively assemble at sites of endocytosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Endocytic actin filaments self-organize into a radial dendritic array, in which filaments grow toward the base of the pit. These filaments bend and store elastic energy, which supports internalization

. Understanding the mechanical function and load adaptation in the ‘soft’ regime studied here is likely to apply to a variety of cellular membrane bending processes employing branched actin networks, including the assembly and maturation of endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes ( Rottner et al., 2017 ). Finally, we acknowledge that our model represents a minimal core actin machinery necessary for endocytic internalization in mammalian cells

. We used Cytosim ( Nedelec and Foethke, 2007 ) to model the polymerization of a branched actin network coupled to the internalization of a clathrin-coated pit. This approach simplified the pit as a bead attached to a flat boundary ( the plasma membrane ) by a spring. This assumption of a linear force-extension relationship was validated in Figure 1. Actin filaments and actin-binding proteins ( Arp2/3 complex, Hip1R ) were explicitly simulated as individual objects ( agents )

We combined a continuum-mechanics model of the plasma membrane, an agent-based model of actin filament dynamics, quantitative fluorescence microscopy, and electron tomography in cells to determine the molecular mechanism by which branched actin networks produce force during mammalian clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Figure 1, Scheme 1 ). First, we used a continuum-mechanics model of the plasma membrane ( Alimohamadi et al., 2018; Hassinger et al., 2017; Rangamani et al

. The endocytic actin network adapts to changes in membrane tension by driving more filaments to the base of the pit and increasing filament bending, which supports a higher load and nucleates more actin filaments. Four lines of experimental evidence support our model ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ). Two pieces of evidence serve as model validation based on published data and two more are based on experiments conducted in this study

. Because we and others previously modeled that membrane tension plays an important role in membrane bending during the formation of an endocytic pit ( Hassinger et al., 2017; Rangamani et al., 2014; Walani et al., 2014 ) we next varied the value of membrane tension in simulations to understand the relationship between tension, actin filament bending, and actin assembly ( Figure 7A )

. Given that self-organized actin filaments help to nucleate new actin filaments that grow toward the base of the pit, questions remained about how these filaments contribute to and sustain force production. Closer examination of the simulations revealed that long actin filaments bend between their attachment sites in the clathrin coat and the base of the pit as a result of assembly confined by the membrane at the base of the pit ( Figure 5A )

. Therefore, we sought to understand how endocytic actin networks adapt to changes in membrane tension. We hypothesized that actin filaments store elastic energy in the form of bent filaments that contribute to endytic internalization even after filaments have stopped growing ( Figure 7 ). We used cryo-electron tomography to confirm the presence of bent actin filaments at sites of clrin-mediated endocyt ( Figure 5— supplement 1 ) and the base of the pit ( Figure 5 and Figure— video 1 ) in ‘’U’-shaped clath-coated pits similar to those modeled in simulations ( Figure 5–D )

    Title: A plasma membrane template for macropinocytic cups
    Abstract: Macropinocytosis is a fundamental mechanism that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles. It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. We show that macropinocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP3, active Ras and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP3 patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.

    Supporting Text:
    Macropinosomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization. They contain a central patch of activated Ras and PIP3 throughout their life and we find that in Dictyostelium, this patch is invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge. We propose that this ring of active SCAR is recruited by the signalling patch and drives a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup

. Here we examine macropinocytosis with unprecedented 3D detail using lattice light sheet microscopy, and map the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signalling molecules including PIP3 and active Ras. This leads us to propose a new and general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane.

. As with splitting macropinocytic cups, the F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling molecules, as illustrated by active Ras in Figure 1D ( Video 4 ) and discussed later. Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body. Closure of the cup can be quite abrupt and often appears to involve the inward collapse of the rim ( Figure 1F, Video 5 ) ( Swanson et al

., 1997; Swanson, 2014 ). There is evidence that Ras activity stimulates macropinocytosis in both mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, and macropinocytic cups are associated with an intense domain, or ‘patch’, of PIP3 ( Araki et al., 2007; Parent et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2009 ), which is essential for their function ( Araki et al., 1996; Buczynski et al., 1997; Hoeller et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 1998 )

. However, this seems unlikely in the light of recent work showing that ForG contributes to the base of the macropinocytic cup, but seemingly not to the extending lip ( Junemann et al., 2016 ). Alternatively, SCAR might be moved to the periphery of Ras/PIP3 patches, perhaps by myosin-1 motors. Early work showed that myosin-1 is genetically important for macropinocytosis in Dictyostelium ( Novak et al., 1995; Titus, 2000 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20085. 010 These observations show that the large macropinocytic cups of axenic Dictyostelium cells generally form by splitting or by expanding de novo from a small focus, as in fibroblasts ( Bernitt et al., 2015 ), rather than by circularization of linear ruffles ( Welliver and Swanson, 2012 ). The smaller macropinocytic cups of wild-type cells ( see later ) also more normally form de novo or by splitting, rather than by circularization

. In axenic strains of Dictyostelium, which grow efficiently in liquid medium, macropinocytosis is massively up-regulated due to mutation of the RasGAP neurofibromatosis-1 ( NF1 ) ( Bloomfield et al., 2015; Hacker et al., 1997; Kayman and Clarke, 1983 ). These strains are thus an excellent starting point for research into the organising principles behind macropinocytic cup formation

. ( J ) SCAR is still recruited to the edges of the PIP3 patch of the small macropinocytic cups of wild-type cells. ( K–L ) Increased Ras activity leads to larger PIP3 patches and macropinocytic cups. Ras activity was increased by knock-out of the RasGAP, NF1 ( axeB is the gene encoding NF1 ). Parental DdB and knock-out cells were cultivated for 48 hr in axenic medium to maximally up-regulate macropinocytosis

. The dynamic actin that polymerises around macropinocytic cups is probably initiated by a number of nucleators, including both formins, such as ForG, which is needed for the basal part of phagocytic cups in Dictyostelium ( Junemann et al., 2016 ), and the Arp2/3 complex ( Insall et al., 2001 ), which produces dendritic structures ( Pollard and Borisy, 2003 ), like the actin that drives pseudopods

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20085. 023 In summary, a circular ruffle is not essential to create signalling patches, which appear to largely depend on Ras, with PIP3 playing a secondary though still important role. To test whether Ras plays an instructive role in macropinocytic cup morphogenesis, directly regulating their formation and size rather than acting as a remote trigger or passive participant, we examined the effect of genetically increasing Ras activity

. Time-lapse images were taken using a confocal microscope. Z-plane was set so that the basal membrane of the cell was in focus. Shown is an overlay of the fluorescence signal of a PIP3 marker with the trans-illuminated image. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20085. 028 We therefore propose that Ras patches, assisted by PI3-kinase and Rac, cause macropinocytic cup formation by recruiting rings of SCAR/WAVE complex to their edge.

., 2013; Kamphorst et al., 2015 ) and may be implicated in the spread of neurodegenerative disease within the brain ( Münch et al., 2011 ). Considering its biological importance, macropinocytosis is not well understood. Macropinosomes form from cup-shaped extensions of the plasma membrane, often known as circular ruffles, which are extended by actin polymerisation

. In summary, our work suggests a general hypothesis for the formation of cupped actin structures: that these structures arise from a ring of actin polymerization formed by recruiting actin nucleators to the periphery, but not the centre, of self-organizing patches of intense Ras and PIP3 signalling. This hypothesis suggests many new lines of experimentation.

. Thus despite changes in size and shape of PIP3 patches, SCAR remains associated with their edges, and only their edges, throughout the macropinocytic cup lifetime. It seemed possible that as a rule of cytoskeletal organization in Dictyostelium, PIP3 patches always recruit SCAR to their edges

. The SCAR signal in confocal cross sections of macropinocytic cups is too small for an accurate comparison of SCAR ring formation between mutants and therefore we used basal waves as a proxy for macropinocytic cups. Ras patches on the basal surface of PI3-kinase null cells still exclude SCAR from their centre and recruit a peripheral ring of SCAR as normal, albeit more weakly than in parental cells ( Figure 6E–F )

    Title: Structural evidence for Scc4-dependent localization of cohesin loading
    Abstract: The cohesin ring holds newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase. Initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separate complex, Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. We present here a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4. Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, we demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres.

   . We report here the structure of yeast Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2 and demonstrate that Scc4 determines cohesin localization through a conserved patch on its surface. These findings show that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. 10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 019Table 1

Tight association between sister chromatids is crucial for successful chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cell division. Cohesin, a ring-shaped protein complex that wraps around sister chromatids ( Gruber et al., 2003; Haering et al., 2008 ) is the molecular agent of sister chromatid cohesion, which persists from the time of DNA replication until anaphase. A distinct protein complex containing Scc2NIPBL and Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ) initiates linkage of cohesin with DNA ( Ciosk et al

. We have determined the structure of Scc4 bound to a minimal fragment of Scc2, and we have used this structure to derive separation of function alleles that uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres. These experiments demonstrate that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. This finding is consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway ( Nasmyth, personal communication )

. Perturbation of the conserved patch ( either scc4m35 or scc4m7 ) eliminates centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms ( Figure 4B, C, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D ). We also observed this pattern of Scc2 localization in cells progressing through S phase ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, F ), the stage at which cohesin loading is initiated ( Kogut et al

. Because the pathway that targets cohesin to centromeres requires Scc4 residues that are, in some cases, invariant across diverse eukaryotes, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting we describe is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading. Consistent with previous reports ( Fernius et al., 2013; Natsume et al

. These results suggest that interactions at the Scc4-conserved patch target Scc2/4 specifically to centromeres. To test this hypothesis, we measured Scc2 and cohesin localization by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP )

., 2004 ). In addition to initiating a connection between cohesin and chromatin, Scc2/4 determines the timing and location of cohesin loading ( Ciosk et al., 2000; Kogut et al., 2009 ). Cohesin enrichment at mitotic centromeres and pericentromeres results in tension across sister chromatids when paired kinetochores attach to opposite spindle microtubules ( Tanaka, 2000 )

. Because our ChIP-seq experiments show that Scc4 directs cohesin localization to broad centromeric domains but does not affect the local distribution of cohesin peaks, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent localization pathway we discuss here is overlaid upon local determinants of cohesin positioning on chromosomes. These local determinants would be a second level of cohesin regulation, operating at roughly the resolution of the transcriptional units in yeast

., 2000 ), and an in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading by Scc2/4 suggests that the product of this reaction is a topological protein–DNA linkage ( Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013 ). In metazoans, cohesin deposition by Scc2/4 is required for normal development ( Dorsett et al., 2005; Kawauchi et al., 2009 ), and mutations in NIPBL, the human homolog of Scc2, are dominant and causally linked to a severe developmental disorder, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome ( CDLS ) ( Krantz et al

. Moreover, centromeric Scc2-GFP signal, normally visible in wild-type cells and eliminated by CHL4 deletion ( Fernius et al., 2013 ), was lost upon mutation of the Scc4-conserved patch ( Figure 4F, G ). These results indicate that, like Chl4, a specific interaction surface on Scc4 is required to target cohesin loading to centromeres.

., 2013; Natsume et al., 2013 ), we find that the centromeric enrichment of cohesin loading is not essential for viability and that arm cohesion is unaffected in strains in which this pathway is compromised. These results probably reflect two modes for cohesin loading: one that depends on a conserved patch of Scc4 and happens at centromeres, and a second opportunistic mode that happens everywhere on the chromosome and is sufficient to support viability in the absence of the first mode

. If cohesin loading can occur in the absence of Scc4 in vitro ( Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013 ) and to some extent in the absence of the Scc4-binding region of Scc2 in vivo, why is SCC4 an essential gene? We found that supplementing the chromosomal copy of SCC2 with a plasmid coding for Scc2 or Scc2Δ1–138 complemented transcriptional repression of SCC4 ( pGAL1-SCC4 )

. If so, Scc4-conserved patch mutations would not eliminate cohesin loading but would redistribute loading events, resulting in similar cohesin levels at centromeres and on chromosome arms. This prediction is borne out both by strains bearing Scc4-conserved patch mutations and by strains lacking CHL4 ( Fernius and Marston, 2009 ). Recent reports have shown that cohesin targeting to specific locations along the chromosome arms of fission yeast ( Mizuguchi et al

., 2009; Natsume et al., 2013 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 011Figure 4. Defective centromeric cohesin loading in Scc4 conserved patch mutants. ( A ) Sister centromeres ( +2. 4CEN4-GFP ) are separated earlier and more frequently in an scc4m35 strain entering the cell cycle after a G1 arrest

. An N-terminal fragment of Scc2 ( residues 1–181 or 1–205 ) is sufficient for stable association with full-length Scc4 ( Figure 1C ). Both the truncated complex of Scc21–181/Scc4 and full-length Scc2/4 are heterodimers in solution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 003Figure 1. Purification of the cohesin-loading complex. ( A ) Domain organization of Scc2/4. Dotted lines show the Scc2–Scc4 interaction

. Moreover, GFP-labeled sister centromeres ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ), but not chromosome arms ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–G ), were separated more frequently and to greater distances in strains mutated at 5 positions in the conserved patch on Scc4 ( scc4F324A; K327A; K331A; K541A; K542A; scc4m35 ). We conclude that the conserved Scc4 patch promotes centromeric cohesion and that it does so in a manner that may also depend on CHL4

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 010 Strains lacking the Ctf19 complex subunit Chl4 ( CENP-N in humans ) are defective in centromeric cohesin loading because they cannot preferentially localize Scc2/4 to centromeres, although cohesin loads normally on chromosome arms ( Fern et al. 2013;sume et al. 2013 ). In contrast, strains lacking the S4-conserved patch are defective in cohes loading at both centromeres and chromosome arms ( Figure 4, Figure— supplement 2A–D, Figure 4— supplement 2E, F ). These results suggest that S4-dependent cohes loading is a distinct from the pathway that targets S2/4 to centrom.

    Title: Implications of being born late in the active season for growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival and fecundity
    Abstract: For hibernators, being born late in the active season may have important effects on growth and fattening, hence on winter survival and reproduction. This study investigated differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival and fecundity between early-born ( ‘EB’ ) and late-born ( ‘LB’ ) juvenile garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ). LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals. Torpor use was low during intensive growth, that are, first weeks of body mass gain, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. Finally, LB individuals showed similar patterns of hibernation, but higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice. These results suggest that torpor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots. In garden dormice, being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history.

    Supporting Text:
   . Specifically, we hypothesized that LB juvenile dormice ( i ) grow and fatten at higher rates, due to ( ii ) a higher use of torpor, and ( iii ) reach similar pre-hibernation levels of body size but a lower body fat content, leading to ( iv ) differences in hibernating patterns and mass losses overwinter, compared to EB individuals

. LB ) and food availability ( ad-libitum ‘AL’ vs. intermittently fasted ‘IF’ ) on ( i ) the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, ( ii ) the use of energy saving strategies such as daily torpor, ( iii ) the body size and body fat content prior to hibernation, ( iv ) the subsequent overwinter hibernating patterns and mass losses, and ( v ) the fecundity at the following spring of female juvenile dormice

. This result is in line with findings on common dormice, from a population also producing two litters per year, and in which no significant differences in winter survival between EB and LB juveniles were detected ( Bieber et al., 2012 ). The pre-hibernation fat reserves of LB juveniles in our study were hence sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to the five-weeks delay of hibernation start

. Further, an extensive use of torpor seemed to be incompatible with structural growth, but supports pre-hibernation fattening late in the season and the preservation of the fat reserves previously deposited prior to hibernation. This was especially the case for EB juveniles that reached higher levels of fat reserves prior to hibernation, compared to LB individuals. LB juveniles delayed their onset of hibernation by 5 weeks

. This is indeed the case in LB garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ) that grow almost twice as fast as early-born ( ‘EB’ ) individuals, reaching lower fat content prior to hibernation ( Stumpfel et al., 2017 ). One possible strategy to lower energy requirements and to minimize the impact of energetic challenges is the use of short torpor bouts during certain parts of the day, namely daily torpor ( Ruf et al., 1991 )

. Taken together, the present study shows that growth acceleration, enabled by increased food intake and reduced activity duration, acted as compensatory strategy for a late start. This led to pre-hibernation body sizes in LB juveniles that are indistinguishable from those of EB dormice

. However, LB-IF juveniles spent on average and in total less time in torpor, compared to LB-AL animals that employed less frequent but longer torpor bouts during the pre-hibernation period. This suggests that the unpredictability of food availability constrained LB-IF dormice to arouse more often to enable continuation of feeding

., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014 ). Previous studies of our group have demonstrated that LB juvenile garden dormice use daily torpor to counteract intermittent periods of fasting, showing similar trajectories of body mass gain as ad libitum-fed individuals prior to hibernation ( Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014 ). However, we presently know very little about the use of daily torpor in juvenile hibernators ( Geiser, 2008; Geiser and Brigham, 2012 )

. Further, to our knowledge no study so far has specifically investigated the effect of torpor and alternative energy-saving strategies on processes of growth and pre-hibernation fattening in hibernators according to their time of birth within the season. The garden dormouse, henceforth 'dormouse', is a small nocturnal and omnivorous rodent endemic to Europe ( Bertolino et al., 2008; Vaterlaus-Schlegel, 1997; Vogel, 1997 )

. Further, their lower body FM had no consequences for subsequent winter hibernation and survival, showing similar hibernating patterns to EB individuals. For both EB and LB juveniles, overwintering body mass loss was mainly explained by a reduction of FM, meaning that garden dormice spare their lean mass during winter hibernation

In line with our previous findings in juvenile garden dormice ( Stumpfel et al., 2017 ), our results indicate that LB dormice increased their rates of growth and body mass gain compared to EB individuals. This supports the time-stress hypothesis that accelerated growth is most likely to occur when the time available for reaching a critical developmental milestone is constrained, as for instance when born late in the reproductive season ( Clark, 1970; Dmitriew, 2011; Lee et al

. Our study further revealed that intermittent fasting had no effect on growth rate, maximal pre-hibernation body size and fat content, in either EB or LB individuals. These results are in agreement with previous findings on LB juvenile garden dormice. Indeed, LB dormice that were fasted 3 days a week reached similar body masses compared to individuals fed ad libitum ( Giroud et al., 2014 )

. Interestingly, we found that the overwintering body mass loss of juveniles was mainly accounted for a reduction of FM. This result contrasts with our previous findings on equal reductions of FM and FFM in garden dormice during winter hibernation ( see Figure 3, Giroud et al., 2014 ). However, in Giroud et al

. Further, we expected IF juveniles to employ more often and longer torpor bouts than AL fed individuals to reach similar levels of body fat content prior to hibernation. Finally, because of higher growth rates, we expected ( v ) LB juveniles to show a lower level of fecundity than EB individuals, at the subsequent reproductive season.

. Since in juvenile dormice, pre-hibernation body mass is highly correlated with body FM ( FM as a function of body mass prior to hibernation: intercept = −70. 86, slope = 1. 20 ± 0. 09, adjusted R2 = 0. 45, n = 16, p=0. 005 ) ( Stumpfel et al., 2017 ), we used body mass gain as proxy for fattening. Body mass and structural growth ( body length ) of each animal were assessed once a week, as previously described in Stumpfel et al. ( 2017 )

. In contrast, in the present study BC was assessed slightly after the peak of body mass prior to hibernation, closely reflecting BC of the animals at the onset of hibernation. Therefore, the current data provides a rigorous determination of the source ( i. e. FM and FFM ) of body mass loss overwinter in garden dormice, which almost exclusively point to FM loss during winter hibernation

. Torpor represents a flexible tool whose use strongly depends on the individual endogenous and exogenous conditions ( Humphries et al., 2003a ). Since LB dormice had in total 5 weeks less time for growth and fattening before the beginning of hibernation, they were constrained to reduce energy expenditure more strongly by reducing activity time and using torpor earlier and to a greater extent than EB individuals

., 1976; Lenihan et al., 1996; Murie and Boag, 1984 ). Animals with body masses below a certain threshold, as it can be the case for juveniles, are less likely to survive the winter ( Rieger, 1996 ). In our study, LB juveniles had lower fat reserves compared to EB individuals at hibernation start. Despite this fact, LB juveniles showed hibernating patterns and survival rates similar to EB individuals

. 8°C to 7°C during five to six months in winter. Hence juvenile dormice were likely oxidizing preferentially lipids over proteins during hibernation, which is in line with the limited loss of FFM ( <8% ) observed in these animals. Such decrease of FFM can likely be explained by reductions of the gastrointestinal mass and alimentary organs, as previously reported in several hibernators during long-term fasts ( Bieber et al., 2011; Carey, 1990; Hume et al., 2002 )

., 2017; Giroud et al. 2014; Stfel et al. 2017. In line with previous studies on dormice ( Stfel et al. 2017 ), our results indicate that dormice born late in the season grow faster than early-born individuals, reaching similar body sizes but lower fat content before hibernation. However, dormice born late in the season showed similar hibernation patterns and survival rates compared to early-born individuals. This suggests that tor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibern fat reserves in dormice, and being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history

The final answer is: 

This study investigated the effects of being born in the active season on growth, fattening, tor use, winter survival, and fecundity in garden dormice (Eliomys quinus). Late-born (LB) juveniles grew and fattened twice as fast as early-born (EB) individuals. Tor use was low during growth, but increased before hibernation. LB showed higher tor use, similar body size but lower fat than EB before hibern. LB showed similar hibernation patterns, but higher breeders the following year than EB. Results suggest tor is incompatible with growth, but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibern fat in dormice. Being late in the season is associated with a fast life.

    Title: The C. elegans neural editome reveals an ADAR target mRNA required for proper chemotaxis
    Abstract: ADAR proteins alter gene expression both by catalyzing adenosine ( A ) to inosine ( I ) RNA editing and binding to regulatory elements in target RNAs. Loss of ADARs affects neuronal function in all animals studied to date. Caenorhabditis elegans lacking ADARs exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the targets responsible for this phenotype remain unknown. To identify critical neural ADAR targets in C. elegans, we performed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. Development and implementation of publicly available software, SAILOR, identified 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neural editome with adr-2 associated gene expression changes, revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring clec-41 expression in adr-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.

   ., 2002 ). To date, the targets responsible for the chemosensory defects of C. elegans ADARs remain unknown. In the present study, we sought to understand the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in worms by dissecting the neural gene regulatory role of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans

. Although ADARs play critical roles in editing codons of neuronal transcripts to generate the proteomic diversity needed for proper neuronal function in mammals, our data indicate the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans adr-2 are a result of altered neural gene expression rather than recoding events

. This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene.

In this study, we have provided the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with SAILOR, we identified over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes

Previous studies have shown that worms lacking adr-2 ( - ) exhibit defects in chemotaxis ( Tonkin et al., 2002 ), yet the underlying mechanism has yet to be determined. To attempt to elucidate ADR-2 target mRNAs that are important for proper neural function, the neural editome identified above was queried for genes involved in chemotaxis or locomotion

Despite the fact that the similarity in chemotaxis phenotypes has been known for over a decade, this study is the first to identify an editing target whose expression is regulated by both C. elegans ADARs

. elegans ADARs in the nervous system is not to generate proteomic diversity, but rather to fine-tune gene expression. To further assess the role of ADR-2 in regulating the neural transcriptome, the RNA-seq datasets from three independent biological replicates of wild-type and adr-2 ( - ) neural cells were assessed for differential gene expression using DESeq ( Love et al., 2014 ) ( Supplementary file 2 )

. This data suggests restoring CLEC-41 expression within neural cells is sufficient to prevent disruptions in chemotaxis specifically associated with loss of adr-2. As ADAR family members are known to perform both editing-dependent and independent mechanisms of gene regulation, we sought to directly assess the role of A-to-I RNA editing in clec-41 mRNA expression and chemotaxis. In this regards, we queried worm strains from The Million Mutation Project ( Thompson et al

. To understand the role of ADR-2 in the neural transcriptome, RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) of poly-A+ selected RNA isolated from wild-type ( N2 ) and adr-2 ( - ) neural cells was performed. To identify and estimate A-to-I editing events from the neural transcriptome of C. elegans, we developed the SAILOR ( Software for Accurately Identifying Locations Of RNA editing ) software, a publicly available improvement in both speed and accuracy of the algorithm described in Washburn et al

., 2014; Kaletsky et al., 2016 ). By expressing a fluorescent marker in neural cells, we used this method to isolate and sequence the transcriptome of neural cells from wild-type and adr-2 deficient worms. We performed the first unbiased tissue-specific assessment of RNA editing in C. elegans. High-throughput sequencing combined with detection of A-to-I editing events using our newly developed SAILOR software revealed over 7300 editing sites in the neural editome

. In this regard, our analysis revealed 169 genes to be misregulated in adr-2 ( - ) neural cells; however, A-to-I editing was only detected in the transcripts of four of these genes. At present, it is unclear how ADR-2 is regulating expression of these genes. Several recent studies have identified editing-independent mechanisms by which mammalian ADARs promote gene expression by either promoting or inhibiting binding of other RBPs

. elegans ADARs are important for proper clec-41 expression and a previous genome-wide screen suggested clec-41 was important for proper locomotion/chemotaxis, we sought to directly assess the role of clec-41 in regulating the chemotaxis defects associated with loss of ADARs. To test this, a worm line expressing clec-41 under the control of the pan-neuronal rab-3 promoter ( rab3p ) was generated

. In sum, this study is the first of its kind in the RNA editing field to span from developing novel methodology for tissue-specific target identification to organismal behavior, significantly advancing our understanding of ADAR functions in neural cells. Our data indicates the necessity of assessing editing and gene expression at a tissue or cell-type specific level

. Identification of the edited target clec-41 as a critical regulator of chemotaxis in ADAR deficient worms would likely not have been possible without the neural-specific identification of gene expression changes as alterations in clec-41 editing and gene expression were not observed in RNA isolated from adr mutant whole worm extracts.

. Compared to RNA from wild-type neural cells, editing of clec-41 is significantly altered at 12 sites in RNA isolated from adr-1 ( - ) neural cells ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). ADR-1 regulation of editing at these adenosines was not observed in RNA isolated from L1 worms ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B )

To determine the role of ADR-2 in neural cells, the neural transcriptome of C. elegans was isolated from wild-type and adr-2 deficient worms. To accomplish this, larvae at the first stage of development ( L1 larvae ) were subjected to chemomechanical disruption followed by FACS ( Spencer et al., 2014 ). Both wild-type and adr-2 ( - ) strains express green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) driven by the pan-neural promoter, rab-3, that allows for isolation of neural cells

. Consistent with the differential expression data, loss of adr-2 resulted in a similar three-fold downregulation and the regulatory effect of either adr-1 or adr-2 cannot be observed in RNA isolated from L1 worms ( Figure 4C and D ). This suggests that both ADR-1 and ADR-2 are required for proper clec-41 expression and editing in neural cells

Similar to the mouse and fly model organisms, loss of ADARs in C. elegans results in abnormal neuronal function as evidenced by defective chemotaxis to a number of volatile chemicals sensed by the AWA and AWC neurons ( Tonkin et al., 2002 ). Loss of C. elegans ADARs likely affects the ability of the neurons to sense these chemicals as the chemotaxis defect is less severe with increasing doses of these volatiles ( Tonkin et al., 2002 )

The study investigated the role of ADAR (adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and its impact on chemotaxis. C elegans lacking ADs exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the responsible targets remained unknown. An unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the A-to editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the transcriptome revealed 736 A-to editing events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neuralome with ADR-2 gene changes revealed edited cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR deficient cells rescued the chemaxis defect, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered expression.

Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a host shutoff strategy to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomantly allow efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Using RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling, researchers explored the mechanisms utilized by IAV to induce shutoff. Results show that viral transcripts are preferentially translated, and decline in cellular synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. Measurements uncover variability in levels of cellular reduction, revealing short transcripts less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. The study advances understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggests a mechanism facilitating translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

Viral translation efficiencies fall within the range of host translation, indicating viral transcripts not preferentially translated during IAV. Co-opting of translation does not play a dominant role in gene shutoff. Analysis demonstrates host sh stems from viral dominance over mRNA. At 8 hours post-infection, viral mRNAs take 53% of the activity, while 57% of mRNAs in cells are viral. Reduction in cellular expression is the main cause of sh during infection. PA endonuc activity plays a role in sh during IAV infection.

Transcripts less affected by IAV are enriched in pathways the virus depends on, such as oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal proteins. Analysis reveals transcripts differently affected by IAV, with extent reduction related to length and GC content. Oxidative phosphorylation related transcripts less affected IAV, protein levels stable throughout infection, supporting demands essential for replication. IAVRN share features with host mRN like 5-methylguanine and polyadenyl tail, but research suggests viral mRN translated due to 5UTR features. mRNA degradation acknowledged.

Sh mechanisms provide advantages for viruses, hampering cellular response and limiting ribosomes. However, dampening gene poses challenge as viruses dependent on cellular resources. Examination of ribosome data reveals IAV non-coding reads not correlated with translation, specific virus individual transcripts. Measurements reveal sh in host synthesis driven by reduction cellular levels, mRN sensitivity not uniform, certain mRN resistant.

    Title: Feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient
    Abstract: Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. Here we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila. FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium ( ASP ) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2017; Roy et al., 2014 ). However, how local cytoneme-mediated cell-to-cell communication might create long-range signal gradients to regulate tissue morphogenesis was unknown. In this study, we aimed to address these fundamental questions by characterizing gradient formation of a Drosophila FGF family protein, Branchless ( Bnl ). In Drosophila, Bnl is the primary signal that guides the branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes ( Sutherland et al., 1996 )

. Traditionally, all paracrine signals such as FGF family proteins are thought to function as diffusible signals and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. In accordance with the same line of thinking, one hypothesis predicts that Drosophila Bnl diffuses from its source to form an extracellular gradient and that the gradient guides directional migration of the tracheal branches such as the ASP ( Horowitz and Simons, 2008; Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012 ) ( Figure 1A’ )

. Although Cut and PntP1 are intracellular transcription factors that function cell autonomously, their counteracting feedback activities, regulating where and when signal-specific cytonemes are made as a function of the levels of signal received, can self-generate gradients adopting any recipient-specific shape ( Figures 1F; 8A' )

., 1996 ). We do not understand whether and how the shape of a Bnl gradient can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies. To investigate these important gaps in knowledge, we chose to focus on the Drosophila larval ASP because of its unique features. In this system, the wing disc bnl-source is spatially separated from the recipient ASP epithelium ( Figure 1A” )

. Thus, these findings showed an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

. Given the commonality of fundamental signaling events mediated by conserved signaling proteins, feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport may offer an explanation for why signal gradients are so precise, yet adaptable and for how diverse tissue morphologies can result from just one signal transduction pathway.

. We showed that Bnl moves target-specifically from the producing cells to the ASP through cytonemes and forms a long-range concentration gradient by dynamically adopting the recipient ASP-specific shapes and contours. We also demonstrated that Bnl functions as a morphogen and, most importantly, we uncovered a novel self-regulatory mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signaling by which the Bnl morphogen gradient forms

Diverse tissue shapes and patterns are created by conserved paracrine signaling proteins such as Transforming Growth Factor β ( TGFβ ), Hedgehog ( Hh ), Wingless ( Wg/WNT ), Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) and Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ). Irrespective of the diversity of the functions and forms created, a universal mode by which these signals coordinate responses in a large population of cells involves the generation of concentration gradients

. Bnl signals exclusively to the ASP because the wing disc cells and myoblasts located between the disc and the ASP do not express its receptor, Btl. Moreover, the two additional Drosophila FGF family proteins, Pyramus and Thisbe, do not share receptors with Bnl ( Sato and Kornberg, 2002; Stathopoulos et al., 2004 )

Prior to this study, branching morphogenesis of tissues such as vertebrate lung or vasculature was proposed to be induced by exogenous, diffusible signal gradients. For instance, a mesenchymal FGF10 gradient induces branching in the vertebrate lung, and a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/VEGF gradient induces vascular sprouting ( Affolter et al., 2009; Spurlin and Nelson, 2017 )

. Several earlier reports, including biophysical analyses of vertebrate FGF8 and its distribution patterns in tissues, proposed a free or restricted diffusion-based dispersion mechanism for gradient formation ( Bökel and Brand, 2013; Toyoda et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2009 ). An alternative model proposed that the FGF8 morphogen gradient is also formed by gradual decay of fgf8 mRNA and its translation in a growing vertebrate embryo ( Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004 )

. These observations led us to address a very important question: how are the cytoneme patterns developed and maintained in the tissue? Answering this question was expected to provide the basis by which cytonemes create and regulate gradient shapes and tissue patterns. A key finding providing insight into this question came from our analysis of the spatial domains of targets of Bnl signaling in the ASP

., 2017; Sanders et al., 2013 ). However, the imaging conditions used in this study could not detect Bnl-containing source cytonemes. Future live imaging analyses are required to elucidate the mechanisms of cytoneme pathfinding. How morphogen gradients are produced in tissues is a long-standing central question. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model for the mechanism by which cytonemes can create and maintain a morphogen gradient ( Figure 8A’ )

. How might cytoneme-mediated local signaling in each ASP cell generate a long-range signal gradient across the entire ASP epithelium? One possibility is that tracheal cells, relative to their distances from the bnl-source, produce different numbers of Bnl-specific cytonemes and/or establish variable numbers of signaling contacts with the disc bnl-source

. Clonal GFP-reconstitution analyses suggested that the number of cytoneme-contacts an ASP cell makes is inversely proportional to its distance from the signal source ( Figure 5D–D” ). Since reception of Bnl is contact-dependent ( Figure 3I, I’ ), these features of patterned cytoneme formation in the recipient ASP explain how cytoneme-mediated signal reception can generate the recipient tissue-specific shapes of the gradient

. The polarized distribution pattern of Bnl:GFPex was consistent with a potential cytoneme-mediated direct transport of the molecules. Previous studies showed that ASP cells project receptor-containing cytonemes to establish direct membrane contacts with the wing disc Bnl source. These cytonemes were shown to be essential for induction of pMAPK signaling in the ASP ( Roy et al., 2014 ). However, Bnl transport through cytonemes was never visualized before

., 2013; Stanganello and Scholpp, 2016 ). Cytonemes and cytoneme-like projections are now known to be required for cell-cell communication mediated by many families of signaling proteins ( Kornberg, 2014 ). For instance, a cytoneme-dependent mechanism was shown to be essential for generating concentration-dependent signaling responses to the Hh and Dpp morphogens ( Bischoff et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017; Roy et al., 2014 )

. Moreover, the transcription factors Cut and PntP1 feedback-inhibit each other’s expression to maintain their zones of expression in response to Bnl levels ( Figure 6M–P ). The consequence is a regulatory loop that controls the generation and reinforcement of different numbers of cytonemes and levels of Bnl signaling, making the contours of the Bnl gradient robust, precisely tissue-specific, and self-sustaining

. Moreover, the formation of signal gradients is unexplored in most morphogenetic contexts, so we do not know how dispersion of the signals through extracellular space can generate the required diversity in gradient shapes and contours for a multitude of tissue architectures

. Although cut is not known to be a target of Ras/MAPK signaling, this gene was shown to be expressed in the larval spiracular branch and in the ASP ( Ohshiro et al., 2002; Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2013; Rao et al., 2015 ). The D-P axis of a third instar larval ASP consists of ~12 cells

Here is a summary of the study on the regulation of cyton-mediated transport and its role in shaping tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradients:

Researchers have long known that gradients of signaling proteins, such as FGF, play a crucial role in tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms of gradient formation have been controversial. This study aimed to address this question by characterizing the distribution of fluorescent-tagged FGF and its receptor, FGFR, expressed at physiological levels in Drosoph. F produced in the larval wing imaginal disc moves to the air sac-primord (ASP) through FG-containing cyton that extend from ASP to contact the wing disc. The number of F-receiving cyton by ASP cells decreases with distance from the source, generating a tissue-specific F gradient. Acting as a morphogen in ASP, F activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing Pointed1 at higher and Cut at lower levels. Transcriptionactors Pointed and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation FG-containing cyton, creating regions with higher-lower numbers F-receiving cyton. These results reveal a mechanism by which morphogens self-generate tissue-specific gradients through regulation of cyton-mediated dispersion.

The study found that F moves specifically from producing cells to ASP through cyton and forms a long-range gradient by adopting ASP-specific shapes and contours. It also demonstrated that F functions as a morphogen and uncovered a novel self-regulatory mechanism of cyton-mediated signaling which the F morph gradient forms diverse tissue shapes and patterns. The findings suggest that cyton-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

The study has implications for understanding how conserved signaling proteins, such as TGF, H, WNT, EGF, and F, create diverse tissue shapes and patterns through concentration gradients. The results propose a mechanism by which cyton can create and maintain morphogen gradients through feedback regulation of cyton-mediated transport.

    Title: α/β coiled coils
    Abstract: Coiled coils are the best-understood protein fold, as their backbone structure can uniquely be described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail. They do not seem a likely source of surprises, yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.

    Supporting Text:
    α-Helical coiled coils are ubiquitous protein domains, found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts ( Lupas, 1996 ). They were the first protein fold described in atomic detail ( Crick, 1953b ) and are also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations ( Crick, 1953a ), placing them at the forefront of protein design efforts ( Huang et al., 2014; Joh et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson, 2005 )

. Still missing for a complete picture of coiled-coil periodicities is the understanding of insertions of 2 and 6 residues, which should cause the greatest strain on α-helical geometry. We find that they indeed break the α-helices to form short β-strands, which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure we name the β-layer

. We think that it should be possible to reduce this structure by removing three α-helical residues and thus the single remaining backbone hydrogen bond from the parent structure. Such a minimalistic α/β coiled coil would be built of hexads, with three residues in the β and three in the α region of the Ramachandran plot

. β-Layers are found, also repetitively, in natural coiled coils, where they form regular fibers with alternating α- and β-structure, a protein fold that has not been described so far.

. Only the first β-layer is part of a 6-residue element ( hexad ) and occurs after a position g of the preceding heptad. This g position is biased towards a c position, as described above for the structures T6 and T96, yielding the same g/c position. With its alternating a- and β-layers, the α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber, based on a novel supersecondary structure element. 10. 7554/eLife. 11861. 008Figure 5. The α/β coiled coil in the Tcar0761 construct

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11861. 009 Given the structural identity between the β-layers resulting from hexads and nonads in coiled coils, and the supersecondary structures we characterized at the transition between coiled-coil segments and β-stranded domains in TAAs ( Hartmann et al., 2012 ), we searched systematically for other instances of β-layers in proteins of known structure. The results are collected in Figure 7 and Table 2

. Our results show that a novel backbone structure is accessible to the 20 proteinogenic amino acids in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with only minor mutations to a known fold.

. We find that increasing the strain further by insertions of 2x3 or 3x3 residues leads to a complete loss of helical structure and the local formation of short β-strands. These cross to form a triangular plane, which moves the path of each chain by 120° counterclockwise around the trimer axis. Within this plane, the central residues of the three β-strands form backbone hydrogen bonds whose geometry deviates substantially from that seen in β-sheets

. We have not so far detected coiled-coil proteins with β-layers in hexad spacing, nor have we been successful in constructing such a structure by fusion of MATKDD repeats between GCN4-N16V adaptors. However, as we will show in the next section, a tail-fiber protein from a Streptococcus pyogenes prophage ( 2C3F ) contains an α/β coiled coil with four β-layers, two of which are in a hexad spacing

., 2014; Woolfson, 2005 ). The structure of coiled coils is understood at a level unrivaled by any other fold. They consist of at least two α-helices, wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. In their most prevalent form they follow a heptad sequence repeat pattern. The seven positions in a heptad are labeled a – g, where positions a and d are oriented towards the core of the bundle and are thus mostly hydrophobic

. They are usually found capping one of the ends of the coiled coil, more often the N-terminal than the C-terminal one, and we have found only two further examples of coiled coils with internal β-layers: MPN010, a protein of unknown function from Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( 2BA2 ), and the aforementioned tail-fiber protein with hyaluronidase activity from the Streptococcus pyogenes prophage SF370. 1 ( 2C3F )

. Beyond the heptad repeat, a range of other periodicities is accessible to coiled coils, which is only restrained by the periodicity of the unperturbed α-helix ( Gruber and Lupas, 2003 ). This restraint is responsible for the supercoiling of the bundle: As an ideal, straight α-helix has a periodicity of about 3. 63 residues per turn, the heptad coiled coil has a left-handed twist to reduce the periodicity to 3. 5 residues per turn with respect to the bundle axis

. At the bottom, the sequence of the construct is shown together with the assigned register. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11861. 008 The α/β coiled coil of Thermosinus Tcar0761 is built of nonads and thus contains six residues per repeat in the α region of the Ramachandran plot, which retain one backbone hydrogen bond characteristic of α-helical structure

. As the requirements of a nonad on its helices would be even more extreme than those of a decad, the strategy for its accommodation is a local but complete departure from helical structure. Given the structural simplicity of β-layers, we wondered whether these could be brought about more generally by insertions of 2 residues into heptad coiled coils

. This observation was highly puzzling, since the heptad register of the protein could be assigned with great confidence, leaving no doubt that an insertion of 2 residues had occurred, but this insertion could not be explained by coiled-coil theory. For structural characterization, we therefore expressed residues 133Q-198K, covering the two insertions and the five N@d layers, fused N- and C-terminally to the trimeric form of the GCN4 leucine zipper, GCN4-pII ( Table 1 )

. We have named them β-layers and show that they can be brought about in a straightforward way by the insertion of 6 or 2 ( 9 = 2 modulo 7 ) residues into a heptad background. We propose that β-layers offer two clear advantages to protein fibers. They increase their resilience by tightly interleaving the monomers within the fiber and they offer a simple mechanism to integrate β-stranded domains into these fibers, thus increasing their functional complexity

The range of periodicities that α-helical coiled coils can assume is limited by the strain they impose on the constituent helices, as they progressively deviate from the 3. 63 residues per turn of an undistorted α-helix. Insertions of 3 residues into a heptad background ( stammers, 10/3 = 3. 33 ) lead to the largest strain observed so far in continuous coiled coils and are accommodated by the local distortion of the α-helix into a 310 helix

. Pattern searches with this motif led us to the discovery of a family of integral membrane proteins found in prokaryotes and mitochondria ( DUF1640 ), which carry this motif prominently at the beginning of their C-terminal stalk ( Figure 6 ). However, our sequence searches, both based on sequence patterns and on the discovery of relevant insertions into the heptads of coiled coils, have progressed slowly, as they require much case-by-case analysis

. Searches for structures containing β-layers were performed over the Protein Data Bank ( PDB, Dec 8 2015 ) in a two-step procedure: First, their torsion angles were scanned with seven-residue sliding windows of βββαααα and ααααβββ, where α must satisfy -70° ≤ ψ ≤ -10° and -180° ≤ φ ≤ 0°. Second, we checked for the presence of β-layers in the Ramachran plot.

    Title: Epsin deficiency impairs endocytosis by stalling the actin-dependent invagination of endocytic clathrin-coated pits
    Abstract: Epsin is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clathrin adaptor whose most critical function ( s ) in clathrin coat dynamics remain ( s ) elusive. To elucidate such function ( s ), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits.

    Supporting Text:
   . We note, however, that other endocytic proteins, including clathrin itself, have been implicated in the organization of mitotic scaffolds ( Royle, 2013; Kaur et al., 2014 ). We next analyzed the impact of the complete absence of the three epsins on clathrin-mediated endocytosis

., 2012 ). However, a recent study based on RNAi-mediated knock-down ( KD ) in fibroblastic cells reported that the KD of all the three epsins produces a global impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which was attributed to a defect of the fission reaction ( Boucrot et al., 2012 ). The goal of the present study was to provide conclusive evidence about the function ( s ) and sites of action of epsin in endocytosis using a gene KO strategy to completely eliminate all epsins

. Reported roles of epsin in clathrin-independent endocytosis may also be linked to its function in actin regulation ( Sigismund et al., 2005 ). Another important finding of our study is a weak interaction of epsin's ENTH domain with the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2. As intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with their target membranes, a coupling must exist between vesicle budding and incorporation of the proper SNARE ( s ) in the bud

., 2012 ). While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells

. As we show here, however, its most critical function is at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits. 10. 7554/eLife. 03311. 013Figure 7. Functions of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. ( A ) Schematic representation of the role of epsin in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to actin in cooperation with Hip1R ( left ). This coupling helps invaginate the pit

. A very strong link between epsin and actin is consistent with evidence for a general and evolutionarily conserved role of actin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is more prominent under conditions of high plasma membrane tensions ( Merrifield et al., 2005; Kaksonen et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2009; Boulant et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2012 )

. Several other endocytic proteins, including clathrin, are also implicated in mitosis, and, in particular, in cytokinesis ( Royle, 2013 ). In conclusion, our results reveal new aspects of the collective function of the three epsin genes and point to epsin as an important coordinator of the dynamics of endocytic clathrin coats from early to late stages. Our findings, along with previous studies suggest the models depicted in Figure 7

. The site in the NPF motif containing region likely corresponds to the actin cytoskeleton-binding ( ACB ) site, previously identified in yeast epsin ( Ent1, Skruzny et al., 2012 ). Collectively, previous findings from the literature and the findings described above are consistent with roles for epsin from early to late stage clathrin-coated pits, and more generally for an essential role of this protein in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian fibroblasts

., 2012 ). A link of epsin to actin function at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, and in particular a role as a factor that ensures a ‘controlled’ actin growth at sites of endocytosis, is supported by several observations. First, Hip1R, which had so far been considered the major link of endocytic clathrin coats to actin in mammalian cells ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001; Le Clainche et al., 2007 ), is not recruited to endocytic clathrin-coated pits in the absence of epsin

., 2012 ). In addition to roles of epsin mediated by protein–protein interactions, membrane remodeling properties resulting from the amphipathic helix at the N-terminus of its ENTH domain have been implicated in the clathrin-dependent endocytic reaction. In vitro studies showed that this helix confers, upon the ENTH domain, the property to induce bilayer curvature and even to fragment bilayer tubules into vesicles, thus pointing to a potential role of the epsin in fission ( Itoh et al

. Importantly, localization of epsin 1 at the tips of the invaginations was not affected by the absence of Hip1/Hip1R in the cytosol ( Figure 5G ), once again as in the case of intact cells. Altogether, the results discussed above support a role for epsin as a critical factor required for the temporal and spatial coordination between clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin dynamics

Previous reports have addressed the role of epsin in endocytosis. However, studies in different organisms and in cell-free systems had emphasized the different aspects of its function, so that a complete picture of its physiological role ( s ) has remained elusive. Elucidation of epsin function in mammalian cells had been complicated by the existence of the three Epn genes with overlapping functions

. Recently, it was proposed that a main role of epsin in endocytic clathrin-coated pit dynamics is to help mediate membrane fission via the membrane remodeling properties of the amphipathic helix zero of its ENTH domain ( Boucrot et al., 2012 )

. Our results, which capitalize on triple KO ( TKO ) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice, show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state. As in unicellular organisms, epsin acts in concert with Hip1R but with differences from yeast to mammals

., 2003; Xie et al., 2012 ). However, other findings pointed to a general housekeeping role of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Absence of the two epsins ( Ent1 and Ent2 ) in yeast is lethal, while hypomorphic Ent1 or Ent2 mutations result in defects in endocytosis and actin dynamics ( Wendland, 1999; Aguilar et al., 2003; Skruzny et al., 2012 ). Impairments in clathrin and actin function were also observed in epsin null Dictyostelium mutants ( Brady et al., 2008; 2010 )

. Epsin's tail also binds F-actin and co-operates with the THATCH domain of Hip1R in the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the clathrin-coated pit. In both fields Hip1R is depicted as a monomer but functions as a dimer, or heterodimer with Hip1. ( B ) Schematic representation of the multiple functions of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves a complex set of factors besides clathrin itself and the classical clathrin adaptors. These factors help coordinate nucleation of the clathrin coat with cargo selection, membrane invagination and fission ( Schmid, 1997; Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000; Kaksonen et al., 2003; Merrifield et al., 2005; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 )

. In contrast, the localization of epsin at pits was independent of Hip1R, as Hip1R KD in HeLa cells by RNAi ( Figure 4G ) did not affect epsin localization ( Figure 4H ). To address the role of epsin at the interface of endocytic clathrin coats and actin dynamics, we turned to a cell-free assay of endocyt ( Figure 5 ). In this system, eps was required for the coupling of the clath coat to the actin cytoskeleton and for invagination of endytic clrin-coated pits.

    Title: Risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren who participated in a case-control study in urban Uganda
    Abstract: Data on asthma aetiology in Africa are scarce. We investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren ( 5–17 years ) in urban Uganda. We conducted a case-control study, among 555 cases and 1115 controls. Asthma was diagnosed by study clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were tertiary education for fathers ( adjusted OR ( 95% CI ) ; 2. 32 ( 1. 71–3. 16 ) ) and mothers ( 1. 85 ( 1. 38–2. 48 ) ) ; area of residence at birth, with children born in a small town or in the city having an increased asthma risk compared to schoolchildren born in rural areas ( 2. 16 ( 1. 60–2. 92 ) ) and ( 2. 79 ( 1. 79–4. 35 ) ), respectively; father’s and mother’s history of asthma; children’s own allergic conditions; atopy; and cooking on gas/electricity. In conclusion, asthma was associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status and urbanicity. This work provides the basis for future studies to identify specific environmental/lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas in LMICs.

    The risk of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly predicted by their area of residence in early life, particularly at birth, with the highest risk among children whose early life is spent in small towns and in the city. This risk increases further in the presence of other asthma risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children’s own atopy, higher measures of socio-economic status and urbanicity

. Participants had mean age 11 years ( range 5–17 years ) ; children with asthma were slightly older, and more likely to have parents with a tertiary education and a reported history of asthma ( Table 1 ). Compared to children born in rural Uganda, children born in any town in Uganda or in the city had an increased risk of asthma [adjusted OR ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) ) 2. 16 ( 1. 60–2. 92 ) ] and [2. 79 ( 1. 79–4. 35 ) ], respectively

. Given the current rapid urbanisation in Africa and other LMICs, the prevalence of asthma is likely to increase further. This study provides the basis for future studies investigating environmental and lifestyle factors that increase asthma risk in the urban areas of LMICs.

. Even among children with no parental history of allergic disease, compared to being born in a rural area, being born in a town [2. 15 ( 1. 35–3. 44 ) ] or in the city [3. 33 ( 1. 61–6. 90 ) ] was associated with an increased risk of asthma, Table 5. Compared to the same reference group, children with a parental history of allergic disease had a higher risk of asthma that increased steadily from among children born in rural areas [2. 78 ( 1. 58–4. 89 ) ], in a town [5. 16 ( 3

., 2013; Wolff et al., 2012 ). We undertook a case-control study among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda, to investigate the main risk factors for asthma and the patterns of allergic sensitisation.

. 55 ( 1. 80–3. 61 ) ], children born in the urban area who migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in rural areas still had an increased risk of asthma [2. 11 ( 1. 14–3. 91 ) ], unlike children who were born in rural areas but migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in urban areas ( Table 4 ). We investigated the combined effects of the child’s area of residence at birth and parental history of allergic disease

. Moreover, asthma has various phenotypes which may have different aetiologies ( Lötvall et al., 2011 ). Asthma risk factors appear to vary internationally, and to differ between high-income countries ( HICs ) and low-and-middle income countries ( LMICs ) ( Douwes and Pearce, 2002 ). There is little previously published data on asthma risk factors from Africa

., 2006; Mpairwe and Amoah, 2019 ). Other risk factors for asthma in Africa and other LMICs, similar to those in HICs, include maternal smoking ( Ayuk et al., 2018; Arrais et al., 2019 ), maternal history of asthma ( Nantanda et al., 2013 ), childhood atopic sensitisation ( Addo-Yobo et al., 2001; Nyembue et al., 2012 ) and history of allergy ( Nantanda et al., 2013; Mehanna et al., 2018 )

Asthma is estimated to affect more than 235 million people globally, and is the most common non-communicable condition among children ( World Health Organisation, 2017 ). In Africa, the prevalence of asthma appears to be increasing ( Asher et al., 2006; Addo-Yobo et al., 2007; van Gemert et al., 2011; Zar et al., 2007; Lawson et al., 2017 ), particularly in urban areas ( Addo-Yobo et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2018 ), but the causes of this increase are not fully understood

. 67 ( 2. 56–8. 52 ) ], Table 6. We investigated the combined effects of parental education and urbanicity on asthma risk, by looking at the father’s education level in combination with the child’s area of residence at birth

. We found that for each level of father’s education, there was an increasing risk gradient from rural-town-city; for each area of residence, increasing father’s education level was associated with increased asthma risk; the highest risk of asthma was among children born in the city whose fathers had a tertiary education [6. 95 ( 3. 52–13. 71 ) ] ( Table 7 ). The same pattern in Table 7 was seen for mother’s education and for child’s area of residence in the first five years of life

. 78 ( 1. 58–4. 89 ) ], in a town [5. 16 ( 3. 25–8. 17 ) ] and in the city [5. 54 ( 2. 99–10. 26 ) ] ( Table 5 ). We also investigated the combined effects of area of residence at birth and children’s atopic status ( positive SPT to any of seven allergens ). Taking non-atopic children born in rural areas as the reference group, we found that non-atopic children born in town had a modest increase in asthma risk [1. 72 ( 1. 16–2

. 6% ) and controls ( 14. 4% ) [1. 03 ( 0. 67–1. 58 ) ]. There was no statistical evidence of interaction between parental education and the children’s area of residence in early life, nor interaction between age and any of the asthma risk factors. Asthma cases were more likely to report a high frequency of ‘trucks passing on the street near their home’ [2. 28 ( 1. 52–3. 43 ) ]; to come from homes that used electricity/gas for indoor cooking [1. 58 ( 1. 16–2

. 72 ( 1. 16–2. 55 ) ], which increased further among city-born children [2. 63 ( 1. 41–4. 91 ) ], Table 6. However, atopic children had a modestly increased risk of asthma even if they were born in the rural area [1. 77 ( 1. 02–3. 05 ) ], which increased substantially among atopic children born in town [4. 61 ( 3. 07–6. 90 ) ] or in the city [4. 67 ( 2. 56–8. 52 ) ], Table 6

. There were no other exclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute Research and Ethics Committee, and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. We collected data about asthma risk factors and allergic conditions identified in literature using interviewer-led questionnaires to parents and adolescents, including the ISAAC questionnaire ( Asher et al., 1995 )

. 57 ( 2. 01–3. 29 ) ] ( Table 3 ). We investigated the relative importance of area of residence at birth versus the first years of life, on the asthma risk, by looking at children who migrated between rural and urban areas during these two periods. Children born and raised in rural areas had the lowest risk ( the reference group ) ; children born and raised in urban areas had the highest risk [2. 55 ( 1. 80–3

., 2013; Mehanna et al. 2018 ). We undertook a case-control study among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda, to investigate the main factors for asthma and patterns of sensitisation.

    Title: Gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 are essential for colour pattern formation in zebrafish
    Abstract: Interactions between all three pigment cell types are required to form the stripe pattern of adult zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), but their molecular nature is poorly understood. Mutations in leopard ( leo ), encoding Connexin 41. 8 ( Cx41. 8 ), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39. 4 ( luchs ). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that luchs is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores.

   . Fish homozygous for leotK3 ( D ) or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 ( E ) show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores ( D′ and E′ ). In ( F ) a cartoon of Connexin 41. 8 is depicted showing the positions of the leo mutations. Gap junctions are composed of two hemi-channels in adjacent cells

. Each hemi-channel is made of six connexin subunits, they can be identical ( homomeric ) or different ( heteromeric ). In ( G ) a heteromeric/heterotypic gap junction is schematically shown.

. The homozygous leotK3 phenotype is considerably stronger than this, indicating that the mutant Cx41. 8 protein present in leotK3 cells has a dominant negative effect on some further component ( s ) involved in pigment pattern formation. In a simple model, this additional factor could be another connexin involved in the formation of heteromeric gap junctions together with Cx41. 8, a notion that has been suggested previously, based on the analysis of leotq270 ( Watanabe et al., 2006 )

At higher magnification ( A′ ), dark melanophores in the stripe regions and orange xanthophores in the light stripe regions are discernible. In mutants homozygous for leot1 ( B ) and heterozygous for leotK3 ( C ), the stripes are dissolved into spots. Clusters of melanophores are still visible ( B′ and C′ )

. This is surprising and indicates that the dramatic expansion of the dense iridophores that is associated with the mutant phenotypes is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores. Taken together our data suggest that Cx41. 8 and Cx39. 4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions and that these channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established

., 2006 ). The zebrafish genome contains 37 genes coding for connexins and it is impossible to deduce from the predicted amino acid sequences alone possible partners for Cx41. 8. Therefore we performed a mutagenesis of leot1 fish and screened for mutants enhancing the phenotype to a strength similar to leotK3. In this screen we identified two dominant alleles of luc; we show that luc encodes another connexin, Cx39

. The stripes in the anal and caudal fins are also affected in leo mutants, weak phenotypes show some short residual melanophore stripes, in homozygous leotK3 animals the pattern is completely lost and only few melanophores are present at the margins of the fins. The newly identified leo alleles carry mis-sense mutations in the coding sequence for Connexin 41. 8

Adult zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) display a characteristic pattern of horizontal dark and light stripes on their bodies as well as on their anal fins and tailfins ( Figure 1A ). Three types of pigment cells ( chromatophores ) are required to create this pattern

. In a genetic screen, we found two dominant alleles of a gene we named luchs ( luc ) as enhancers of the leo loss-of-function phenotype. We show that the luc gene codes for another connexin, Cx39. 4. A loss-of-function allele for luc displays a phenotype similar to leot1; however, the fins are not affected. Further we show that both genes, leo and luc, are required in the trunk in xanthophores and in melanophores, but not in iridophores. Our results suggest that Cx41. 8 and Cx39

. This suggests that the heteromeric gap junctions function in the communication between xanthophores and melanophores and potentially in the transduction of signals to the dense iridophores to induce the transition into the loose shape required for dark stripe formation.

. If gap junctions are indeed involved in the signalling events between xanthophores and iridophores, there must be ( at least ) one, so far unidentified, connexin, which is expressed in iridophores. Alternatively, other signalling pathways could be responsible for the cross-talk between iridophores and xanthophores, and gap junctions might only be required for the homotypic interactions among xanthophores

**Title:** Gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 are essential for pattern formation in zebraf

**Summary:**

In zebraf (Danio rerio), a type of fish, has a characteristic pattern of dark and light stripes on its body and fins. Three types of pigment cells (chromatophores) work together to create this pattern, but how they interact is not well understood. Mutations in the leopard gene (leo), which encodes connexin 41.8 (C41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a series of spotted patterns. A new allele, leot3, leads to a complete loss of pattern, suggesting a dominant impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified this component as C39.4 (luc). Loss-function shows it is required for stripe formation in zraf; however, fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and C39.4 are required in xanthores and melanores but not iridores, suggesting both connins form heteromeric gap junctions. Phenotypes indicate these promote homotyp interactions between melanores and xanthores, and instruct patterning of iridores.

**Key findings:**

* Homozygous for leot3 (D) or trans-hetergous for leot3 le1 (E) show identical phenotype of completely dissolved pattern.
* Individual melanores cluster together are present, mostly with iridores (D and E).
* Connexin 41.8 depicted with positions of leo mutations.
* Gap junctions composed of two hemi-channels in adjacent cells, each hemi made of six connex subunits, can be identical (homeric) or different (heteric).
* Heteromeric/heteric junction schematically shown.
* Alignment of amino sequence of zraf C41.8 with human orthologue G5 shown.
* Transmembrane shaded grey, newly identified mutations in C41.8 highlighted.
* Homozyg le3 phenotype stronger, suggesting mutant C41.8 present in le3 has dominant effect on further component involved in pattern.
* Model: additional factor could be connex involved in formation hetereric junction with C41.8, notion previously suggested by analysis leq270 (Watan et al, 2006).

**Conclusion:**

Our data suggest C41.8 and C39.4 interact to form hetereric junctions, responsible for some interactions among chromatoph while pattern established.

    Title: Evolution of insect olfactory receptors
    Abstract: The olfactory sense detects a plethora of behaviorally relevant odor molecules; gene families involved in olfaction exhibit high diversity in different animal phyla. Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory ( OR ) or ionotropic receptors ( IR ) and in some cases gustatory receptors ( GRs ). While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata ( Archaeognatha ), the firebrat Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium ( Phasmatodea ). ORs and the olfactory coreceptor ( Orco ) are with very high probability lacking in Lepismachilis; in Thermobia we have identified three Orco candidates, and in Phyllium a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs.

    Supporting Text:
   . All data on insect olfactory receptors are based on studies investigating the neopteran insects ( overview of insect order relationship is given in Figure 1 ). The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects ( Archaeognatha, Zygentoma ) and paleopteran insects ( Odonata and Ephemeroptera ) is thus completely unknown

. Our data suggests the evolution of the coreceptor Orco after the bristletails split from its last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies both on ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02115. 003 Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco ( Vosshall et al., 1999; Elmore et al

Insects provide us with an excellent opportunity to study groups of animals that have retained ancestral characteristics and understand how the specific building blocks in olfaction have evolved in both insects and other animals. Consequently, we selected insects at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile chemicals

. This species collection provides an excellent model to study the early evolution of the insect olfactory system. To address which receptors are involved in odor detection in these insects and in basal insects in general, we applied several different approaches

. In neopteran insects ( Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera, and Holometabola ) most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family ( ORs ). ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors ( Mombaerts, 1999; Robertson, 2001; Hill et al., 2002 ), displaying a distinct membrane topology ( Benton et al., 2006; Lundin et al., 2007 )

. If IRs are the only olfactory receptor type in basal insects they should exhibit a broader spectrum of possible ligands, including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, but also esters and ketones, as revealed in our physiological measurements. One additional observation in the bristletail is that many of those neurons have a broad overlap in their response spectra. One hypothesis to explain an IR-based olfactory system in L

., 1999; Elmore et al., 2003; Krieger et al., 2003; Larsson et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2008; Wicher et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, while Orco ( Vosshall and Hansson, 2011 ) is highly conserved among insects, the sequences of other olfactory receptor genes exhibit very little sequence similarity even within the same insect order ( Krieger et al., 2003 ), complicating their identification

., 2009; Croset et al., 2010 ), however, ORs and Orco have evolved during the evolution of insects and cannot be found outside the insect clade ( Peñalva-Arana et al., 2009 ). Insects with a described OR/Orco-based olfactory system were highlighted in blue, whereas species were Orco was described in this study were colored in red. All orders investigated in this study are labeled by an asterisk

., 1998; Regier et al., 2010 ), IRs are most likely the ancient type of insect olfactory receptor. But when and why did insect ORs evolve? Hexapods derived from an aquatic crustacean ancestor, probably in the Early Ordovician, approximately 483 mya ( Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013 ). The transition from sea to land meant that molecules needed to be detected in gas phase instead of aquatic solution

. Therefore, the olfactory system of a hexapod ancestor had to adapt to the terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile, air-borne chemicals. One proposed hypothesis has been that Orco and ORs of the insect type are an adaptation to this terrestrial lifestyle ( Robertson et al., 2003; Krång et al., 2012 )

. Although there is a striking evolutionary convergence towards a conserved organization of signaling pathways in vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems ( Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997 ), the involved receptor gene families evolved independently. The molecular identity of olfactory receptors was first unraveled in vertebrates ( Buck and Axel, 1991 )

. It will be part of future studies to investigate if the Orco candidates form heterodimers with other receptors like GRs or with each other to build functional receptors or if they fulfill a channel function in other processes than olfaction. Altogether our data suggests that ORs evolved in insects after the emergence of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, and therefore long after insects transitioned to a terrestrial lifestyle

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02115. 019 As none of the experiments gave a hint for the existence of any OR or Orco-related sequence in the bristletail transcriptome, we focused on the second olfactory receptor family of insects, the IRs. Although we could not identify any OR sequences in the transcriptome, a high number of putative glutamate receptor coding contigs was identified ( Table 2 )

., 2003; Krång et al., 2012 ). To reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for insect ORs, we investigated species belonging to different ancient insect orders, including Archaeognatha ( jumping bristletails ) and Zygentoma ( silverfishes and firebrats ), and a neopteran insect belonging to the Phasmatodea ( leaf and stick insects ) as so far not analyzed control group using morphological, electrophysiological and molecular techniques.

. y-signata antennal transcriptome. FISH allowed us to visualize expression of the IR co-receptors in a large number of OSNs associated with basiconic sensilla. Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of L. y-signata is not based on ORs. In insects, different sensillum types house OSNs typically responding to different sets of odors. In D

. Taken together these data suggest that leaf insects have a much broader response repertoire with a higher number of different OSN types than the more basal species we analyzed; apparently the number of olfactory receptors has increased. It also seems likely that at least the leaf insect makes use of ORs in odorant detection. We generated expansive antennal transcriptome datasets of the three insect species, employing a bioinformatics-based approach to identify Orco, ORs, GR, and IRs

., 2012 ). ORs have been suggested to be distantly related to the gustatory receptors of arthropods, with some proteins containing a signature motif in the carboxyl terminus ( Scott et al., 2001 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02115. 003Figure 1. Hexapodan phylogeny. Phylogeny was adapted from Trautwein et al. ( 2012 ). Timescale was adjusted for higher level taxa based on Rota-Stabelli et al. ( 2013 ), for Holometabola according to Wiegmann et al

., 2009 ). A second receptor family, the variant ionotropic glutamate receptors ( IRs ), is also involved in insect chemosensation ( Benton et al., 2009 ). IRs act in combinations of up to three subunits; individual odor-specific receptors and one or two of the broadly expressed coreceptors IR25a, IR8a, and IR76b ( Abuin et al., 2011 ). IRs are present in olfactory tissues across the Protostomia ( Croset et al

., 2012 ). However the small antennae and the low number of olfactory sensilla will make it even more challenging to identify putative ORs and Orco in antennal transcriptomes. ORs were first identified in neoptan insects ( Polyoptera, Parane, Holometola ) and are multitransmembrane proteins with a distinct topology ( Benton et al. 2006; Lund et al. 2007 ) IRs are the only olfactory receptor type in basal insects and should exhibit a broader spectrum of ligands including acids, aldehydes alcohols esters and ketones as revealed in physiological measurements.

    Title: Potential herd protection against Plasmodium falciparum infections conferred by mass antimalarial drug administrations
    Abstract: The global malaria burden has decreased over the last decade and many nations are attempting elimination. Asymptomatic malaria infections are not normally diagnosed or treated, posing a major hurdle for elimination efforts. One solution to this problem is mass drug administration ( MDA ), with success depending on adequate population participation. Here, we present a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar. In this study, individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2. 85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA in comparison to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.

   . If the aim for antimalarial MDA is to interrupt transmission, the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has not been examined empirically ( Cotter et al., 2013 ). Drawing from detailed micro-epidemiological and spatial data from an MDA trial in Kayin State, Myanmar ( Figure 1 ), we describe geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P. falciparum malaria in villages undergoing MDA

. falciparum malaria in villages undergoing MDA. We investigate associations between individual- and group-level participation in MDA ( potential direct and indirect effects, respectively ) ; subclinical infections; and clinical episodes of P. falciparum post-MDA. Such empirical research is important for providing an evidence base for further research, intervention, and policy work.

The primary objective of this research was to look for a potential herd effect and at the impact of non-adherence with regard to MDA for P. falciparum malaria. There was an apparent group level effect from MDA adherence, suggesting herd protection and evident from three lines of evidence. First, clinical episodes decreased among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect ( approximately 1 month ) of the administered antimalarials

The study site consisted of four villages ( KNH, TPN, HKT, and TOT ) along the Myanmar-Thailand border, in Kayin ( Karen ) State, Myanmar ( Landier et al., 2017b ). The villages were selected based on P. falciparum malaria prevalence surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR ( uPCR ) ( Imwong et al., 2015 ) and were part of a MDA pilot study ( Landier et al., 2017b )

. falciparum episode, after adjusting for individual MDA adherence and other important predictors of having a clinical episode ( Table 1 ). To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria. The increase in clinical P. falciparum episodes post-MDA also corresponded to an increase in village HBR

. While participation is obviously crucial to success, there is unlikely to be a single adherence proportion that can be applied in all situations. In this study, the elimination efforts were successful in three out of four villages even though one of those villages ( HKT ) had a similar overall adherence to the village with P. falciparum remaining after MDA ( TOT ). Likewise, this work points toward the need for considering spatial scale in MDA and in MDA adherence

., 2017a ) and clinical infections were provided the standard treatment ( see below ). A community-based malaria clinic ( referred to as a malaria post or MP ) was established in each village at the beginning of the project, as part of the malaria intervention. Village health workers were trained to diagnose malaria using rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) and to treat RDT positive infections with dose based on weight and age

. MDA should ideally be used in settings with strong public health infrastructure, including easy access to diagnosis and treatment; an up-to-date and responsive surveillance system; and effective community engagement. Used appropriately, MDA can quickly reduce or eliminate parasite reservoirs and can act as a catalyst for subregional elimination of P. falciparum malaria ( Landier et al., 2018a )

. The first clinical P. falciparum episodes during this outbreak occurred among villagers who lived in the cluster of non-MDA participation ( Figure 3 ). By M15 the clinical episodes were occurring through much of the village ( Figure 3 ). Cumulative hazards plots of clinical P. falciparum episodes in village TOT illustrate the temporal patterns in infections according to neighborhood MDA non-adherence ( aggregated into terciles ) and individual participation in MDA ( Figure 4 )

. falciparum episode ( Figure 4B ). As has been described in other settings, this individual-level finding may be related to relative perceptions of risk; with potential complacency among individuals living in areas with lower levels of malaria ( Koenker et al., 2013 ). Third, the results from the multivariable logistic regression also suggest that living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of people who did not adhere to MDA was a significant risk factor for acquiring a clinical P

. There is likely to be a context-specific critical threshold for MDA coverage, below which the reduction of the parasite reservoir is not sufficient to halt ongoing transmission. Some literature has suggested that at least 80% coverage and adherence of MDA in the targeted population is necessary in order for the MDA to be successful ( World Health Organization, 2015b )

Mass drug administration ( MDA ) is the provision of medications to entire target populations and the approach has been used for many infectious diseases, including lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminths, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and trachoma ( Keenan et al., 2013 ). MDA has historically been used for P. falciparum malaria ( Poirot et al., 2013 ) and has recently been trialed in several locations in Africa ( Gitaka et al., 2017; Mwesigwa et al

., 2017; Landier et al., 2018a ). Given that drug pressure ( through provision of antimalarial drugs ) provides a survival advantage for resistant parasites, there has been some hesitance in using MDA for malaria. One historical malaria eradication campaign relied on the inclusion of sub-therapeutic levels of antimalarials distributed in table salt across large populations ( Pinotti et al., 1955 )

. Second, neighborhoods with high MDA adherence never experienced the same levels of infection as those with mid or low MDA adherence ( Figure 4A ). Individuals who participated in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with low adherence had the highest risk of having a clinical episode whereas those who did not participate in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with high adherence had the lowest risk of having a clinical P. falciparum episode ( Figure 4B )

. falciparum malaria ( Landier et al., 2018a ). While antimalarials are usually administered following diagnosis ( confirmed or presumed ) or used as a prophylactic, MDA is used because of an intended population- or community-level effect. The rationale is that the transmission potential or reproductive rate of malaria is so high that a sufficient amount of the parasite reservoir needs to be removed in order to disrupt transmission

. This group level protective effect from MDA was also evident in the rainy season following MDA ( Figure 3 ) which corresponded to a surge in vector activity ( Appendix 1—figure 3 ). Once the P. falciparum outbreak began ( M12 ), there was a lag of approximately 1 month between the onset of clinical episodes in neighborhoods with mid and low MDA adherence and then occurred in neighborhoods with high MDA adherence ( Figure 4A )

., 1955 ). This program likely led to the emergence of parasite resistance in the same regions ( Wootton et al., 2002 ) and this has in part led to hesitance among some institutions ( i. e. the World Health Organization and ministries of health ) to implement MDA for malaria ( World Health Organization, 2015a )

. MDA consisted of 3 days of DHA + P, with a single low dose of primaquine on the third day, repeated over three months ( M0, M1, M2 for the first group and M9, M10, M11 for the control group ). Follow-up blood surveys were conducted in each village every third month after M0 until M18. A final full blood survey was completed in each village at M24. Mosquitoes were collected monthly using human landing catches to estimate the human biting rate ( HBR )

. 4. 4% of all individuals in low MDA non-adherence neighborhoods had at least one clinical P. falciparum episode by the end of the study period, in comparison to 7. 6% in mid and 9. 6% in high MDA non-adherence neighborhoods ( log-rank test p-value=0. 0485; Figure 4A ). The increase in clinical P. falcum episodes in low M non-adherence neighborhoods corresponded to an increase in HBR ( Figure 3 ) and proportion of individuals with asymptomatic P. falcum ( Figure 5 )

    Title: Conservation of transcription factor binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution
    Abstract: Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors ( TFs ). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.

    Supporting Text:
   . A striking level of conservation of TF binding specificity was observed, with fruit flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans. Conservation of specificity extended to secondary modes of binding, and even subtle dinucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift

., 2010; Jolma et al., 2013 ). These, more subtle DNA binding preferences could potentially change faster than and independently of the canonical core DNA recognition motif, and could thus also allow TF specificity to slowly drift in evolution. To characterize the role of divergence and subtle drift in TF DNA binding specificity in animal diversity, we used HT-SELEX to determine TF binding specificities in Drosophila melanogaster

. Dendrograms in A and D show amino-acid sequence similarity of the DNA-binding domains. ( F ) Summary of biological roles of TFs with divergent specificities. Cell types and biological functions are indicated in green in Drosophila ( left ) and human ( right ). For some TFs with multiple functions ( e. g., bZIP and HOX proteins, nuclear receptors ), only one divergent role is shown for clarity

. Thus, in addition to extending the repertoire of Drosophila TF binding specificities by providing 122 novel high-resolution motifs, our dataset extends previous models by shedding light on new features of Drosophila TF DNA-binding characteristics. TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites ( e. g., Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Jolma et al

. Drosophila has many genes that are orthologous to human TF genes with highly conserved DBD protein sequences even though these species diverged over 600 million years ago ( Figure 4; Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). We show here that orthologous TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding ( Figure 5 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2–13 )

We report here high-resolution DNA-binding specificity for a large fraction of Drosophila TFs. The binding models were determined using HT-SELEX, the same method we have used previously to determine specificities of mammalian TFs. Consistent with our earlier data, we found that TFs and TF DBDs recognize the same, relatively long sites, with more than half of all models being >10 bp in length ( Jolma et al., 2013 )

. A global comparison between fruit fly and mammalian TF binding specificities also revealed that fruit fly DNA-binding specificities cover almost the complete range of mammalian TF specificities ( Figure 4 ), and that clustering of motifs is not influenced by the species indicating that orthologous proteins recognize highly conserved motifs. These results indicate that the gene regulatory code that determines how DNA sequence directs gene expression is highly conserved in evolution. 10

. This result is surprising even considering the similarity of protein sequences between DBD ortholog pairs, and also in marked contrast to the reported low degree of conservation of protein–protein interactions between species ( Gandhi et al., 2006 ). Despite significant number of differences in the number of TFs, most binding specificities present in mammals were also identified in Drosophila, suggesting that the gene regulatory code is highly conserved

. TFs are generally highly conserved in evolution. However, sequence analysis of DBD sequences of Drosophila and human revealed substantial differences in conservation of orthologous TF DBD pairs both between and within different TF families ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), suggesting that some divergence of TF binding specificity could have occurred

. For this, we used existing full-length collection of Drosophila TF cDNAs ( Hens et al., 2011 ), and also generated a novel genome-scale collection of fruit fly TF DNA binding domain ( DBD ) constructs. The TFs were expressed in E. coli and their specificity determined using HT-SELEX ( Jolma et al., 2010, 2013 ), and compared to our existing human and mouse HT-SELEX data

Note that similar secondary modes exist for all factors. ( B ) Heatmap showing interdependency between bases in the binding model of the Runt family TF lz

. To address the conservation of the binding specificities, we first calculated motif similarity score of all previously existing B1H and HT-SELEX binding profiles for Drosophila and mammals, respectively, and illustrated their similarities as a network map ( Figure 3 )

. Taken together, our results indicate that human and fruit fly TF binding specificities display a striking level of conservation, despite dramatic morphological differences resulting from more than 600 million years of evolution and lack of detectable sequence conservation at the level of cis-regulatory elements. These results indicate that analogously to the genetic code, which is more conserved than protein-coding DNA ( Moura et al

. Note also the red rectangles off the diagonal, indicating that although the homeodomain proteins binding to different motifs have high sequence similarity, the motifs themselves are divergent. See Figure 2—source data 1 for details. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04837. 020 Several previous studies have analyzed TF DNA binding specificities in Drosophila using methods different to those used here

., 2013 ) was conserved in fruit flies, with nearly identical sites bound by both SPDEF and Ets98B. The conservation of the secondary binding mode despite divergence of the primary specificity indicates that the binding modes can in some cases evolve independently of each other. Protein sequence-level conservation of the DNA-binding domains of the ETS proteins suggests that the divergence in specificity occurred at or near the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates ( not shown )

., 2013 ), these methods have not been previously used to systematically analyze specificities of many TF families from more distantly related organisms. Conversely, a large collection of Drosophila TF binding specificities has been generated using bacterial one-hybrid assay ( B1H; Noyes et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011; Enuameh et al., 2013 ). However, this method has not been applied to mammalian TFs at a scale sufficient for a broad comparison of TF specificity

. This fact suggests that DNA binding specificity is highly constrained by protein structure and is difficult to alter even over long evolutionary time scales. These results also indicate that TF specificity is not generally subject to subtle drift, but tends to either stay very similar or evolve to a distinctly different state

. Within each TF family, DNA binding specificity has also diverged considerably, with many families having 2–10 different subclasses displaying different primary binding specificities ( Berger et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010; Jolma et al., 2013 ). In addition, many differences in the TF repertoire between invertebrates and vertebrates exist due to the expansion of some gene families, such as nuclear receptors and C2H2 zinc finger factors in vertebrates ( Charoensawan et al., 2010 )

. Previously, Wolfe and colleagues have reported a dataset of Drosophila TF motifs ( Noyes et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011; Enuameh et al., 2013 ). Much of these data are obtained using B1H analysis. Our data generally show good agreement with these data at the level of consensus and/or core TF binding sequences. However, the flanking sequences recognized by many TFs ( Jolma et al

Our results indicate that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Dophila and mammals, and for ortholog TFs the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide preferences.

    Title: Recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary co-development using simultaneous multilineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells
    Abstract: The extensive crosstalk between the developing heart and lung is critical to their proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, there remains a lack of models that investigate the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues ( μTs ), and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . In 3D suspension culture, each cardio-pulmonary μT effectively segregates into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation. This study therefore delivers an effective in vitro model for studying the mechanistic interplay between the developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis. The extensive cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during organogenesis has been well documented in the mouse model ( Peng et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al

. Finally, following the withdrawal of WNT agonist, each concentric cardio-pulmonary μT reorganized and ultimately segregated into cardiac-only and pulmonary-only μTs. This work therefore offers an effective hiPSC-based model for investigating cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue segregation during human embryogenesis.

. 5+ ) and lung ( NKX2. 1+ ) progenitors, respectively, using the same sets of small molecule cocktails modulating WNT, nodal and TGF-β signaling in a temporal specific manner. Using 3D suspension culture with continuing WNT activation, we engineered pulmonary-centered, cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues ( μTs ), and demonstrated the accompanying cardiac lineage as an essential cellular niche that promoted effective alveolar maturation

. We demonstrated that upon co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm, a series of shared signaling events were capable of driving simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. Upon transitioning the co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors to 3D suspension culture, we observed expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, which was supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage

. Further morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages, as well as their crosstalk during this process will require future in-depth investigation. In addition, our work offers a novel model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation

Here, we described a novel strategy to model human cardio-pulmonary co-development using multi-lineage hiPSC differentiation. The current study primarily focused on co-induction of cardio-pulmonary progenitor cells, thus establishing the foundation for future investigations of how the crosstalk between these two organ lineages regulates their respective lineage maturation

. This observation is consistent with the recently reported inter-dependence between cardiac and pulmonary lineages during embryogenesis ( Steimle, 2018 ). In the absence of cardiac lineage, NKX2. 1+ lung progenitors could not achieve as effective AT2 maturation as what is observed in cardio-pulmonary μTs. This is again emphasizing that chemical cues derived from heart field also plays a role in lung development ( Peng et al., 2013; Steimle, 2018 )

., 2009 ). This inter-lineage crosstalk is partly mediated by the multipotent mesodermal progenitors located between the developing heart and lung, which have the potential for lineage contribution to pulmonary endothelium, pulmonary smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes ( Peng et al., 2013 ). However, the extent of translation of findings derived from rodent models to the understanding of developmental interplay between human cardio-pulmonary systems remains unclear

Human embryogenesis is a highly orchestrated process that requires delicate coordination between organs that originate from different germ layers. As the two main organs within the chest cavity, the mesoderm-derived heart and endoderm-derived lung partake in have extensive mutual interaction that are essential for their proper morphogenesis ( Peng et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Arora et al., 2012; Steimle, 2018 )

., 2016; Tseng et al., 2006 ). Heart begins to form around gestation week 3, which is the earliest organ to be developed during embryogenesis ( Buckingham et al., 2005; Tan and Lewandowski, 2020 ). Lung development initiates soon afterwards during weeks 4–7 ( Schittny, 2017 ). In the present study, we showed that the progenitor cells of both heart and lung can be simultaneously induced following 15 days of co-differentiation from hiPSCs

., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Steimle, 2018 ) ; however, the translatability of these findings to human embryogenesis remains elusive due to the lack of proper model systems. Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation has offered an effective means for recapitulating and investigating human organogenesis, and tremendous progress has been made toward directed cardiac or pulmonary specification ( Lian et al., 2012; Mummery et al., 2012; Burridge et al., 2014; Lian et al

. The ability to enable effective alveolar induction from hiPSC-derived lung progenitors with the convenient of suspension culture also opens the door to large-scale production of alveolar cells, a critical challenge in regenerative medicine applications. Using dual-lineage cardio-pulmonary μTs formed from the co-induced progenitors, we observed a novel process of cardio-pulmonary tissue segregation

. There is, therefore, a critical need for experimentally tractable systems for investigating human cardio-pulmonary co-development during organogenesis. Much work has been done for directed differentiation of hiPSCs into either cardiomyocytes ( Lian et al., 2012; Mummery et al., 2012; Burridge et al., 2014; Lian et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Kattman et al., 2011 ), or pulmonary epithelium ( Chen et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2017; Dye et al

., 2015; de Carvalho et al., 2019 ). Here, we established an effective approach that enabled AT2 cell maturation within 3 days in suspension culture of 3D cell aggregates spontaneously formed from Day-15 cardiac and pulmonary progenitors. We further demonstrated that the presence of accompanying cardiac lineage is critical for robust alveolar induction

. More comprehensive time-series analysis will be necessary to further delineate the fine temporal relationship between heart and lung lineage specification, which is expected to provide fundamental insights regarding cardio-pulmonary crosstalk during their paralleled organogenesis. In conclusion, our work focuses on specification of cardio-pulmonary progenitors that have the potential to further mature into their respective descendent lineages

. Here, we showed that by fine tuning WNT signaling using a small-molecule inhibitor of GSK-3β ( CHIR ), robust induction of endoderm and subsequently lung progenitors can be achieved without any exogenous growth factors. This is consistent with the observation that CHIR was capable of inducing cardiac differentiation in replacement of combined effect of exogenous Activin A and BMP4 ( Lian et al., 2012 ). In addition, Martyn et al

. Our finding suggests shared signaling requirement for lung and heart induction from their respective germ-layer progenitors, which is consistent with their close spatial coordinates within the embryonic body planning ( Lufkin et al., 1991; Makki and Capecchi, 2012; Chisaka and Capecchi, 1991 ). In both mouse and human pluripotent stem cell differentiation models, exogenous BMP4 has been shown to be crucial for ventralization of the foregut endoderm to give rise to NKX2

. Comparison of existing protocols for single-lineage cardiac and pulmonary differentiation from hiPSCs indicates shared regulators despite their distinct germ-layer origin. Firstly, both endodermal and mesodermal specification is facilitated by the inhibition of insulin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling ( Lian et al., 2012; Lian et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2012 ), and can be induced by a similar set of paracrine factors, including WNT, BMP, and TGF-β ( Kattman et al

. In this study, we described a stepwise, growth-factor-free protocol for simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary progenitors from a single culture of pluripotent stem cells. Our results indicate that WNT and nodal signaling play a critical role in the specification of both lineages from their respective germ-layer progenitors, which is consistent with previous findings in mouse models ( Peng et al. 2013; Hoff et al. 2009; Stele 2018 ). We further demonstrated that cardiac accompaniment is essential for effective alve maturation of pulmonary progenitors in 3D suspension culture, which is consistent with the role of cardiac lineage in lung development ( Peng et al 2013; Stele 2018 )
Researchers have demonstrated an unexpected flexibility in the mutation rate of Escherichia coli as a response to changes in selective pressure under lethal stress. Contrary to the belief that mutation rate is a slowly-evolving parameter, they found that hypermutation evolves when cells adapt to high ethanol stress. Hypermut states are transitory and rates decrease once cells are adapted to the environment. Cellular mortality was identified as the major driving force behind the quick evolution of mutation rates. This study sheds light on the dynamics of mutation evolution and explains the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy.

A collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates was used to identify optimal rates for rapid growth under ethanol. Experimental evolution revealed an essential role for hypermutation in de novo adaptation to high stress. Measuring mutation at different points during evolution showed a dynamic rate that increases in response to enhanced pressure and decreases once cells are adapted. Results suggest an essential role for hypermutation under lethal stress. A long-term experiment adapting E coli to high ethanol showed that hypermutants yield benefits depending on their rates. A collection of mutants with a range of mutation was grown in 5% EtOH to verify this hypothesis. Mutations are necessary to adapt new environments, but changes in DNA are rarely beneficial, often neutral, or deleterious.

A decrease in mutation rate coincides with a decrease in death constant and fraction of cells. Data suggest mortality is the cost of hypermutation when adaptation to certain EtOH is achieved. Strains with lower rates from compensatory mutations increase fitness due to decreased rates. Lowered mutational load in harsh environments may consist of cells with various rates, tolerating hypermut. This offers an explanation for increased rate in tolerant lines. Mutants with lower rates are advantageous under conditions than those with higher rates. In absence of ethanol, no differences were observed among wild and mutants. Crucial for hyper for rapid growth under-le stress supplying population with beneficial mutations.

The actual rate of a population is prone to change by evolution. Knowledge on long dynamics of hypermutation and mechanisms remains fragment. Conditions for spread of mutators and increased rate reversal are unexplored. Hypermutation under stress is not limited to proary, observed in S cerevis during ethanol, Plmod falcum, and Candida glabr. Using evolution, emergence of hyper during adaptation near-le ethanol was observed. Mutators sporadically occur in mild stress, but highly tolerant lines acquired hyperphenotype. Alterations in rate, irrespective of system, confer competitive under-le stress. Advantage of hyper can be attributed second-order, following effects of mutations. Relative fitness from competition between wild and mutants was determined. Trade between adaptability and adaptedness is responsible for low rates, decrease by energy to maintain fidelity.

    Title: SnRK1-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization mediates the low-energy response in plants
    Abstract: Metabolic adjustment to changing environmental conditions, particularly balancing of growth and defense responses, is crucial for all organisms to survive. The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in the low-energy response in animals, yeast and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here we identified the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites.

    Supporting Text:
   . Moreover, we found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10, which was proposed to be a central regulator of transcription in starvation response ( Baena-González and Sheen, 2008 ), is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. Therefore, bZIP63 presents the first TF acting as direct target of SnRK1 in the transcriptional energy deprivation response

. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function was further underlined by complementation of the bzip63 mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. Wt, but not a S29/S294/S300A mutant of bZIP63, could complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes. Likewise, also the strong delay in extended night-triggered induction of ASN1, DIN10, and ProDH in bzip63 plants was complemented with wt bZIP63, but not the ( triple ) S/A mutant

. Here we show that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner. In an unbiased approach, we identified SnRK1 as one of the kinases responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation and found that it targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63

. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05828. 026 To verify that SnRK1 plays an important role in the in the in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63 we compared the phosphorylation state of bZIP63 in plants overexpressing bZIP63-GFP or -YFP in the wt and akin10 background, respectively

. Moreover, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta and propose a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.

. We found that bZIP63 is highly phosphorylated in Arabidopsis. By applying different proteolytic digests we were able to identify seven in vivo phosphorylated serine residues, distributed all over the protein. While exogenous sucrose decreased the global phosphorylation level of bZIP63, extended night treatment further increased its phosphorylation, thus supporting the idea that bZIP63 plays a role in energy signaling

. SnRK1 is involved in the regulation of plant metabolism, development, and stress response ( Polge and Thomas, 2007; Baena-González and Sheen, 2008 ), Snf1 is required for the switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism in the absence of glucose ( Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008 ), and AMPK regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and feeding behavior in animals ( Hardie et al., 2012 )

. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, transient overexpression of AKIN10, a catalytic subunit of the SnRK1 complex, resulted in a transcriptional profile reminiscent of various starvation conditions and led to the identification of 1021 putative SnRK1 target genes ( Baena-González et al., 2007 ). However, the transcription factors mediating the transcriptional response of SnRK1 to energy starvation are still unknown. Based on reporter gene activation assays in protoplasts ( Baena-González et al

. The SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 ( SnRK1 ) in plants and its orthologs, the sucrose-non-fermenting 1 ( Snf1 ) kinase in yeast and the AMP-dependent protein kinase ( AMPK ) in mammals, are well-known and crucial master regulators of energy homeostasis

Here we show that bZIP63 plays an important role in the energy starvation response and metabolic regulation. This is in accordance with the sugar/energy-dependent expression of bZIP63 ( Matiolli et al., 2011; Kunz et al., 2014 ), as well as with the fact that several of its proposed target genes are involved in the low-energy response and metabolism ( Matiolli et al., 2011; Veerabagu et al., 2014 )

. As the origin of SnRK1 dates back even further, to the common ancestor of plants and animals ( Bayer et al., 2014 ), it is likely that phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 poses an ancient and important regulatory mechanism. We therefore set out to test the functional relevance of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63

. As SnRK1 was previously reported to enhance the activity of several C/S1 group bZIPs ( Baena-González et al., 2007 ) and was suggested to be activated under energy starvation conditions ( Baena-González and Sheen, 2008 ) —which could explain the observed hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63 in extended night—we focused our further analysis on AKIN10 and AKIN11. 10. 7554/eLife. 05828. 015Figure 4. Several different kinases can phosphorylate bZIP63

., 2007; Guo et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010 ) showed compelling evidence for phosphorylation-dependent changes in bZIP dimerization in animals. Still, even in these cases it is often not entirely clear whether bZIP phosphorylation affects dimerization directly or indirectly by enhancing DNA binding. bZIP63 is a member of the C-group of Arabidopsis bZIPs, which was proposed to play a role in energy metabolism, seed maturation, and germination under osmotic stress ( Jakoby et al

. This ultimately results in the induction of a different set of target genes and thereby mediates the transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. However, it is clear that in the plant additional factors like bZIP expression, stability and interaction with other components add more complexity to the situation. Surprisingly, to date only a small number of papers have reported an influence of phosphorylation on bZIP dimerization ( Kim et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2010; Lee et al

. To determine the impact of bZIP63 phosphorylation in planta, we transformed the bzip63 mutant with genomic constructs of bZIP63 containing either the wt sequence ( GY lines ), or a S/A mutation of S29, S294, and S300, respectively ( GAY lines ) with a C-terminal YFP tag ( Figure 7A; Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C )

. Together, these experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation of bZIP63 at the AKIN10 target sites is essential for the function of bZIP63 in the plant. Our findings show that bZIP63 phosphorylation, at residues distant from the central bZIP domain, strongly regulates its activity

., 2013 ). Notably, only three of the seven sites—S29, S294, and S300—were found by tryptic protein digest, underpinning the advantage of alternative proteolytic digests for phospho-peptide identification in targeted proteomics. To identify potential upstream kinases of bZIP63, we performed in-gel kinase assays with plant protein extracts from roots of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis plants or root cell culture using recombinantly expressed bZIP63 as substrate

. In fact, phosphorylation was even lower here than in the light. These data indicate that bZIP63 has a basal level of phosphorylation in the plant and undergoes changes in response to environmental conditions.

    Title: Ring finger protein 10 is a novel synaptonuclear messenger encoding activation of NMDA receptors in hippocampus
    Abstract: Synapses and nuclei are connected by bidirectional communication mechanisms that enable information transfer encoded by macromolecules. Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors ( NMDARs ). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation ( LTP ) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines.

   . RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and we provide compelling evidence for the importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. The intracellular C-terminal domain of GluN2A contains several target sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules ( Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016 ). Among others, RNF10 and CaM share the same GluN2A binding region ( aa 991–1029; Bajaj et al

. In this context, RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines as observed after specific synaptic stimuli and required for postsynaptic modifications needed to convey LTP induction.

. This result strongly indicates that an impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling and not a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing. The present and other studies indicate that NMDAR complex is likely a very rich source of protein messengers that are capable of trafficking to the nucleus

. The protein messenger Jacob, following long-distance transport and nuclear import, can encode and transduce the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals to the nucleus and might dock a NMDA-receptor-derived signalosome to nuclear target sites in a stimulus-dependent manner ( Karpova et al., 2013 ). Notably, here we show that activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to an increase in RNF10 nuclear localization

This report describes a novel synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway that specifically links activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs to nuclear gene expression. We demonstrate that RNF10 is highly expressed in the nucleus as well as at synapses, where it is part of the NMDAR complex and directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs

. Taken together these findings indicate that enhancing synaptic activity of di-heteromeric GluN2A-containing NMDARs results in the dissociation of RNF10 from the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2A at postsynaptic sites and a tighter association with neuronal importin and importin-dependent nuclear translocation, followed by an association of RNF10 with the transcription factor Meox2

. This emphasizes that the synaptodendritic but not the somatic pool of RNF10 largely contributes to its nuclear transport upon LTP-inducing stimuli. Thus, RNF10 accumulates in the nucleus following long-distance protein transport. 10. 7554/eLife. 12430. 010Figure 8. LTP induction triggers RNF10 translocation to the nucleus. ( A–C ) RNF10-tdEOS translocates from distal dendrites to the nucleus in mature hippocampal neurons upon high-frequency 18s@50Hz field synaptic stimulation

., 2014 ). Our results indicate a preferential formation of RNF10/GluN2A complex in resting conditions that is disrupted in favor of CaM/GluN2A complex following synaptic activity-dependent calcium influx. Overall, our data show that RNF10 binding to GluN2A plays a key role for RNF10 anchoring at the excitatory synapse but also interfere with the formation of CaM/NMDAR complex

., 2008 ), encodes and transduces the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B-containing NMDAR signals to the nucleus and elicits the divergent transcriptional responses after activation of these receptors ( Dieterich et al., 2008; Karpova et al., 2013 ). These findings point to the fascinating possibility that specific NMDAR signals are encoded at synaptic sites and decoded in the nucleus by long-distance trafficking of protein messengers

. However, we also describe that RNF10 can interact with the majority of importin α isoforms including the importin α5 previously described to be associated with the NMDAR complex ( Jeffrey et al., 2009 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptonuclear trafficking of RNF10 is involved in the control of gene expression, which is necessary for LTP-type synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons

. Moreover, the presence of RNF10 in close proximity to the receptor channel allows for a rapid calcium-dependent dissociation of RNF10/GluN2A complex following NMDAR activation and for the subsequent formation of RNF10/importin complex. Here, we show that interaction of RNF10 with importin α1 represents a key step for its nuclear translocation

. Here, we identified Ring Finger protein 10 ( RNF10; Seki et al., 2000 ) as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger, localized at the PSD and specifically associated to the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2A but not GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. After stimulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs, RNF10 binds to importin α1 for nuclear long-distance transport

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12430. 007 The synaptic and nuclear localization in neurons, the presence of two different NLS motifs and its interaction with GluN2A and Meox2 ( Lin et al., 2005 ) suggest that RNF10 could be a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. To validate this hypothesis, we assessed whether the modulation of neuronal activity affects the subcellular localization of RNF10 and its association with the interacting proteins

. Notably, the effect of RNF10 silencing on dendritic spine density was fully rescued by co-expressing a wild-type human variant of RNF10 resistant to shRNA ( see Materials and methods; flag-RNF10; Figure 4A–E ). Interestingly, overexpression of RNF10 per se had no effect on dendritic spine morphology ( data not shown ). We then verified whether the loss of spines following RNF10 protein knock-down was correlated with an altered expression of the main components of the excitatory synapse

. Notably, we show that long-term potentiation ( LTP ) induces nuclear translocation of RNF10, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the modulation of gene expression. Most interestingly, RNF10-regulated gene expression appears to feed back to synaptic function.

We next asked whether RNF10 translocation from dendritic spines to the nucleus produced a modulation of the protein level of Meox2/RNF10 target genes. First, we analyzed the expression of p21WAF1/cip1, a known Meox2 target gene ( Lin et al., 2005; Malik et al., 2013 )

. 10. 7554/eLife. 12430. 008Figure 6. Activation of synaptic NMDARs triggers RNF10 translocation to the nucleus.

On the other hand, two different protocols known to activate extrasynaptic NMDARs ( Hardingham et al., 2002; Karpova et al., 2013 ) failed to induce the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic spines to the nucleus ( Figure 6, right panels ).

    Title: Structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1
    Abstract: Swi2/Snf2 ATPases remodel substrates such as nucleosomes and transcription complexes to control a wide range of DNA-associated processes, but detailed structural information on the ATP-dependent remodeling reactions is largely absent. The single subunit remodeler Mot1 ( modifier of transcription 1 ) dissociates TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) :DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.

    Supporting Text:
    Swi2/Snf2-type ATPases remodel protein:DNA complexes to regulate the structure and epigenetic state of chromatin regions during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Mot1, apart from being an essential gene regulator, serves as an attractive model system for structural and mechanistic studies of Swi2/Snf2 enzymes

. Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption. Although the interface between Mot1 and NC2 that we observe in the crystal structure of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is arguably very small, the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix H5 from TBP and H4 from DNA

. Here, we provide a pseudoatomic structure of the Swi2/Snf2 enzyme Mot1 bound to its protein:DNA substrate and a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex

., 2001 ). We crystallized E. cuniculi Mot1NTD in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3. 8 Å resolution along with biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex. Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.

. ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force, but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target. Indeed, we find that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism

. However, we were not able to detect any significant changes in the Mot1-catalyzed TBP:DNA dissociation rate or the ATP hydrolysis rate of this process in the presence of NC2 ( Figure 3 ). Taken together, these data show that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is a bona fide substrate of Mot1's remodeling activity. Moreover, in contrast to the TBP:DNA substrates, the ATPase domain is necessary to disrupt the NC2-containing complexes. 10. 7554/eLife. 07432. 005Figure 2

. To facilitate this analysis, we formed the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex on long TATA box-containing DNA ( at least 26 base pairs upstream from the TATA box ) and used ADP·BeFX, ATPγS, and ADP to lock the ATPase domain in ATP- and ADP-bound states ( Ponomarev et al., 1995 )

. The formation of the Mot1NTD:NC2 clamp ensures robust dependence on ATP hydrolysis, which triggers the final dissociation step, and which most probably occurs by very short-range translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain along the minor groove. Considering the relative orientation of Mot1CTD and DNA in our model as well as the 3′–5′ tracking direction shown for other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes ( Whitehouse et al., 2003; Zofall et al

., 2012 ). Notably, most of the cross-links between the Mot1CTD and NC2HF map to the protrusion region of the RecA2-like subdomain, the major family-specific insertion region of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases ( Flaus et al., 2006 ). A general role for the Swi2/Snf2 protrusions in distorting local DNA structure has been proposed ( Hauk and Bowman, 2011 )

. However, we found that the Mot1:TBP:DNA complex is much more stable in the presence of negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ), another global transcriptional regulator, whose occurrence coincides with Mot1 and TBP at many genomic locations ( Andrau et al., 2002; Dasgupta et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2008; Van Werven et al., 2008; Spedale et al., 2012 ). NC2 is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits, which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively ( Kamada et al., 2001 )

. Therefore, previous analyses have revealed not only how Mot1 binds TBP, but also that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone. Numerous biochemical and more recent structural studies of the Mot1:TBP complex predicted the approximate positioning of the ATPase domain ( Mot1CTD ) with respect to the DNA upstream of the TATA box ( Auble and Hahn, 1993; Auble et al., 1994; Darst et al., 2001; Gumbs et al., 2003; Sprouse et al., 2006; Wollmann et al., 2011; Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012 )

., 2006; Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012 ). Additionally, it is known that the nucleotide state of Swi2/Snf2 domains modulates their conformation and affinity for DNA ( Lewis et al., 2008; Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012 ). Therefore, in order to define the location of the Swi2/Snf2 domain in the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, we analyzed the full-length complex by chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry ( CX-MS ) as well as by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM, see below )

. In both cases, the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domains ( purple ) specifically recognize their histone fold:DNA substrates. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07432. 022 In summary, we provide here a first structural framework for the interaction of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with its protein:DNA substrate

., 2008; de Graaf et al., 2010 ). While Mot1 forms a stable complex with DNA-bound TBP and NC2, it is fully capable of disrupting this complex in the presence of ATP. Thus, our data suggest that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is not only a bona fide but perhaps even preferential substrate for Mot1. It is possible that NC2 marks the TBP-containing complexes for Mot1-catalyzed disassembly, e. g

. Our structural analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP:DNA:NC2 by Mot1 that could be relevant for other remodelers that act on histone fold protein substrates. It seems plausible to reason that in the first step, TBP's and NC2's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot1 binding in an ATP-independent manner. ATP binding does not result in the disassembly of the complex

. Left side: the binding of Mot1NTD ( yellow ) induces destabilization of TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions ( TBP is shown in blue, NC2 is represented by a green shape ). Right side: an ISWI-type Swi2/Snf2 remodeler bound to nucleosome according to current models ( Dang and Bartholomew, 2007; Yamada et al., 2011; Hota et al., 2013 ). The DNA-binding domain ( yellow ) engages extranucleosomal DNA at the entry site

. The observed changes indicate reduced strength of the TBP–DNA and DNA–NC2 interactions as well as stabilization of Mot1–NC contacts. The MotNTD: TBP:DNA:NC complex is more stable than the TBP:DNA:NC complex in the presence of NC2, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC dissociation in an ATP-independent manner.

    Title: Ternatin and improved synthetic variants kill cancer cells by targeting the elongation factor-1A ternary complex
    Abstract: Cyclic peptide natural products have evolved to exploit diverse protein targets, many of which control essential cellular processes. Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures, we designed synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.

    Supporting Text:
   . Compound 3 differs from ternatin only at position 6, whereas 4 additionally has dehydro-homoleucine at position 4. Here, we demonstrate that ternatin and its structural variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. We further identify the elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides

. Ternatins inhibit protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation, and photo-ternatin 5 identified eEF1A as a plausible target. Surprisingly, photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA. To our knowledge, specific binding of a small molecule to the eEF1A ternary complex has not been reported previously

In this study, we sought to identify the target of the cytotoxic natural product, ternatin, previously characterized as a potent adipogenesis inhibitor. Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic activity of the cyclic heptapeptide natural product A3, we designed compounds 3 and 4, which are up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin

. Whether this binding event blocks translation elongation by a mechanism analogous to the antibiotic kirromycin, as suggested by the genetic dominance of ternatin sensitivity, is an exciting question that awaits future biochemical and structural studies. Also unexpected was our discovery that two structurally unrelated natural products, didemnin and ansatrienin, compete with 5 for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex

. Of the four structurally divergent natural products now identified as eEF1A inhibitors, ternatins may be particularly attractive as leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts, due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis.

. The apparent structural similarity to ternatin was not mentioned in the patent application. 10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 003Figure 1.

( b ) Effect of cyclic peptides 1–4 ( three-fold dilutions ) on HCT116 cell proliferation over 72 hr. ( c ) Compounds 1 and 4 were tested against a panel of 21 cancer cell lines

. Ternatin ( 1, Figure 1a ) is an N-methylated cyclic heptapeptide that inhibits adipogenesis at low nanomolar concentrations ( EC50 20 nM ) and becomes cytotoxic at ten-fold higher concentrations ( Shimokawa et al., 2008a ). Previous work established an important role for leucine-4, as substitution with alanine ( ternatin-4-Ala, 2 ) abolished biological activity ( Shimokawa et al., 2008b )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 005 Based on the potential similarity between A3 and ternatin structures, we hypothesized that replacement of N-Me-Ala-6 and Leu-4 in ternatin with two A3-specific residues – pipecolic acid and dehydro-homoleucine, respectively – would be sufficient to confer increased cytotoxic potency. These considerations led to the design of cyclic peptides 3 and 4 as potential ‘north/south’ hybrids of ternatin and A3 ( Figure 1a )

., 2010 ). All five compounds were reported to be cytotoxic to cancer cells in the picomolar to low nanomolar range ( IC50 0. 1–24 nM vs HCT116, MCF7, and P388 cells ). One of the more potent congeners, termed ‘A3’, is shown in Figure 1a. Although only 4 out of 11 stereocenters in A3 were assigned, we were able to map the amino acid sequence, stereochemistry, and N-methylation pattern directly onto the structure of ternatin

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 015 Ternatin ( 1 ) and ternatin-4-Ala ( 2 ) were synthesized as described, and all spectral data were in accordance with those reported ( Shimokawa et al., 2008b ). Cyclic peptides 3, 4, 4b, and 5, were synthesized by the same route as ternatin ( Figure 8 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 016Figure 8. Synthesis of ternatin variants

., 2008b ). Motivating the current study, ternatin's molecular target and mechanism of action were completely unknown. While searching for cyclic peptides that, like ternatin, incorporate a β-hydroxy leucine, we found a patent application that describes partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an Aspergillus fungus in Malaysia ( Blunt et al., 2010 )

. Combined with the recent finding that nannocystin A targets domain III of eEF1A ( Krastel et al., 2015 ), our study suggests that four natural products with highly diverse chemical structures have evolved independently to target a shared interaction surface near Ala399 on eEF1A. A didemnin variant, plitidepsin, is currently in advanced clinical trials for multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma ( PharmaMar Pipeline ). Hence, drugging this surface on eEF1A may have clinical utility

. In addition to serving as drugs and potential leads for cancer and immune diseases, these cyclic peptides have proven to be useful as chemical probes, revealing new cellular roles for their target proteins, as well as mechanistic insights into the biochemical processes they orchestrate

. This family of N-methylated cyclic heptapeptides represents a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors.

Examples of cyclic peptides with well characterized cellular targets include cyclosporin ( Liu et al., 1991 ), trapoxin and romidepsin ( Taunton et al., 1996; Nakajima et al., 1998 ), and cotransin/CAM741 and decatransin ( Besemer et al., 2005; Garrison et al., 2005; Junne et al., 2015 )

., 2008; Villar et al., 2014 ). Cyclic peptide natural products, especially those containing one or more N-methyl ( or N-alkyl ) amino acids, comprise a privileged class of macrocycles due to their modular structure, relative ease of synthesis, intrinsic cell permeability, and constrained three-dimensional architectures ( Bockus et al., 2013; Giordanetto and Kihlberg, 2014; Hewitt et al., 2015 )

Macrocyclic natural products are a rich source of biologically active compounds, and identification of their targets can open up new opportunities for therapeutic intervention ( Driggers et al., 2008; Villar et al., 2014 )

., 2005; Junne et al., 2015 ). These macrocyclic compounds target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling ( cyclophilin/calcineurin ), epigenetic regulation ( histone deacetylases ), and secretory protein biogenesis ( Sec61 translocon ), respectively

.,2015 ) The elongation factor-1 ternary complex ( e1·G·TP·aminoacy-tRNA ) is central to protein biosynthesis, with e1 catalyzing peptide bond formation between aminoacylated tRNA and the growing polypeptide chain. The ternary complex is composed of e1, GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA, and the elongation factor G (EF-GTPase ), which hydrolyzes GTP and releases e1 from the ternary complex upon completion of peptide bond formation

The elongation factor-1 ternary complex e1·G·TP·amacyl-tRNA is a target of the cytotoxic natural product ternatin, as well as its synthetic variants 3 and 4, which are up 500-fold more potent than ternatin. Mutations in domain III of e1 prevent tern binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for e1 modulation. We conclude that eukotic elongation factor-1 and its ternary with G and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.

    Title: A role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating revealed by studies of Lowe syndrome cells
    Abstract: Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. Although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.

   . In addition, it revealed that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. Prompted by these findings, we examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. We found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat

. ( D ) Model depicting the impact of the lack of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patients on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Absence of the 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL delays endocytosis by stalling late-stage pits, impairs uncoating and triggers the nucleation of comets from clathrin vesicles that retain PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 and fail to uncoat.

. Such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells ( Suchy and Nussbaum, 2002; Allen, 2003; Hayes et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2010; Dambournet et al., 2011; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis

., 2009; Posor et al., 2013 ), strongly suggesting that lack of OCRL affects the completion of the endocytic reaction. Thus far, defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis have not been reported in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts, and therefore we next analyzed clathrin-coated pit dynamics in patient and control cells by time-lapse microscopy

. The presence in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts of numerous actin comets driven by clathrin-positive vesicles adds further support to a close relationship between endocytic clathrin coats and actin, a topic of intense debate, although most recent studies support such a link at least for a major subset of clathrin-dependent endocytic events ( Fujimoto et al., 2000; Merrifield et al., 2002, 2005; Boucrot et al., 2006; Kaksonen et al., 2006; Tsujita et al., 2006; Ferguson et al

., 2004; Choudhury et al., 2005; Hyvola et al., 2006; Swan et al., 2010; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). Additional roles for OCRL in clathrin-independent forms of endocytosis ( micropinocytosis and phagocytosis ) had also been reported ( Bohdanowicz et al., 2012; Kuhbacher et al., 2012; Marion et al., 2012 ). Our present results demonstrate that the absence of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patient cells results in an impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis

. These results suggest that the loss of OCRL impairs uncoating, a finding consistent with its very late recruitment at pits. Its absence also delays late steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, possibly as a result of sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles. Such findings prompted us to assess the potential occurrence in patient cells of a defect in the internalization of transferrin, a well established cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis

Enzymes containing a 5-phosphatase domain have been implicated at multiple stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, from clathrin coat nucleation to uncoating ( Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012 ). While OCRL, which directly interacts with clathrin, had been detected at late stage clathrin-coated pits ( Erdmann et al., 2007; Mao et al

., 2011 ), there is no evidence to date that the absence of OCRL, or defects in OCRL function, impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The initial goal of this study was to gain new insights into the function of OCRL through a global analysis of the OCRL interactome. Such an analysis corroborated evidence for a primary role of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits as it confirmed clathrin and other endocytic adaptors as OCRL binding partners

. In addition, biotin labeling of the endogenous surface pool of the transferrin receptor showed its accumulation at the plasma membrane in patient cells compared to controls ( Figure 4L ). From these results, we conclude OCRL is required for normal dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A reported phenotype of Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts is an abnormal organization of actin, with the presence of numerous actin comets ( Suchy and Nussbaum, 2002; Allen, 2003; Hayes et al

. To investigate this possibility, we examined endocytic clathrin-coated pits and their dynamics in patient cells that lack OCRL. Dermal fibroblasts derived from a Lowe syndrome patient and from a control subject were used for these studies. Patient cells lack OCRL, as indeed confirmed by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3A, B ) and western blotting ( Figure 3C ). Accordingly, a near 1

. This was evidenced by the expression of an SNX9-binding mutant construct of OCRL ( GFP-OCRLP3 ) that still localized to clathrin-coated pits in patient cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2D ). Given the interactions of OCRL with several prominent endocytic factors such as clathrin and AP-2, it is highly likely that multiple binding partners regulate its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits

. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.

. Additionally, clathrin-coated pits showed a clustered distribution. Exogenous overexpression of GFP-OCRLWT rescued this phenotype ( Figure 3K–K′ ), while expression of a catalytically inactive OCRL ( GFP-OCRLD523G ) failed to do so ( Figure 3L–L′ ). Such phenotypes were reminiscent of the accumulation of puncta positive for endocytic clathrin coat components observed in cells where the progression of late stage clathrin-coated pits to free vesicles is impaired ( Ferguson et al

. In the absence of OCRL, as in Lowe syndrome, the accumulation of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-rich vesicles that fail to lose their clathrin coat leads to an endocytic defect resulting from the sequestration of endocytic factors on these vesicles ( Figure 7D ).

., 2011 ). Rather, they suggest that defects in endocytosis and in the fate of newly formed endocytic vesicles ultimately contribute to abnormal cargo sorting, as exemplified by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the tip of actin comets. Impairments in endocytosis may also contribute to the cognitive deficiencies observed in Lowe syndrome patients

    Title: FAK/PYK2 promotes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and intestinal tumorigenesis by phosphorylating GSK3β
    Abstract: Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an unequivocal role in colorectal cancer, but identification of effective Wnt inhibitors for use in cancer remains a tremendous challenge. New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in APCmin/+ mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216 to reinforce pathway output—β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3β/β-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . The intestinal level of p-GSK3βY216 was also much higher in APCmin/+ mice than in control mice, whereas PF-562271 treatment greatly suppressed GSK3βY216 phosphorylation and GSK3β ubiquitination. Overall, these results strongly support that FAK/PYK2 kinase contributes to APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis through phosphorylating GSK3βY216 to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling

The current study has revealed a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory circuit in intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings indicate that: loss of functional APC induces the expression of FAK and PYK2, elevated FAK/PYK2 phosphorylates GSK3βY216 to stabilize β-catenin, which initiates and supports intestinal tumorigenesis ( Figure 6E ). Phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was discovered about two decades ago ( Hughes et al

. But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To determine whether FAK is involved in APC-driven tumorigenesis through its catalytic activity, we examined the anti-tumorigenic effects of dual FAK/PYK2 kinase inhibitor PF-562271 in APCmin/+ mice, a genetic model predisposed to the formation of intestinal adenomas due to aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling

., 2006 ). The current study clearly show that by phosphorylating GSK3α/βY279/Y216, FAK and PYK2 function redundantly in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells, raising the possibility that FAK and PYK2 could also function redundantly in Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. However, if so, why was intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone sufficient to cause complete abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mutant mice ( Ashton et al

., 1998 ). The loss of functional APC results in less efficient GSK3 ( two isoforms in mammals, GSK3α and GSK3β ) -mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to reduced degradation of β-catenin, thus mimicking Wnt stimulation. Although APC mutation is believed to activate Wnt signaling constitutively, histopathological studies show that only about 50% colon carcinoma cells display homogeneous nuclear β-catenin staining ( Chung et al

. Nevertheless, regardless of the exact mechanisms mediating in vivo PYK2 regulation during intestinal tumorigenesis, elevated PYK2 in tumors further enhances Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis through phosphorylating GSK3 to promote the Wnt pathway—a positive feedback loop that reinforces the tumor development process. Tumors undergoing targeted therapy often relapse due to the utilization of autonomous parallel-redundant signaling

., 2013 ). If FAK/PYk2 regulates Wnt/β-catenin through their kinase activity by phosphorylating GSK3βY216, there should be differences in the time courses of FAK/PYK2 inhibitor-mediated suppression of FAK/PYK2 kinase activity, GSK3βY216 phosphorylation and β-catenin. The results confirmed that treatment with PF-562271 caused sequential inhibition of PYK2 kinase activity represented as phosphorylated PYK2Y402 ( Park et al., 2004 ), GSK3βY216 phosphorylation and β-catenin ( Figure 4A )

. If this is also true in GSK3β's case, what is the involved phosphorylation site ( s )? What are the kinases responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation? Is this phosphorylation involved in intestinal tumorigenesis? Our results indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 by FAK and PYK2 is a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP, and is required for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and crucial for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

. Most colorectal carcinomas develop from adenomas via adenoma-carcinoma-sequence driven by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic mutations ( Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990 ) ; Our results ( Figure 5 ) imply that FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulation axis is an early participant and driving force for intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice

. We found that the IHC staining intensities of FAK, PYK2, GSK3β, p-GSK3α/βY279/Y216 and β-catenin were increased during the course of the normal-adenoma–carcinoma progression ( Figure 6A ), demonstrating that induction of FAK/PYK2 expression, GSK3α/βY279/Y216 phosphorylation and β-catenin accumulation did occur at the early stage ( the adenoma stage ) of colon cancer development

. However, in DLD-1 cells expressing FAK and PYK2, simultaneous KD of both kinases were required to inhibit GSK3Y279/Y216 phosphorylation and to reduce the level of β-catenin ( Figure 3F ), strongly suggesting that FAK and PYK2 function redundantly to phosphorylate GSK3Y279/Y216 to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To further confirm that GSK3 is a phosphorylation substrate of FAK/PYK2, we examined whether FAK/PYK2 binds to GSK3β and FAK/PYK2's ability to phosphorylate GSK3βY216 in vitro

., 1993 ), but until now, its role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling remains mysterious. Our results has uncovered a previously unrealized role of GSK3βY216 phosphorylation: it triggers GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP and subsequent GSK3β monoubiquitination by β-TrCP, an event required for Wnt-induced inhibition of β-catenin degradation, thus identifying phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 as an ‘activator’ of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway

. The current study indicates that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 per se does not affect GSK3β activity towards β-catenin, thus ruling out the possibility that GSK3βY216 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through modulating GSK3β kinase activity. GSK3 is emerging as a prominent drug target for the treatment of various disorders including cancer and currently more than 50 GSK3 kinase inhibitors have been developed ( McCubrey et al., 2014 )

. The current study indicates that both FAK and PYK2 are elevated in already established colon tumors in CRC patients and that effective inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells expressing FAK and PYK2 will only be achieved by simultaneously targeting both kinases; we believe these results provide a solid mechanistic justification for clinical use of FAK/PYK2 dual inhibitor instead of FAK-specific inhibitor for better clinical outcomes in CRC patients.

Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt ( Wnt/β-catenin ) pathway is crucial for many cancer types, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract: genetic alterations in Wnt signaling occur in 93% of human CRCs, among which inactivation of tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) ( 85% ) and activating mutations of proto-oncogene β-catenin ( 5% ) ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 ) are mutually exclusive ( Sparks et al., 1998 )

. Together, these data indicated that GSK3αY279 and GSK3βY216 function redundantly in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and in CRC cells. To identify the kinases responsible for GSK3βY216 phosphorylation, we performed a pilot screening experiment using various kinase inhibitors. We found that PF-562271 inhibited GSKβ216 phosphorylation and β-caten in DLD-1 cells expressing FAK and PY2 ( Figure 4 ), indicating that FAK PY2 is a GSKβ kinase.

    Title: Down regulation of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to enable transition between motor states
    Abstract: The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli ( EVS ). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.

    Supporting Text:
   . Specifically, we examined the contribution of vestibular sensory signals to the control of balance during transition between quiet standing and locomotion as well as between two standing postures. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space, and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion ( Angelaki and Cullen, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2012 ). Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture

In order to transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted. Indeed, prior to the transitions tested, the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset ( vertical red line, Figures 2, 4 and 6 )

. Importantly, the suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states. Thus, our results demonstrate that humans ‘stop balancing’ before they start moving and ‘stop moving’ before they start balancing again.

. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. During quiet standing, whole-body accelerations ( and related GRF ) and oscillations within the limits of the base of support are small. An adaptive feedback controller ( Fitzpatrick et al

., 2013; Forbes et al., 2017 ). The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. A similar approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control ( Luu et al., 2012 )

., 2012 ). Here, the continuity of the vestibular influence on postural control during transitions was assessed to determine whether a discrete change in balance correcting mechanisms accompanies transitions between two motor states. We hypothesized that a discrete suspension in the vestibular control of balance would occur prior to the transition, due to the disengagement of the current control policy prior to the implementation of the next control policy, as predicted under OFC theory.

. To identify state-dependent changes in vestibular control of balance over the locomotor transition period, the magnitude of the peak time-dependent coherence and its corresponding frequency were extracted from the movement-time normalized data in each subject and for the three phases of the balance-locomotor transitions: quiet standing ( from first vibration pulse to transition onset for initiation and from end of transition to last vibration pulse for termination ), transition ( from

. Because we used two separate computers to save the forceplate and inertial measurement units’ data, the two were synchronized in post-processing using the onset of the first vibration pulse. After identifying the biomechanical markers of the transitions phases, we analyzed the vestibular responses during the transition between standing balance and locomotion and between the two standing postures to determine if vestibular feedback is disrupted as predicted by the OFC theory

., 1973 ), suggesting that balance correcting responses are down regulated 100 to 300 ms before the step-related modulation in muscle activity. These results partly confirm and extend previous work that reported a decrease in vestibular influence at locomotion initiation but increased vestibular influence at locomotor termination ( Bent et al., 2002 )

. The disruption in vestibular contribution to balance during transitions appears to contradict a key prediction from referent control theory: a monotonic shift in referent body orientation during shifts in postures while standing upright ( Mullick et al., 2018 ). Our data show the intermittent use of vestibular feedback during transition between standing postures but it is unclear if a shift in referent body configuration is associated with such a transition

. 81 ± 0. 04 m, weight 80. 5 ± 9. 6 kg ( mean ± SD ) ] performed the experiment involving locomotion initiation and termination ( locomotor transition ) and three males and three females [age 27. 5 ± 2. 1 years old, height 1. 74 ± 0. 07 m, weight 69. 9 ± 6. 3 kg] performed the experiment involving a change in body-weight distribution ( posture-to-posture transition ). During trials, subjects were exposed to electrical vestibular stimulation ( EVS ) ( Dakin et al

. The stimulus bandwidth ( 0–20 Hz ) was chosen to characterize the entire frequency response of vestibular-induced modulation in lower limb muscle and whole-body force production ( Dakin et al., 2007, 2010, 2011; Mian et al., 2010; Reynolds, 2010 ). The stimulus amplitude varied between ±4 mA, and was chosen to evoke measurable force responses during both standing and walking and ensure subject comfort, based on previous experience ( Dakin et al., 2007, 2013; Blouin et al

. Furthermore, this vestibular disengagement solves the classic problem formulated by von Holst and Mittelstaedt regarding the opposing action from stabilizing reflexes when initiating motion ( von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950 ). From a biomechanical point of view, the disengagement of vestibular influence on the whole-body postural responses may also be necessary for the transition process, and thus incorporated into motor planning

. This influence depends on the muscles’ active engagement in balance control, and the alignment of the muscles’ mechanical action with both the plane of instability and the direction of the vestibular disturbance ( Lund and Broberg, 1983; Britton et al., 1993; Fitzpatrick et al., 1994; Luu et al., 2012; Mian and Day, 2014; Forbes et al., 2016 ). Contextually-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during both quiet standing ( Lund and Broberg, 1983; Fitzpatrick et al

. The disruption in the vestibular control of balance observed prior to biomechanical transition indicates that the brain first down regulates balance-correcting mechanisms to enable the transition. This disruption in the vestibular control of balance reduces counteracting effects of vestibular balance correcting responses that could prohibit movement initiation, thus supporting a prediction from current OFC models

. Our results appear to mirror this behavior and extend the framework to a balance-locomotor context. In the brainstem, selective attenuation of ‘vestibular only’ neurons might change the response of vestibular nuclei neurons during self-generated locomotor movement ( Roy and Cullen, 2001 )

. This latter theory suggests that a transition between postures involves a monotonic shift in the referent body orientation ( Feldman et al., 2011; Mullick et al., 2018 ), transforming posture-stabilizing mechanisms into movement-inducing ones. To determine whether transition between motor states is comprised of discrete events or is a continuous process, we examined the temporal dynamics of sensory feedback gains prior to and during the transition between two motor states

. 113 ± 0. 070 m/s, t ( 51 ) = 73. 82, p<0. 001 ), respectively in the head forward and head left conditions. In the posture-to-posture experiment, we did not find any significant behavioral differences between the trials with and without EVS. To quantify the effect of the vestibular stimulus on subjects' behaviour, we recorded the ground reaction forces ( GRF ) applied to their body as well as linear acceleration and angular velocity of their head over the duration of each trial

. Based on our results, it appears that the transition in gains between the initial and the final policies is preceded by a suppression of vestibular gain. Vestibular gain is increased once again following the transition, but in a context-dependent manner. For example, in the event of a transition from quiet standing to locomotion, vestibular gain is increased during locomotion to control lateral stability, primarily ( Figure 2 )

. For the posture-to-posture transition, the motor control policy associated with standing balance is disengaged to permit the shift to a new posture. These periods of null coherence preceding transition thus illustrate when the brain disengages the current control policy

Our results show that the vestibular control of balance is suspended during transitions between standing and locomotion as well as between postures, suggesting a discrete change in motor control policies as predicted by OF theory. The suspension of vestibular influence on whole-body responses during transitions is not specific to one type of transition, indicating a general process that occurs during transitions between balance and other motor states. Our results demonstrate that humans stop balancing before they start and stop moving before they balance again. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses is related to different sensory gains needed to control whole movements by quiet and locomotor control policies.

    Title: Switching of metabolic programs in response to light availability is an essential function of the cyanobacterial circadian output pathway
    Abstract: The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect, and demonstrate that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. Our observations highlight how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations.

    Supporting Text:
   . We find that both accumulation and utilization of the carbon reserves required for energy production during periods of darkness are defective in the rpaA- strain, and that correction of these defects restores viability. Our results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.

. Our results strongly suggest that functional circadian output mediated by the activity of RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day, as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk. These metabolic adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy production and sustain cell viability during periods of darkness that challenge and constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth. 10. 7554/eLife. 23210. 014Figure 5

. Exposure to darkness restricts energy availability, creating unique metabolic demands in cyanobacteria which depend on sunlight for energy production through photosynthesis. Strikingly, the rpaA- strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic, but not in constant light environments ( Takai et al., 2006 ), suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light/dark cycles

. Here we show that the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk ( Figure 5E ) – this leads to alterations in cellular energy charge and, as previously observed, to a severe reduction in fitness

. However, since the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase involved in glycogen degradation is low in the rpaA- strain, we find this scenario less likely. Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system. The output of the core oscillator, through regulation of RpaA activity, temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness

., 2016 ). Our findings are consistent with this model and provide novel mechanistic insight into circadian regulation of cyanobacterial energy metabolism. It remains to be investigated whether the circadian-driven preparation for darkness is a shared strategy employed by other photosynthetic organisms. Further, our results suggest a molecular explanation for the observed selective advantage of circadian resonance

. It will be interesting to analyze how deletion of rpaA affects the ability of cells to respond to other environmental challenges that cyanobacteria routinely face. Finally, our data together with a recent study by Diamond and colleagues ( Diamond et al., 2015 ) emphasize the role of the circadian output pathway in driving oscillations in metabolism

., 2009; Diamond et al., 2015 ). To investigate the role of RpaA in orchestrating diurnal transcription of metabolic genes, we performed RNA sequencing in the rpaA- ‘clock rescue’ strain and an isogenic rpaA+ strain after exposure to darkness. The expression of circadian dusk-peaking genes was most affected in the rpaA deletion strain exposed to darkness ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A )

. The circadian clock schedules periods of activity of RpaA to coordinate anticipatory carbon reserve formation during the day with carbon utilizing metabolic pathways activated at dusk to fuel cell integrity and viability in an environment in which light and dark periods alternate. Defects present in the rpaA deficient cells, indicated by red symbols on the diagram, lead to a low energy charge and reduced viability during periods of darkness. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife

. Circadian clocks and their output synchronize the metabolic activity of cells with diurnal fluctuations ( Tu and McKnight, 2006; Green et al., 2008; Graf et al., 2010; Dodd et al., 2015 ). To understand if the observed viability defect stems from an inability of the rpaA- strain ( which is arrested in a ‘dawn-like’ transcriptional state [Markson et al

. We found that while the control cRpaA strain grows under these conditions despite lower levels of RpaA driven by the constitutive promoter, the cRpaA D53A strain is inviable ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E ). We conclude that the active DNA-binding form of RpaA is necessary and sufficient for cell viability during exposure to light/dark conditions. We next analyzed the role of the core KaiABC clock in sustaining viability of cyanobacterial cells in light/dark conditions

. Though we show that RpaA activity is crucial for regulation of key aspects of carbohydrate metabolism, we identify ~90 genes whose expression is abrogated at dusk and throughout darkness in the rpaA- strain and it is possible that additional physiological processes are defective in the absence of rpaA

. Correct scheduling of central carbon metabolic activities allows cells to survive the night. Recently, Lambert et al. observed that the circadian clock orchestrates a trade-off between rapid cell growth in the morning and robustness to starvation in the afternoon, suggesting preparation for the night as a plausible role for the circadian clock ( Lambert et al., 2016 )

. Relative RNA levels were measured in the light/dark conditions by RNA sequencing. ( B ) A diagram representing carbon metabolism in S. elongatus PCC7942 in the dark. At night glycogen constitutes the store for energy and carbon skeletons. Glycogen degradation, glycolysis and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways are the key metabolic pathways operating at night

. Based on our findings, we expect that the fitness defects in the strains with core oscillator periods unequal to the period of environmental variation result from mistiming of RpaA activation. The resultant mistiming of accumulation and mobilization of glycogen stores with the onset of the nightfall would lead to a carbon deficit at night, and impact growth as in the rpaA- mutant during dark periods

. Moreover, although our results indicate that the KaiABC clock is the main regulator of diurnal RpaA phosphorylation, other factors may influence the activity of RpaA or its regulon under fluctuating environmental conditions. RpaA is known to cooperate with RpaB ( Espinosa et al., 2015 ), a transcription factor crucial for responses to high light conditions

. We conclude that the deficiency in the preparation of a reserve carbon source – which occurs not at the level of transcription of the glycogen synthesis genes or regulation of the activity of the encoded enzymes – may contribute to the impaired viability of the rpaA- strain in the dark. 10. 7554/eLife. 23210. 012Figure 4. The rpaA- strain accumulates little glycogen. ( A ) A diagram representing carbon metabolism in S. elongatus PCC7942 in light. During the day S

. Therefore, the rpaA- strain appears to be unable to activate the carbon catabolic pathways upon the onset of darkness because it cannot induce transcription of the requisite enzymes at dusk. 10. 7554/eLife. 23210. 009Figure 3. Sugar catabolism pathways are abrogated in the rpaA- strain.

We observed that these genes are expressed at a high level, further emphasizing the role of phosphorylated RpaA in activation of the dusk transcriptional program and maintenance of cell viability in light/dark conditions

., 2013 ). While it is clear that the circadian transcriptional program schedules timing of gene expression when the clock is free-running in the absence of changes in external light, it is unclear how circadian control of gene expression is used under more physiologically relevant conditions when light and dark periods alternate

The authors found that RPA is necessary for anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day and metabolic switching to catabolism at dusk. The rA strain cannot accumulate glycogen during the day and is unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk. Reconstruction of carbon pathways with an external carbon source restores viability in the rA strain. The study highlights the circadian pathway's role in coordinating carbon metabolism to maximize fitness under periodic energy limitations. The circadian output through RPA regulates carbon anabolism and catabism and cell viability in lightark conditions. The phosphorylated form of RPA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for coordination of carbon metabolism. Deletion of RPA prevents glycogen accumulation and renders cells unable to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to energy alterations and reduced fitness. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase involved in glyc degradation is low in the rA strain. The data support a model where anticipation of dark-induced resource limitation is an essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system. The circadian output through RPA temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for metabolic demands of darkness. The study provides mechanistic insight into circadian regulation of cyanobacterial metabolism and suggests the circadian preparation for darkness is a strategy employed by photosynthetic organisms.

    Title: Structure and ion-release mechanism of PIB-4-type ATPases
    Abstract: Transition metals, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients in all organisms, but also highly toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy-metal transporting P-type ( PIB ) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. No structural information is available for the PIB-4-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest cargo scope, and hence even their topology remains elusive. Here, we present structures and complementary functional analyses of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. The data disclose the architecture, devoid of classical so-called heavy-metal-binding domains ( HMBDs ), and provide fundamentally new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. We reveal several novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. We also establish that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. Combined with new inhibitory compounds, our results open up for efforts in for example drug discovery, since PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.

   . However, the metal specificity of the PIB-4-ATPases remains elusive as some members have a confirmed cobalt specificity, while others seemingly have broader or altered ion transport profiles, also transporting ions such as Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu+, and even Ca2+ ( Zielazinski et al., 2012; Raimunda et al., 2012; Moreno et al., 2008; Scherer and Nies, 2009; Seigneurin-Berny et al., 2006 )

The ability to adapt to environmental changes in heavy-metal levels is paramount for all cells, as these elements are essential for a range of cellular processes and yet toxic at elevated concentrations ( Waldron et al., 2009; Kozlowski et al., 2009 ). Transition metal transporting P-type ( PIB ) ATPase proteins are critical for cellular heavy-metal homeostasis, providing efflux of for example copper, zinc, and cobalt from the intracellular milieu

. PIB-ATPases are subdivided into groups based on conserved sequence motifs and the selectivity towards transported transition metal ions ( Smith et al., 2014; Argüello, 2003; Zielazinski et al., 2012; Zhitnitsky and Lewinson, 2014 ). Whereas Cu+- and Zn2+-transporting PIB-1 and PIB-2 ATPases are relatively well characterized, little is known regarding the PIB-4 proteins, which comprise some of the simplest and shortest proteins within the entire P-type ATPase superfamily ( Smith et al

We employed the established PIB-4 model sCoaT ( UniProt ID A3T2G5 ) to shed further light on the structure and mechanism of the entire PIB-4-class. As the metal ion specificity of the PIB-4-ATPases is known to be wide, the ATPase activity was assessed in vitro in lipid–detergent solution using the so-called Baginski assay, in the presence of a range of different heavy metals

. Nevertheless, the substances outlined here represent promising leads for drug-discovery efforts or to aid the development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants to prevent accumulation or for enrichment. Collectively, the first structure of a PIB-4-type ATPase reveals the topology of PIB-4-ATPases, displaying an eight helix M-domain configuration, and likely no HMBDs, at least in members without extended N-termini

. We note that there are PIB-4-ATPases with extended N-termini that, in contrast to sCoaT, may harbour HMBDs ( Smith et al., 2014 ). Conversely, the sCoaT N-terminus is rich in metal-binding methionine, cysteine, histidine, aspartate, and glutamate residues, and this feature is conserved among PIB-4-ATPases ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). We therefore explored the role of this N-terminal tail through assessment of an sCoaT form lacking the first 33 residues

., 2006 ). Thus, the PIB-4-ATPases appear to have the widest scope of transported ions of the PIB-ATPases, and it is possible that further subclassification principles and sequence motifs will be identified. Due to the broad ion transport range, they have been proposed to serve as multifunctional emergency pumps that can be exploited under extreme environmental stress to maintain heavy-metal homeostasis ( Smith et al., 2017 )

., 2017 ). Hitherto, the available high-resolution structural information of full-length PIB-ATPases is limited to two structures each of ion-free conformations of the Cu+-transporting PIB-1-ATPase from Legionella pneumophila ( LpCopA ) ( Gourdon et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014 ), and the Zn2+-transporting PIB-2-ATPase from Shigella sonnei ( SsZntA ) ( Wang et al., 2014 )

., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014; González-Guerrero and Argüello, 2008; Morin et al., 2009 ). As there are no known zinc/cadmium chaperones for PIB-4-ATPases, and because classical HMBDs appear to be missing in at least some proteins of the group, the MB’ function may need to be revisited. Alternatively, the N-terminus may have merely been maintained through evolution without conferring functional benefits or disadvantages

., 2014; Andersson et al., 2014 ). The high-affinity-binding site in PIB-4-ATPases has previously been suggested to be formed by residues from the conserved SPC- ( starting from S325 ) and HEGxT- ( from H657 ) motifs of M4 and M6, based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy and mutagenesis studies ( Zielazinski et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2016 )

. The topology of PIB-4-ATPases has been a conundrum as sequence analyses have proposed different arrangements, with variable number of transmembrane segments and different sizes of the N-termini ( Smith et al., 2014; Gourdon et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Argüello, 2012; Drees et al., 2015; Andersson et al., 2014 ). However, our data unambiguously demonstrate that PIB-4-ATPases possess eight transmembrane helices, MA and MB followed by M1–M6

. Considering that PIB-2- and PIB-4-ATPases have overlapping cargo range, share overall topology and that they release ions in free form to the extracellular environment, in contrast to their PIB-1 counterparts, we find it likely that they employ similar exit pathways, lined primarily by M2, M4, M5, and M6 ( Figure 2d; Wang et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2014 )

. Major findings include the observation of an ion-release pathway similar as in the related PIB-2-ATPases, a previously not observed counterion principle for P-type ATPases, and a unique potassium-independent regulation of the PIB-transport cycle ( Figure 4 ). Thus, our results significantly increase the understanding of heavy-metal homeostasis in cells

. To address these fundamental questions, we determined structures of a PIB-4-ATPase in different states and validated our findings using in vitro functional characterization.

. The residue also overlays with the conserved E202 in SsZntA ( Figure 2f ), which has been suggested to serve as a transient metal ligand, stimulating substrate release from the CPC motif of PIB-2-ATPases ( Wang et al., 2014 ). We propose a similar role for E120 in sCoaT as further supported by the decreased activity of E120A sCoaT form ( Figure 2a ). Many P-type ATPases couple ion- and counter transport, and hence the reaction cycle cannot be completed without counterions

. Examination of the structures reveals that the PIB-4-ATPase architecture is reminiscent to that of other P-type ATPases, with three cytosolic domains, A ( actuator ), N ( nucleotide-binding ), and P ( phosphorylation ), as well as a membrane-spanning M-domain ( Figure 1a ). Furthermore, the core of the soluble portions, including the nucleotide-binding pocket and catalytic phosphorylation site at D369, are well conserved

., 2019 ). We determined structures of sCoaT in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu+, and Ni+, and found that the ATPase activity was inhibited in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca+, but not Zn+ and Ni+ ( Figure 3 ). This is in contrast to P-IB-1 and P-2-ATPases, which are inhibited by Zn2+ and Cu+ ( Wang et al, 2014; Zielinski et al, 2012 ), and P-2-ATP which is inhibited by Zn+ and Ni ( Raim et al,2012; Moreno et al,2008; Scherer and Nies,200; Seigneur-Bern et,2006 ). The lack of inhibition by Zn+ in P-4-ATPases is likely due to the absence of classical HMB, which are present in P-1 and P-2-ATPases ( Wang et al,201; Zielinski et,201; Raim et,201; Moreno et al,2008; Scher and N,200; Seeur-B,2006 ) and P-2-AT ( Wang et,201; Raim,201; Moreno et,8; Sch and,200; Se,2006 ), which are known to bind Zn+ and Cu ( Wang et,201; Ziel et,201; Raim,201; Moreno et,8; Sch and,200; Se,6 )

    Title: Chromatin signature of widespread monoallelic expression
    Abstract: In mammals, numerous autosomal genes are subject to mitotically stable monoallelic expression ( MAE ), including genes that play critical roles in a variety of human diseases. Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and silencing ( H3K27me3 ) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in ∼20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.

    Supporting Text:
   . Upon applying this approach to a variety of cell types, we estimate that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. Since detection of the MAE signature does not rely on SNPs or on sample clonality, we expect that this approach will make feasible the analysis of MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue

. Taken together, these analyses lead to two unexpected conclusions: ( a ) among widely expressed genes, about 20% have a chromatin pattern characteristic for MAE in at least one tissue; ( b ) taking genes with tissue-specific expression as a group, we estimate that between 39% and 48% have the MAE pattern. The genes with MAE chromatin signature share some pronounced features as a group

. Importantly, MAE identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in a polyclonal sample. To broadly test this chromatin signature as a predictor of the MAE state, we identified novel genes with the MAE chromatin pattern, and assessed their allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines. Specifically, we calculated gene-body signal for H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 for all autosomal RefSeq genes based on the ENCODE ChIP-seq data for GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells ( Figure 1C )

. To our surprise, we found that a remarkably large fraction of the known bivalent genes ( >80% ) acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher even when compared to other genes that are also silent in ES cells ( Figure 6A ). Our observations indicate that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature. 10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 013Figure 6

. Detection of MAE by expression bias is not possible in polyclonal cell populations as both paternal and maternal transcripts are present, making expression appear biallelic.

Building and performance of chromatin feature classifiers

. MAE chromatin signature in multiple cell types. ( A ) Comparison of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 ChIP-Seq gene body signal distribution for the autosomal genes in GM12878 cells ( red ) and in primary peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMC; blue ). Silent genes ( RPKM < 0. 1 ) are excluded in either case. Both datasets were collected by ENCODE; PBMC data: GSE16368. Note that the dots are made more transparent than in Figure 1 to make clear the overall shape of the distribution

Using a systematic machine learning approach, we identified and then experimentally validated a specific and sensitive signature for MAE: a gene-body overlap between chromatin marks for active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and gene silencing ( H3K27me3 ). Interestingly, the promoter signal carried very little additional information relative to the gene-body features ( Figure1—figure supplement 3 )

. ) We interpret these observations to mean that the H3K36me3–H3K27me3 gene body signature is a general feature of monoallelic expression in multiple types of human cells, while a particular set of affected genes can be cell type-specific. It should be noted that the correspondence of the chromatin signature to monoallelic expression has only been systematically validated in clonal LCL lines ( see Figure 2 and Figure 3 )

. Similarity of precision and recall values suggests that the two chromatin marks, H3K27me3 and K3K36me3, account for most of the difference between MAE and BAE genes. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 00510. 7554/eLife. 01256. 006Figure 1—figure supplement 3. Distribution of various promoter and/or normalized gene body signal combinations in GM12878 cells in our training set

., 2012 ). At the same time, asymmetric distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 within the gene body of MAE genes is consistent with a very simple asymmetric model: H3K27me3 is known to be associated with transcriptionally silenced chromatin, and H3K36me3 is associated with gene bodies of the actively transcribed genes ( Black et al., 2012 )

. The analysis in the rest of this section should be understood as being performed on genes that have a particular chromatin signature, which at least in one cell type strongly correlates with monoallelic expression. The greater the biological similarity between cell types, the greater the overlap in MAE genes ( Figure 5D )

. Our study strongly implies that very similar sets of genes are subject to MAE in different individuals: the presence of the H3K36me3/H3K27me3 chromatin pattern in one individual corresponds to MAE in the same cell type in another individual. A parsimonious hypothesis is that the capacity for MAE is genetically controlled by regulatory DNA sequences, presumably in cis to the affected MAE genes

Histone modifications, in their diversity, present rich combinatorial possibilities for controlling gene transcription ( Barski et al., 2007; Ernst and Kellis, 2010; Filion et al., 2010 ). They therefore offer a constrained yet rich set of data for systematic analysis. To identify histone modifications that might be specific to the MAE genes, we compared chromatin marks associated with known MAE genes against those for known biallelically expressed ( BAE ) genes

. 10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 013Figure 6. MAE chromatin signature in bivalent genes. ( A ) Overrepresentation of bivalent genes among predicted MAE genes. Predicted: predicted MAE in at least one cell line and not silent ( RPKM > 0. 1 ) ; not predicted: not predicted MAE in any cell line. Groups of genes: ( top ) not bivalent, silent in hESC ( RPKM < 0. 1 ) ; ( middle ) not bivalent, not silent in hESCs; ( bottom ) reported bivalent in human ES cells

. We then set out to analyze in a systematic way whether some combination of these measured signals can reliably distinguish known MAE genes and known biallelic genes. 10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 003Figure 1. Genes with monoallelic expression have specific chromatin signature within the gene body. ( A ) Assessment of histone modifications

. Our finding of a specific combination of molecular markers associated with autosomal MAE creates opportunities for a deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying this epigenetic phenomenon. The presence of H3K27me3 immediately implies that histone methyltransferase EZH2, and possibly other components of the PRC2 complex ( Margueron and Reinberg, 2011 ), could be involved in MAE maintenance

. This is particularly striking since the experimental data for these two related cell types were collected in two different laboratories. This suggests that the genes with MAE signature in lymphoblasts are quite similar to those in the related ex vivo cells. 10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 011Figure 5. MAE chromatin signature in multiple cell types

. 1 ) was 18, 248, among which the total number of genes with the chromatin signature of MAE in at least one cell line was 8716 ( 48% ). Extrapolation of this trend indicates that, with a large number of cell types, about half of all genes would be predicted to have MAE in one or more cell type. Qualitatively similar results remain if a higher expression threshold is applied, such as RPKM>1 ( 39% at seven cell lines )

. In addition, the genes with MA chromatin signature are enriched among those that have bivalent chromatin in pluripotent cells ( Figure 6 ), which is consistent with the idea that MA is linked to cell differentiation.

    Title: Regulatory coiled-coil domains promote head-to-head assemblies of AAA+ chaperones essential for tunable activity control
    Abstract: Ring-forming AAA+ chaperones exert ATP-fueled substrate unfolding by threading through a central pore. This activity is potentially harmful requiring mechanisms for tight repression and substrate-specific activation. The AAA+ chaperone ClpC with the peptidase ClpP forms a bacterial protease essential to virulence and stress resistance. The adaptor MecA activates ClpC by targeting substrates and stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. We show how ClpC is repressed in its ground state by determining ClpC cryo-EM structures with and without MecA. ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains ( MDs ). MecA converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure by binding to MD interaction sites. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. These findings unravel an unexpected regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.

    Supporting Text:
    In the presented work we established a new mechanism of activity control of ClpC, a central AAA+ chaperone widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria. We show that coiled-coil MDs control ClpC activity in a unique manner by sequestering ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state. Our findings extend the role of coiled-coil MDs as regulatory devices controlling AAA+ protein activity

. In the ClpB/Hsp104 disaggregase a long coiled-coil middle domain ( MD ), consisting of two wings, is forming a repressing belt around the AAA ring to reduce ATPase activity ( Carroni et al., 2014; Heuck et al., 2016 ). Adjacent MDs bind to each other by head-to-tail interactions keeping the regulatory domains in place. ATPase repression is relieved by MD dissociation and binding to Hsp70 adaptors that prevent reassociation of MDs with the ClpB/Hsp104 ring ( Oguchi et al

. This task is frequently executed by adapter proteins that select substrates but can also regulate the ATPase activity of AAA+ proteins and couple substrate delivery to ATPase activation ( Oguchi et al., 2012; Schlothauer et al., 2003 ). Activity control and adaptor action requires the ATPase activity to be repressed in the ground state, which is key to AAA+ chaperone mode of action. Repression can be achieved by regulatory coiled-coil domains inserted into an AAA module

. Instead, ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules arranged in a helical conformation ( Figure 7 ). The formation of this structure also involves ATP binding to AAA domains. We define this large ClpC assembly as inactive resting state, as it strongly restricts binding of substrates, ClpP and adaptor proteins and does not allow for efficient ATP hydrolysis

. We show that mutating a key regulatory MD residue of ClpE also causes cellular toxicity, strongly suggesting that the repressing mode of MDs established here for ClpC is also operational in ClpE and ClpL and thus is a more general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems. Severe toxicity of ClpC and ClpE MD mutants qualifies these AAA+ chaperones as targets for antimicrobials

., 2012; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013 ). The bacterial AAA+ chaperone ClpC associates with the peptidase ClpP to form a central proteolytic machinery of Gram-positive bacteria. The ClpC-ClpP machinery acts in regulatory and general proteolysis, controlling multiple cellular pathways and differentiation processes and is crucial for bacterial stress resistance and virulence ( Turgay et al., 1997; Frees et al., 2014; Trentini et al., 2016; Capestany et al

. Together these findings demonstrate an essential role of MD mediated activity control for cellular viability. The Hsp100 family members ClpE and ClpL harbor a coiled-coil MD that is similar in size to the ClpC MD and also displays some sequence homology. Notably, F436 and R443, identified here as key MD residues in ClpC activity control, are largely conserved in ClpE and ClpL M-domains ( Figure 6C )

To study the function of the M-domain ( MD ) in ClpC activity control we first purified S. aureus ClpC/ClpP and demonstrated functionality by determining high-proteolytic activity in presence of the adaptor MecA ( Figure 1 ). Next, we created a series of ClpC MD variants by mutating conserved residues not involved in coiled-coil structure formation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A )

. However, ATPase activation alone is not sufficient to explain ClpC activation as ΔN-ClpC did not allow degradation of GFP-SsrA despite having increased basal ATPase activity. This indicates specific consequences of MD mutations on ClpC conformation and activity. To understand the structural basis underlying the control of ClpC activity by the MD, we determined the cryo-EM structures of S. aureus ClpC with and without its activator MecA in the presence of ATPγS

. MDs of the ClpB/Hsp104 disaggregases function as molecular toggles, which are crucial for AAA+ protein repression in the ground state and activation by an Hsp70 partner chaperone ( Oguchi et al., 2012; Heuck et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Seyffer et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 7 ). Repression by ClpB/Hsp104 MDs relies on formation of a repressing belt around a canonical AAA+ ring by interacting with AAA-1 domains and neighboring MDs

., 2009; Turgay et al., 1998 ). MecA binds to N-terminal and middle domains of each ClpC subunit forming a separate layer on top of the ClpC AAA ring ( Wang et al., 2011 ). How ClpC is kept inactive in adaptor absence, and how the adaptor activates the ATPase is largely unknown. Furthermore, ClpC harbors a coiled-coil MD consisting only of a single wing, as opposed to the two-wing MD of ClpB/Hsp104

. Taken together, our structures of ClpC alone or in complex with MecA show a dramatic reorganization from a helical resting state to a planar canonical AAA+ hexamer, explaining ClpC activation by the adaptor MecA. Intermolecular head-to-head contacts of MDs form the backbone of the ClpC resting state, qualifying the MD as crucial negative regulatory element consistent with MD mutant characterization

., 2005; Kirstein et al., 2009 ). Understanding ClpC activity control therefore might open new avenues for antibiotics development. Here, we report on an unexpected mode of AAA+ chaperone control involving transition between an inactive resting state and a functional hexamer as revealed by determining the cryoEM-structures of S. aureus ClpC in absence and presence of MecA. The ClpC resting state is composed of two helical ClpC assemblies stabilized by head-to-head MD interactions

. The MD-MD head-to-head interaction stops the formation of virtually infinite spirals as in the Hsp104 crystal arrangements allowing the formation of a compact, repressed ClpC reservoir. We envision the helical ClpC assembly as a dynamic inactive resting state, which will interfere with substrate binding, association of the ClpP peptidase and interaction with adaptor proteins. The S

. Thereby ClpC MDs function as molecular switches, similar to ClpB/Hsp104 MDs, ensuring repression in the ground state and allowing for activation in presence of substrate recruiting adaptors ( Figure 7 ). This dual activity is best illustrated for MD residue F436 located at the tip of the coiled-coil structure. F436 is essential for both, intermolecular MD interaction and MecA binding ( Figure 7 )

. Combining ΔN-ClpC with M-domain mutants had an additive stimulatory effect on ATPase activities, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are distinct from one another ( Figure 2A ). We infer increased basal ATPase activities of ClpC MD mutants ( in context of fullength ClpC and ΔN-ClpC ) can explain adaptor-independent substrate degradation

. The AAA+ domains are staggered with a rise of ~20 Å per subunit ( Figure 3B ). N-domains domains are packed between MDs and are displaced so that they lie on top of the adjacent small AAA1 subdomain ( Figure 3B/C ). The MDs coiled-coils constitute the backbone of the spiral and mediate the spiral head-to-head contacts, which involve residues F436, R443 and D444 providing a structural rationale for the activated states of respective MD mutants ( Figure 7 ). In contrast to Clp/Hsp MDs, the Clp MD does not form a repressing belt around the AAA+ ring. Instead, the coiled-coil MDs form head-to-head contacts between adjacent ClC subunits ( Figure 7 ). The head-to-head contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil domains of two adjacent ClC subunits ( Figure 7 ). The head-to-head contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil domains of adjacent ClC subunits ( Figure 7 ) The head-to-head contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil domains of adjacent ClC subunits ( Figure 7 ) The head-to contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil of adjacent ClC sub ( Figure 7 ) The head-to contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil of ClC sub ( Figure 7 The head-to contacts are mediated by the coiled-coil of ClC sub ( Figure 7 The head-to are mediated by coiled-coil of ClC ( Figure 7 The head are mediated by coiled-coil Cl ( Figure 7 head are by coiled-coil ( Figure 7 are coiled by co (7

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers discovered a new mechanism of control for the AAA+ chaper Clp, a crucial for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. They found that coiled-coil domains in Clp control its activity by sequestering it in an inactive state. The coiled-coil domains form head-to-head contacts between Clp molecules, creating a helical assembly that restricts substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. Mutating key residues in the coiled-coil causes constitutive activation and cellular toxicity, suggesting this is a general mechanism for bacterial AAA chaper systems. The findings open new avenues for antibiotic development.

    Title: Muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade reactivates dormant Adult Muscle Precursors in Drosophila
    Abstract: How stem cells specified during development keep their non-differentiated quiescent state, and how they are reactivated, remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2010 ) argues for this possibility. Taken together, our data reveal several new features of the transient Drosophila muscle stem cells called AMPs, particularly their direct contact with muscles, which behave as an AMPs niche. Muscle appears to be the source of local inductive Insulin signals that reactivate AMPs and, via non-canonical Notch and its target dMyc, induce their proliferation in larval stages ( Figure 8 )

. Indeed, dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation ( Figure 4H–K, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 ), thus providing evidence that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates. To gain a better understanding of the functional link between Insulin, Notch and dMyc in AMP cell behavior, we analyzed their activity in reactivated AMPs

. We have previously characterized the Drosophila muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ) that emerge during mid-embryogenesis and express muscle progenitor-specific markers such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist ( Figeac et al., 2007, 2010 ). The AMPs lie dormant during embryonic and most of larval life but once activated they will proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts that ensure adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles

., 2006; Liao et al., 2007; Ishikawa et al., 2013 ), and Myc promotes the proliferation of myoblasts during development and regeneration ( Li et al., 2012 ), we tested whether dMyc was involved in AMP reactivation in Drosophila. Our data show that dMyc is indeed required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic rescue experiments show that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 08497. 027 Taken together, the data suggest that muscle behaves as an AMP niche and plays a driving role in AMP reactivation in later larval life ( see AMP reactivation scheme, Figure 8 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 08497. 028Figure 8. Niche role of muscle in AMP reactivation. Scheme illustrating the muscle niche-induced Insulin/Notch/dMyc cascade governing the reactivation of dormant AMPs

. We provide genetic evidence that muscles act via dIlp6 to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate AMP reactivation. This leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch, which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc.

. During embryonic stages, quiescent AMPs send out filopodia and make contact with neighboring muscles. These AMP-to-muscle ties persist until the AMPs are reactivated at mid-second larval instar, facilitating the reception of the inductive dIlp6 signal emitted by the muscle niche. In reactivated AMP ( depicted in red ), activation of the Insulin pathway leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch and induces AMP proliferation through the Notch target Myc. DOI: http://dx. doi

. It has previously been shown that the Insulin/TOR signaling pathway controls the exit of Drosophila neural stem cells from their dormant state ( Chell and Brand, 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011 ). Global gene expression profiling also revealed that Insulin Growth Factor ( IGF ) signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells ( Pallafacchina et al., 2010 ). We therefore tested whether the Insulin pathway could reactivate Drosophila AMPs

. The AMPs that are at the origin of adult Drosophila muscles are quiescent from mid-embryogenesis until the mid of the second larval instar ( Figure 3 )

. Our data reveal that the AMPs maintain their elongated shapes with filopodia extending along the muscle niche during the first events of proliferation, which supports the view that muscles play an instructive role during AMP reactivation. AMPs are reactivated from their quiescent state at the mid-second larval instar, but the signals and intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating their entry into proliferation remain unknown

. A similar observation was recently reported in Drosophila intestinal stem cells in which proliferation and differentiation is finely tuned by the interplay between the Insulin and Notch pathways ( Foronda et al., 2014 ). However, the issue of whether the Insulin-dependent regulation of Notch involves conventional Delta/Serrate signal transduction has never been addressed

. Interestingly, it has been shown that coordinated activation of Insulin and Notch pathways also regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal Drosophila stem cells ( Foronda et al., 2014 ). Here, our data suggest that Notch pathway activation downstream of Insulin involves Deltex and is likely ligand-independent ( Figure 7 )

. The key role of the Insulin pathway in AMP proliferation raised an obvious question as to the source and identity of the Insulin Receptor ( InR ) ligand initiating AMP reactivation. In Drosophila, three Insulin-like peptides ( dIlp2, dIlp3 and dIlp5 ) secreted to the hemolymph by mNSC cells control the systemic growth of the organism ( Brogiolo et al., 2001 ), whereas dIlp6 produced by the glial cells acts locally and promotes the proliferation of the neuroblasts ( Sousa-Nunes et al

. The internal organs were removed to expose the body-wall muscles, and mounted on a coverslip to visualize AMPs under the confocal microscope. Genetic epistasis experiments were performed to determine interactions between Insulin and Notch pathways and between Notch and dMyc during AMP reactivation

. Thus, like for satellite cells ( Chakkalakal et al., 2012 ), muscle appears to play a niche role while also proving essential to the activation of quiescent AMPs ( Figure 8 ). Whether the Insulin/IGF signals play a conserved role in this process remains an open question, but the finding that numerous IGF signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells ( Pallafacchina et al., 2010 ) argues for this possibility

. Here, we showed that m6-Gal4-targeted expression of the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) in embryonic AMPs does not alter their quiescence in embryos ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). However, in the same NICD context, there were significantly higher numbers of AMPs in third-instar larvae, suggesting that Notch reactivates AMPs in larval stages and promotes their proliferation ( Figure 4F, J, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 )

., 2012 ) and satellite cell engraftment in cell therapy approaches ( Boldrin et al., 2012 ). The stem-like Drosophila AMPs specified in mid-embryogenesis lie at the origin of all the adult Drosophila muscles ( Bate et al., 1991 ), but the lack of appropriate genetic tools means we still know little of their behavior and niche requirements

. The sum of these observations prompted us to determine whether dMyc acted as an effector of Insulin and Notch pathways, and whether Notch functioned downstream of Insulin during AMP proliferation. We found that lowering Notch or dMyc levels in AMPs expressing InRCA led to an attenuation of the AMP overproliferation phenotype, indicating that both Notch and dMyc act downstream of the Insulin pathway ( Figure 5E–G, L, M, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 )

. We found that Insulin and TOR signaling components effectively promote the exit of AMPs from their dormant state, while also positively regulating AMP proliferation. However, increased Insulin/TOR signaling alone is not sufficient to end AMP quiescence during embryonic stages, suggesting that additional signals are required for AMP reactivation ( Figure 4— figure supplement 1 and 4—source 1 )

    Title: The leak channel NALCN controls tonic firing and glycolytic sensitivity of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons
    Abstract: Certain neuron types fire spontaneously at high rates, an ability that is crucial for their function in brain circuits. The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN.

   ., 2014 ). Here we report our efforts to identify the nonselective cation channel ( NSCC ) that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and determine the molecular identity of the glycolysis-sensitive NSCC. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons and, specifically, the relative expression levels of NSCCs. We found that the sodium leak channel, NALCN ( Lu et al., 2007 ), was the highest expressed NSCC in SNr neurons

. Identifying the molecular basis of this current is important to enable detailed investigation of how its properties and regulation underlie SNr tonic inhibition of basal ganglia targets. In order to address this, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of SNr neurons and detected expression of several NSCCs that could potentially generate the tonic depolarizing current

. We discovered that SNr neurons express NALCN, which stood out as a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current in these cells

. Our finding that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, suggests that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia related motor disorders. For example, disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists, leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia ( Burbaud et al., 1998 ). In addition, hyperactivity of the SNr is observed in Parkinsonian animals ( Wichmann et al

. In particular, NALCN stood out as a promising candidate for the tonic depolarizing current, as it had the highest expression of all NSCCs ( Figure 3B ) and its expression was in the top 20% of all ion channels ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). In addition, we found that SNr neurons express Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155a, three genes whose protein products are known to interact with NALCN ( Xie et al., 2013; Ren, 2011 ) ( Figure 3D )

. Our results demonstrate that NALCN is necessary for normal spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and for the regulation of SNr excitability. The combined results of these studies are consistent with the idea that NALCN is a critical component of neuronal excitability in many rhythmically active neurons ( Ren, 2011 ). NALCN also appears to mediate several modulatory influences on SNr firing

. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic techniques, we showed that: 1 ) NALCN is functionally active in SNr neurons; 2 ) NALCN is an important component of the machinery that maintains spontaneous firing in SNr neurons, 3 ) NALCN is required for sensitivity of SNr neuron firing to glycolysis, and 4 ) NALCN is important for muscarinic receptor-dependent stimulation of SNr neuron firing

. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ), GABAergic neurons fire spontaneously at relatively high firing rates, typically 30 spikes per second ( Sanderson et al., 1986; Gulley et al., 1999; Maurice et al., 2003; Deransart et al., 2003 ). This spontaneous firing is necessary for the tonic inhibition of downstream targets of the SNr and thus critical for the function of the basal ganglia ( Chevalier and Deniau, 1990; Hikosaka, 2007 )

. Electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological inhibitors supported a critical function of NALCN in maintaining firing, and conditional knockout of NALCN in SNr neurons impaired firing, confirming its importance. In addition, we found that the loss of NALCN significantly impaired modulation of SNr firing by glycolytic inhibition and by muscarinic metabotropic receptor activation, indicating that NALCN was involved in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability

. Recent studies have reported that NALCN is expressed by other neurons in the brain ( Lu et al., 2007; Flourakis et al., 2015; Goldberg et al., 2012 ), indicating that our findings in the SNr may be more broadly applicable. Furthermore, our results identify key cellular responses that are impaired in the absence of NALCN, and may have therapeutic value as human mutations in NALCN lead to severe motor and cognitive deficits ( Chong et al., 2015; Aoyagi et al., 2015; Al-Sayed et al

., 2013; Fukai et al., 2016 ). In addition, humans carrying mutations in UNC80, a protein that is important for the function of NALCN ( Ren, 2011 ), show severe deficits that mirror those observed in humans with mutations in NALCN ( Perez et al., 2015; Shamseldin et al., 2016; Stray-Pedersen et al., 2016 ). The SNr is a main output of the basal ganglia motor circuit and provides tonic inhibition of target areas ( Hikosaka, 2007 )

. Taken together, these results indicate that TRPC channels are not required to maintain the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and are unlikely to provide the basis for the tonic depolarizing current. To clarify which NSSC are expressed by SNr neurons, we chose an unbiased approach that took advantage of advances in RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) technology to obtain whole transcriptome gene expression data from individual SNr neurons

., 2000; Jackson et al., 2004; Taddese and Bean, 2002; Khaliq and Bean, 2010 ). Spontaneously firing GABAergic SNr neurons provide a key source of inhibitory tone to target areas including the superior colliculus and pedunculopontine nucleus ( Hikosaka, 2007 ). In SNr neurons, a sodium-dependent, TTX-insensitive depolarizing current has been attributed to a NSCC, but the molecular identity of this current remains undefined ( Atherton and Bevan, 2005 )

. We find that it is important for regulation of SNr neuronal excitability in response to changes in glycolysis, an effect we had seen previously when investigating metabolic influences on SNr firing rate ( Lutas et al., 2014 ). Together with our finding that the increased firing produced by muscarinic receptor activation is blunted in NALCN KO SNr neurons, these results suggest that tuning the level of NALCN activity may set both the tonic and phasic excitability of SNr neurons

. These data confirm that a decreased steady-state inward current mediates the slowing in firing rate observed for NALCN KO neurons. The spontaneous activity of SNr neurons is modulated by cellular metabolism ( Lutas et al., 2014; Yamada, 2001; Ma et al., 2007 )

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 15271. 007 Given that Gd3+ is not a specific blocker and may affect other channels, blockade of channels other than NALCN may be contributing to the effects of Gd3+ on firing rate. To overcome the caveats inherent in the use of nonspecific pharmacological blockers, we used a genetic approach to directly test whether NALCN is necessary for the spontaneous activity of SNr neurons

., 2014 ). We therefore tested the effect of glycolytic inhibition on SNr neurons lacking NALCN, to learn whether NALCN underlies the glycolysis-sensitive nonselective cation current. We measured spontaneous firing rates of control and NALCN KO SNr neurons, and tested the effect of inhibition of glycolysis in the presence of the mitochondrial fuel beta-hydroxybutyrate ( βHB )

., 1999 ) and ablation of the SNr can ameliorate symptoms of Parkinson’s diseases ( Wichmann et al., 2001 ). Therefore, understanding the function of NALCN in modulating the tonic activity of SNr neurons may lead to a more detailed mechanistic understanding of motor dysfunction in humans and potentially provide a new therapeutic target for motor disorders

. Taken together, our findings support a critical role of NALCN in both maintenance of spontaneous firing and modulation of SNr excitability by glycol and muscarinic receptor activation.
Researchers have developed a droplet-based microfluidic system for high-throughput cultivation and screening of antibiotic-producing microorganisms from complex microbial communities. The system consists of three phases: droplet generation, incubation, and screening. In the first phase, cells are separated and encapsulated in droplets, which are then collected and incubated in a vessel. In the second phase, reporter strains are added to the droplets to detect antimicrobial activity. The third phase involves isolating cells from droplets on agar plates. This approach enables the cultivation of uncultured species and higher bacterial diversity compared to standard plate cultivation. A variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected from selected isolates, including a potent antibiotic producer. The system provides genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, allowing compounds to be confined with the cell of origin. Droplets can be stored and incubated under controlled conditions. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products was implemented using reporter strains in droplets. The combination of cultivation and screening streamlines efforts towards new antibiotic development. The strategy was verified by culturing a complex community in a substrate and comparing to agar cultivation for the same sample. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity in dro screening and secreted metabolites were identified. The system was applied to a soil community rich in recalcant and slow-growing genera, demonstrating advantages of in-dro cultivation. A dro-microfluid platform was used to singularize, cultivate, and screen cells from environmental communities. The workflow featured three phases: droplet generation, incubation, and screening. Cells were separated and encapsulated in droplets during generation, then collected and incubated in a vessel. Reporter strains were added to detect antimicrobial activity. Cells were isolated from droplets on agar. The strategy has proven adaptable to fastidious microorganisms and sources of natural products. The diversity of natural habitats, including limited access samples, will be explored with this approach.

    Title: A Bayesian analysis of the association between Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis
    Abstract: Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality, linked to excessive inflammation. However, adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids. LTA4H TT patients with increased expression had increased survival, consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, an Indonesia study did not find an LTA4H TT genotype survival benefit. Here using Bayesian methods to analyse both studies, we find that LTA4H TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. LTA4H genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2012 ). These findings supported the model that mortality from TBM was due to two distinct inflammatory states, and that LTA4H genotype might be a critical determinant of inflammation and consequently of the response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment. If true, then personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment would be warranted, with the drug given only to TT patients

. Such a previously unrecognized form of dysregulated inflammation might be caused by other genetic variants uniquely present in the Indonesia patients and would work through an inflammatory pathway that is less responsive to dexamethasone. Why was the LTA4H TT effect thought to be limited to the least severe patients in both cohorts ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 )? Two reasons might explain this

. Because the Indonesia cohort was skewed towards more severe disease on presentation, one explanation for the lack of an LTA4H genotype association with survival in Indonesia was that the underlying association is overridden by severe disease, a strong independent correlate of mortality ( Fava and Schurr, 2017; Wang et al., 2019 )

. Thus the beneficial effect of dexamethasone to the LTA4H TT group may simply not have had time to come into play in Grade 3 Indonesia patients. A second possibility is that Indonesia Grade 3 patients presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation in a manner not revealed by standard metrics of judging disease severity. If this were the case then corticosteroids might no longer be beneficial

. However, noting that the Indonesia cohort presented with more severe disease and died earlier, they postulated that rather than invoking an unknown genetic phenomenon, it was more likely that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype were nullified in more severe disease. This concept of the disease being too severe for outcomes to be influenced by intervention has precedent

. This high early mortality raised the possibility that the impact of the LTA4H variant differs by disease severity, and may not be relevant in more severe disease ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 ). If so, then the effects of the LTA4H genotype were being masked by the preponderance of extremely severe cases in the Indonesia cohort ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 )

., 2004 ). Patient cohorts were compared overall as well as stratified into disease severity groups based on the TBM grade and by LTA4H genotypes, into the TT group ( previously linked to response to steroids ) and the CC, CT, and combined CC and CT genotypes ( non-TT group ). The Bayesian analysis methods to compare survival probabilities are detailed in Appendix 2

. This higher mortality could potentially explain the finding that the LTA4H TT survival advantage did not extend to Indonesia Grade 3 patients. It may be that the TT genotype advantage, in response to corticosteroid treatment, is overridden by other factors that cause extreme mortality.

. This would be particularly important given the possible harm to the hypo-inflammatory CC group, as well as the adverse effects of long-term high dose treatment with a broadly acting immunosuppressant. To further these findings, two new studies of the association of LTA4H genotype with TBM survival in HIV-negative patients were performed in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively ( Thuong et al., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 )

. One possibility is that better ancillary care was possible in Vietnam where all patients were enrolled into a clinical trial versus only 17% in Indonesia ( Thuong et al., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 ). The excess Grade 3 Indonesia mortality peaked within days, and optimized respiratory support, in particular, would be essential to keep patients alive through the early high risk stage in order allow for anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids to benefit the TT patients

Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, it results in 20–25% mortality in HIV-negative individuals and ~40% mortality in HIV-positive individuals ( Stadelman et al., 2020; Thwaites et al., 2013 ). A long-standing hypothesis that an excessive intracerebral inflammatory response underlies TBM mortality ( Shane and Riley, 1953 ) led to multiple trials of adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids ( e

. The severity grade-specific analyses, coupled with temporal analyses made possible by Bayesian methods, reveal that the LTA4H TT genotype is associated with survival in both cohorts.

. Non-TT patients had similar mortality in Indonesia Grade 2 and Vietnam Grade 3 ( compare Figure 2G to D ). Thus, Bayesian analysis revealed an LTA4H TT survival association in Indonesia as well. The association being only in Grade 2 and not in Grade 3 patients suggested an upper limit of disease severity for its efficacy

. Again survival of CC and CT patients was not significantly different at any time during the 270 day observation period ( data not shown ). In sum, our analysis revealed that in Vietnam, LTA4H TT was associated with survival, not in mild disease as suggested earlier ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 ), but rather in the most severe disease grade. In fact, the bulk of the overall association was being driven by Grade 3 patients who constituted only 15. 9% of the cohort ( Table 1 )

. Findings in a zebrafish model of TB provided a testable hypothesis for a mechanism underlying this heterogeneity ( Thwaites et al., 2004; Tobin et al., 2012; Tobin et al., 2010 ). The zebrafish findings suggested that either deficiency or excess of leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ), a key enzyme that regulates the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, increase susceptibility to TBM for opposite reasons - too little or too much inflammation ( Tobin et al

., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 ). Because glucocorticoid adjunctive therapy had become standard of care owing to the benefit observed in the randomised controlled trial ( Thwaites et al., 2004 ), all patients received it in both studies. Therefore, the prediction that could be tested was that TT mortality is less than CC+CT mortality. Whereas the Vietnam study confirmed this prediction, the Indonesia study did not. The Vietnam cohort had an overall mortality of 18

. 6 fold higher than Vietnam ). Disease severity as assessed by BMRC Grade or GCS at presentation is also a strong predictor of earlier death ( Fava and Schurr, 2017; Wang et al., 2019 ), and the Indonesia patients died sooner ( median time to death 8 days versus 50 days in Vietnam ) ( Table 1 ). If LTA4H genotype associates with survival most strongly in mild disease, then the association seen for the entire Vietnam cohort ( Thuong et al

. This is not only to target such treatments to those who will benefit, but to avoid their adverse effects in those individuals who have little chance of experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from them. Our finding that the LTA4H TT genotype’s salutary role is incumbent on the optimization of other factors that maximize patient survival has broad implications for pharmacogenomic approaches.

. These factors appear independent of severity grade on presentation, and if they exceed a threshold ( represented by about ~40% mortality ) then the beneficial effect of LTA4H TT is lost. A limitation of this study is that we cannot definitively determine the causes of this LTA4H genotype-independent excess Grade 3 mortality in Indonesia because the patient populations, hospital care protocols and the availability of intensive care differed between each study site

The finding in two independent cohorts in Vietnam collected from 2001 to 2004 and 2011–2015 that a common functional human variant was associated with responsiveness to adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment in TBM represented an ideal example of pharmacogenomics, coming as it did from mechanistic understanding of the underlying reason ( Sadée and Dai, 2005; Thuong et al., 2017; vanaroven et al. 2017 )

    Title: Gradient-reading and mechano-effector machinery for netrin-1-induced axon guidance
    Abstract: Growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. However, it is unclear how they can decide the migratory direction by transducing the local spatial cues into protrusive forces. Here we show that knockout mice of Shootin1 display abnormal projection of the forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of the axon guidance molecule netrin-1. Shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicited highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. We demonstrate that netrin-1–elicited shootin1 phosphorylation increases shootin1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM; this, in turn, promotes F-actin–adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Moreover, the spatially regulated shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients. Our study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.

    Supporting Text:
   . Our data demonstrate that shootin1a, through its spatially regulated phosphorylation within growth cones, mediates the gradient reading and mechanoresponse for netrin-1–induced axon guidance.

. We show that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that Shootin1 knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons, a phenotype similar to that of Netrin-1 knockout mice. Notably, very small spatial differences in netrin-1 concentration elicited highly polarized directional phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones

. Netrin-1–elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promoted direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, thereby generating traction force for growth cone motility. Furthermore, disturbance of the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibited axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients

. Furthermore, uncoupling of F-actin-adhesion coupling by shootin1a ( 1-125 ) inhibited netrin-1–induced axon outgrowth and turning on laminin ( Figure 7—figure supplement 4A–C and E ). Together, these data indicate that netrin-1–induced axon guidance, which is mediated by the shootin1a–L1-CAM interaction, is not limited to growth cones on L1-CAM. Finally, we analyzed the role of polarized shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones elicited by netrin-1 gradients

., 2009; Rappaz et al., 2016 ). Tracing the spatial signals from phosphorylated shootin1a back upstream to DCC will lead to a better molecular understanding of the gradient-reading mechanism involved in netrin-1–regulated axon guidance. The present study has shown that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that Shootin1 knockout mice display dysgenesis and misprojection of these axons

. This polarized phosphorylation locally promotes shootin1a–L1-CAM and shootin1a–cortactin interactions within growth cones and asymmetrically promote traction force ( blue arrows, F Figure 8E ) on the side of the netrin-1 source, leading to a decision for the migratory direction ( white arrow, Figure 8E )

. These results demonstrate that the disturbance of axon turning caused by depletion of shootin1a ( Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 2D ) or by dominant negative shootin1a ( Figure 7—figure supplement 3B ) is not attributed only to the inhibited axon outgrowth, and suggest that the polarized phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones is required for the directional axon guidance induced by netrin-1 gradients ( Figure 8E ).

. Overexpression of myc-shootin1a ( 1-125 ) also decreased axon length and abolished the netrin-1–induced axon outgrowth ( Figure 6―figure supplement 1B and Figure 6E ), suggesting that shootin1a–L1-CAM interaction is involved in the netrin-1–induced generation of traction force for growth cone migration. Next, we examined whether shootin1a is involved in netrin-1–induced axon guidance

. The neurons were then fixed and immunolabeled with an antibody that recognizes shootin1a phosphorylation at Ser249. We selected axons located near the center of the gradients ( red rectangle, Figure 2A ) and that were oriented approximately perpendicular to the netrin-1 gradient. To our surprise, quantification of the phospho-shootin1a immunoreactivity and CMAC staining revealed a highly polarized localization of the phosphorylated shootin1a within growth cones ( Figure 2C )

., 2013 ) but cannot be regulated by phosphorylation, displacement of wild-type shootin1a with shootin1a-DD would disturb netrin-1–induced polarized shootin1a regulation without disturbing the clutch coupling. As shown by Figure 8B–D and Video 11, disturbance of polarized shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones by this displacement inhibited growth cone turning toward the netrin-1 source without reducing axon outgrowth velocity

. Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative Pak1 decreased shootin1a phosphorylation and inhibited the interaction ( Figure 4A and B ). Furthermore, stimulation of neurons by netrin-1 increased the phosphorylation of shootin1a at Ser101 and Ser249 ( Figure 4C and D ) ; this led to a concomitant increase in the interaction between endogenous shootin1a and L1-CAM ( Figure 4C and D ). In axonal growth cones, phosphorylated shootin1a was highly colocalized with L1-CAM ( Figure 4E )

., 2013; Kubo et al., 2015 ). However, whether shootin1a mediates axon guidance in vitro and in vivo remains unknown. In addition, how shootin1a associates with the substrates through L1-CAM is uncharacterized ( Kubo et al., 2015 ). Here, we combined gene knockout, protein interaction assays, force microscopy, speckle imaging and microfluidics to define a gradient-reading and mechano-effector machinery for netrin-1–induced axon guidance

., 2008; Demarco et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 8E ). Thus, under the activation of Pak1 via these signaling pathways, the shootin1a phosphorylation enhances both the shootin1a–adhesion and shootin1a–F-actin interactions that lead to increased F-actin–adhesion coupling ( Figure 8E ). This double regulation would enable efficient regulation of forces for axon guidance in response to netrin-1. At present, no information is available on the three-dimensional structure of shootin1a

. In addition, as Shootin1 knockout mice exhibit multiple defects in the brain, we cannot conclude that the dysgenesis of the forebrain commissures is only due to the axon outgrowth and guidance deficits observed in in vitro assays. Generation of conditional knockout mice as well as detailed mapping of netrin-1 will facilitate future analyses of the shootin1a–mediated axon guidance in the brain

. On the other hand, similar gradients of the control molecule BSA in the medium did not elicit polarized phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones ( Figure 2―figure supplement 2 ). We reported previously that netrin-1–induced shootin1a phosphorylation at Ser101 and Ser249 enhances the coupling between F-actin retrograde flow and L1-CAM at growth cones ( Toriyama et al., 2013 )

., 2014 ). However, despite the significant progress in identifying the signaling pathways, little is known about how the netrin-1 signal, as a spatial cue, is converted into the directional force required for axon guidance. Moreover, a molecular understanding of how shallow gradients of chemical cues are read out to guide axons is lacking ( Quinn and Wadsworth, 2008; Hegemann and Peter, 2017 ). Shootin1, recently renamed shootin1a ( Higashiguchi et al

. These data suggest that the interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM mediates netrin-1–induced axon guidance. Laminins are widely used substrates for axon guidance assays ( Turney and Bridgman, 2005; Nichol et al., 2016 ) ; L1-CAM on growth cones interacts directly with laminin presented on the substrate ( Hall et al., 1997; Abe et al., 2018 )

. Thus, the defects in the forebrain commissural axons in Shootin1 knockout mice are consistent with the in vitro observations that shootin1a is required for netrin-1–induced axon outgrowth and guidance. However, although shoot1 is expressed in the developing brain, it is unclear whether shoot1 mediates netrin–induced axon guidance in vivo.

    Title: How oscillating aerodynamic forces explain the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum and other animals in flapping flight
    Abstract: How hummingbirds hum is not fully understood, but its biophysical origin is encoded in the acoustic nearfield. Hence, we studied six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds, performing acoustic nearfield holography using a 2176 microphone array in vivo, while also directly measuring the 3D aerodynamic forces using a new aerodynamic force platform. We corroborate the acoustic measurements by developing an idealized acoustic model that integrates the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, which shows how the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, we find that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originates from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight. Our model analysis across insects and birds shows that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, while also clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior.

    To determine how the flapping wings of hovering hummingbirds generate unsteady aerodynamic forces as well as their namesake acoustic humming signature, we combine aerodynamic force platform ( Figure 1A ) and microphone array recordings ( Figure 1D ) in vivo. The aerodynamic force platform integrates both the steady and unsteady components of the pressure field around the bird up to three times the wingbeat frequency, which are associated with its net 3D aerodynamic forces

. To resolve how the oscillating aerodynamic force generated by flapping wings may contribute to wing hum, we developed a new aerodynamic force platform ( Ingersoll and Lentink, 2018; Lentink et al., 2015; Hightower et al., 2017 ) to directly measure the net 3D aerodynamic force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds. We integrated this data in a new aeroacoustics model to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings

. It integrates in vivo 3D aerodynamic force and wing kinematics measurements and is corroborated spatially and temporally through in vivo nearfield acoustic holography. The measurements and model show that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum. The broadband acoustic pressure is primarily oriented downward opposing gravity, while the acoustic directivity and orientation of the harmonic components depend on harmonic parity

. Our model is idealized in the sense that it assumes the wings are rigid airfoils, thereby neglecting auxiliary effects such as wingtip flutter, feather whistle and ( turbulent ) vortex dynamics. Next, we compared the predicted acoustic field with novel acoustic nearfield recordings for six freely hovering hummingbirds, which corroborates the predictive power of our minimal model

. All these findings point to the potential role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating wing hum. Indeed, numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation ( Williams and Hawkings, 1969 ) showed that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation ( Seo et al., 2019 ). Despite these important advances, in vivo acoustic near-field measurements are lacking

Our idealized aeroacoustic model shows the hummingbird’s hum originates from the oscillating lift and drag forces generated by their flapping wings. Remarkably, the low frequency content in the aerodynamic forces also drives higher frequency harmonics in the acoustic spectrum of the wing hum. The higher harmonics originate from nonlinear frequency mixing in the aeroacoustic pressure equation between the frequency content in the wing’s aerodynamic forces and kinematics

. Finally, there is no simple model that can satisfactorily integrate flapping wing kinematics and aerodynamic forces to predict the acoustic near and far field generated by animals across taxa without using computationally expensive fluid dynamic simulations. Hummingbirds are an ideal subject for developing and testing a model of flapping wing hum: their wing kinematics and unsteady aerodynamic forces are very repeatable during hover ( Altshuler and Dudley, 2003; Tobalske et al

., 2017 ). When fruit flies use their wing as an aeroacoustic instrument during terrestrial courtship serenades; however, they reduce their stroke amplitude to a similar degree ( von Schilcher, 1976; Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1968 ), which likely colors their timbre as in mosquitos ( Figure 4A–D ). Our acoustic model explains how the oscillating lift and drag forces generated by each wing of a hovering hummingbird radiate the distinctive humming timbre

. To determine if the low frequency oscillating forces generated by the birds’ flapping wings drive the characteristic humming sound spectrum, we develop a simple aeroacoustics model based on the governing acoustics equations that predict the resulting acoustic field

. Consequently, the humming sound generated across flapping animal wings can be modeled accurately with a single point force source per wing half, similar to what we found for hummingbirds ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). This even holds for mosquito buzz, the most extreme case among our five paradigm animals, because the mosquito wing’s compactness, R/λ1=0. 006, is equivalent to that of a hummingbird’s 0. 007

. Consequently, it is not fully understood how flapping wings generate their characteristic sound—from the mosquito’s buzz, the hummingbird’s hum, to the larger bird’s whoosh. Our physical understanding of how wings generate sound is primarily based on aircraft wing and rotor aeroacoustics ( Brooks and Pope, 1989; Crighton, 1991 )

. In contrast, the microphone arrays measure the unsteady component of the pressure field around the bird up to ~1000 times the wingbeat frequency ( of which we studied the first ten harmonics ) : the acoustic field. Critically, these two representations of the pressure fluctuations generated by the bird should relate mechanistically if the acoustic field of the hummingbird’s hum originates primarily from the oscillating aerodynamic lift and drag forces generated by the flapping wings

. Our acoustic model predicts hum harmonics that lie in an intermediate frequency range between the wingbeat frequency ( ~40 Hz ) and the lower bound of feather sonations ( typically >300 Hz; Clark et al., 2013a; Clark et al., 2013b ). Hence our model allows for an objective contrast between wing hum sound and other possible aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms

. We then used our validated model to determine how flapping wing hum depends on the frequency content in the oscillating forces across mosquitos, flies, hawkmoths, hummingbirds, and parrotlets in slow hovering flight. Finally, we used these findings to determine how the hum scales with body mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect and bird species.

. Our study shows how this model can elucidate the mechanistic origin of wing hum timbre ( and modulation ) in vivo by integrating acoustic recordings with high-speed videography and aerodynamic force recordings. Likewise, we showed it can be used to make predictions or interpret acoustic measurements by integrating a simplified wing kinematics and aerodynamic force model. It can also be used to estimate the auditory detection distance of wing hum by combining it with an audiogram

. Using our model, we predict the acoustic sound generated by flapping wings for a wide range of insects and birds that hover or perform slow flapping flight during takeoff and landing across seven orders of magnitude in body mass, m, and three orders of magnitude in wing flapping frequency, fw

. Perception of wing whoosh also has implications for bird-insect predation, because moths have been shown to respond to the wingbeat hum of birds in playback experiments ( Fournier et al., 2013 ). Finally, an acoustic model analogous to the one we present here has recently been used to simulate mosquito buzz ( Seo et al., 2019 ) in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics to predict how aerodynamic forces ( Bomphrey et al

. To calculate the associated drag profile, we used previously reported quasi-steady lift/drag ratio data for Anna’s hummingbirds ( Ingersoll and Lentink, 2018; Kruyt et al., 2014 ) and assume it is representative for all animals. Finally, to compute the acoustic field for each animal’s wing, we locate the lift and drag force at the third moment of area of a hummingbird wing, 55% of the wing radius ( which compares to 58% for parrotlets Chin and Lentink, 2017 )

. The associated scaling relation for radiated acoustic power shows how it is proportional to the product of stroke amplitude, body mass and wingbeat frequency squared. Our scaling analysis across 170 different animals in slow hovering flight reveals how the radiated acoustic power scaled with mass. Allometric deviation explains why larger birds radiate less acoustic power than expected and why elongated flies have a remarkably loud buzz as perceived by a casual observer

. Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations of flapping insect wings suggest that the acoustic field can be characterized as a dipole at the wingbeat frequency ( Bae and Moon, 2008; Geng et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2019 ). Further, flapping wing pitch reduction ( Nedunchezian et al., 2018 ) and increased wing flexibility ( Nedunchezian et al., 2019 ) reduces the acoustic power radiated by flapping wings. Our model shows that the acoustic power radiated by flapping is proportional to the product of stroke amplitude, body mass and wingbeat frequency squared, which is consistent with CFD simulations of flapping insect wings ( Bae and Moon,2008; G et al. 2017; Se et al 2019 )
Researchers investigated the roles of chance and necessity in protein evolution by reconstructing and evolving the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein family. They used ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins to acquire protein-protein interaction specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins, they found that contingency generated over historical timescales erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of sequence variation. Trajectories from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded no common mutations even under strong identical pressures. Chance arose many mutations could alter specificity at any point; contingency arose historical substitutions changed these. Results suggest that B-2 sequences and other proteins are idiosyncratic products of particular and unpredictable historical events.

The study found that present-day B-2 proteins are largely anecdotes of their unpredictable histories, reflecting accumulated chance during descent with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and selection. Contingency generated sequence over phylogen times plays a role in B- family evolution under selection for new functions. Human and NO were fixed partners, but during evolution proteins varied, introducing opportunities for chance and contingency to affect sequence outcomes. Additional biological dimensions of B function imposed selective constraints on evolution, reducing functionally genotypes available to chance. Paths leading to P specificities changed during B history, even when profiles did not evolve.

Ancestral B- existed before deuteromes bound B and NO, whereas B- within deuteromes bound only B, as hs- does. Reconstruction was robust to uncertainty in ancestral sequences. Experiments on proteins showed particular mutations had different effects in backgrounds, suggesting contingency, but not extent context dependence influenced outcomes. Evolution studies could characterize chance and contingency with replication from multiple points, but no study has done; imposed selection on proteins acquire functions changed, relevance to evolution unclear.

Contingency arose historical substitutions during intervals made specificity mutations deleterious or inconsequential introduced backgrounds. The study mapped incompatibilities onto phylogeny. Posterior probabilities ancestors ranged from 0.87 to 0.95 with average 0.9. Synthesized alternative reconstructions for key ancestors contained likely states with posterior >0.2 for sites. Comparing outcomes replicates from points quantified chance evolution under strong pressures; comparing outcomes initiated points quantified contingency accumulated changes. A single reconstruction showed B specificity within B- clade. Characterized coreg specificity extant B- class from taxonomic positions. Contingency effect larger than chance, although smaller extent. Data indicate contingency increases unpredictability as sequences diverge history.

    Title: Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa
    Abstract: Similarity between two individuals in the combination of genetic markers along their chromosomes indicates shared ancestry and can be used to identify historical connections between different population groups due to admixture. We use a genome-wide, haplotype-based, analysis to characterise the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups. We show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. In fact, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. Our in-depth analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology.

   ., 2012; Hellenthal et al., 2014; Leslie et al., 2015; Montinaro et al., 2015 ). As well as providing a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups, we identify the dominant events which have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa. We close by discussing the relevance of these observations to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa.

. One insight is the identification of clear, but complex, evidence for the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over a variety of timescales ( Pagani et al., 2012; Pickrell et al., 2014; Gurdasani et al., 2014; Hodgson et al., 2014a; Llorente et al., 2015 ). On a broad sample of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries, the African Genome Variation Project ( AGVP ) ( Gurdasani et al

., 2014; Li et al., 2014 ). These studies have described the novel and important influence of both Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa and provide an important description of the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent, but questions remain of the extent and timing of key events, and their impact on contemporary populations

. The inferred groups reflect broad-scale geographic patterns. At finer scales, our analysis reveals smaller groups, and often differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry ( Tishkoff et al., 2009; Bryc et al., 2010; Hodgson et al., 2014a ). We describe these patterns by measuring gene-flow between populations and relate them to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa

. Admixture occurs when genetically differentiated ancestral groups come together and mix, a process which is increasingly regarded as a common feature of human populations across the globe ( Patterson et al., 2012; Hellenthal et al., 2014; Busby et al., 2015 ). Genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent’s history and its impact on genetic diversity

. These patterns of coancestry provide evidence of widespread sharing of haplotypes within and between ancestry regions. To quantify population structure, we used two metrics to measure the difference between each of the 48 African and 12 Eurasian groups. First, we used the classical measure FST ( Hudson et al., 1992; Bhatia et al., 2013 ) which measures the differentiation in SNP allele frequencies between two groups

. Understanding the extent to which individuals share haplotypes ( which we call coancestry ), rather than independent markers, can provide a rich description of ancestral relationships and population history ( Lawson et al., 2012; Leslie et al., 2015 ). For each group we use the latest analytical tools to characterise the populations as mixtures of haplotypes and provide estimates for the date of admixture events ( Lawson et al., 2012; Hellenthal et al., 2014; Leslie et al

. Alternatively, higher proportions of ancestry from Southern or Eastern Niger-Congo speakers are the result of subsequent indirect gene-flow through these groups, which we use together with the time of admixture to relate to the Bantu expansion. We note that our interpretation may change with future analyses involving populations from the relatively under-sampled central southern Africa

. Moreover, our analysis – in addition to evidence from linguistic phylogenetics ( Currie et al., 2013; Grollemund et al., 2015 ) – provides genetic support for the late-split hypothesis, suggesting that the agriculturist Bantus migrated south around the Congo rainforest before travelling east. Our haplotype-based analyses support a complex picture of recent historical gene-flow in Africa ( Figure 6 )

. the Ju/’hoansi ), several groups from the East Africa ( Sudanese, Ari, and Somali groups ), and the Fulani and Jola from The Gambia. Using the results of the PCA and fineSTRUCTURE analyses together with ethno-linguistic classifications and geography, we defined seven groups of populations within Africa ( Supplementary file 1 ), which we refer to as ancestry regions ( shown on the left of Figure 1D ) when describing gene-flow across Africa

. These results suggest that for some groups, haplotype similarity to other ancestries can vary more substantially than allele frequencies alone. In designing genotyping and sequencing studies these differences can be important in ensuring that the breadth of variation in African populations is adequately covered ( Kwiatkowski, 2005; Gurdasani et al., 2014 ). Africa has an exciting and important role in furthering understanding of human biology and disease

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 15266. 025 In general, we find that groups from similar ancestry regions tend to have inferred admixture events at similar times and involving similar sources ( Figure 3 ), which suggests that genetic variation has been shaped by shared historical events. For every event, the curves with the greatest amplitudes involved a population from a ( usually non-Khoesan ) African ancestry region on one side, and either a Eurasian or Khoesan population on the other

. We then apply statistical approaches to phasing genotypes to obtain haplotypes for each individual, and use previously published methods to represent the haplotypes that an individual carries as a mosaic of other haplotypes in the sample ( so-called chromosome painting [Li and Stephens, 2003] ). We present a detailed picture of haplotype sharing across sub-Saharan Africa using a model-based clustering approach that groups individuals using haplotype information alone

. We observed a large amount of shared LD at short genetic distances between different African populations ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). Such patterns may result from population genetic processes other than admixture, such as shared demographic history and population bottlenecks ( Loh et al., 2013 )

. The mixture model approach is useful for describing coancestry between populations which can result from both admixture and shared evolutionary history. 10. 7554/eLife. 15266. 026Figure 4. Inference of admixture in sub-Saharan African using GLOBETROTTER. ( A ) For each group we show the ancestry region identity of the best matching source for the first and, if applicable, second events

. Moreover, given uncertainty in the dating of admixture when using different maps and MALDER parameters, these results should be taken as a guide to the general structure of genetics relationships between African groups, rather than a precise description of the gene-flow events. Chromosome painting analysis provides an alternative approach to inferring admixture events which directly uses the similarity in haplotypes ( combination of alleles ) between pairs of individuals

. Although the proportions of admixture from these minor sources differ, the major sources of admixture in East African Niger-Congo speakers are similar, containing a mix of Southern Niger-Congo ( Malawi ), Central West African, Afroasiatic, and Nilo-Saharan ancestries. These events may be an indirect route for European-like gene-flow into East Africa

. The remaining 23 groups are from publicly available datasets from a further eight sub-Saharan African countries ( Pagani et al., 2012; Schlebusch et al., 2012; Petersen et al., 2013 ) and the 1000 Genomes Project ( 1KGP ), with Eurasian groups from the latter included to help understand the genetic contribution from outside of the continent ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

. Secondly, when ancient events are identified with MALDER, such as in the Mossi from Burkina Faso, where we estimate admixture around 5000 years ago between a Eurasian ( GBR ) and a Khoesan speaking group ( /Gui //Gana ), we know that modern haplotypes are likely to only be an approximation of ancestral diversity ( Pickrell and Reich, 2014 )

., 2014 ) ; and a novel signal of ancient ( >7. 5 ky ) Eurasian admixture in the Yoruba of Central West Africa ( Gurdasani et al., 2014 ). Comparisons of contemporary sub-Saharan African populations with the first ancient genome from within Africa, a Neanderthal ( Pagani et al,2012 ) show that Eurasian admixture has been present in the continent for at least 7, 000 years. Our results are consistent with these findings and suggest that Eurasian admixture has been present in sub-Saharan Africa for at least 7, 000 years.

    Title: Mitotic spindle scaling during Xenopus development by kif2a and importin α
    Abstract: Early development of many animals is characterized by rapid cleavages that dramatically decrease cell size, but how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions is not understood. To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 ( 4 cells, 37 µm ) and stage 8 ( ∼4000 cells, 18 µm ). We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization.

    Supporting Text:
    Reconstituting spindle formation in embryo extracts enabled us to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size during X. laevis development through differential activation of the kinesin-13 kif2a. While a number of perturbations have been shown to alter spindle size, we have identified, out the hundreds of known spindle associated proteins, physiological effectors that operate to scale the spindle during embryogenesis

. Taking advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle size without functionally perturbing the spindle allowed us to uncover an important role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early Xenopus development. This work suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.

. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development and suggests that the physical changes in embryonic cells size can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture ( Courtois et al., 2012 ). In egg extracts, importin α phosphorylation is thought to liberate it from membrane stores into the cytoplasm, thereby promoting its transport activity ( Hachet et al., 2004 )

. Correcting for nonspecific binding and utilizing kif2a ΔNLS as control, we found that kif2a could retrieve ∼10 times more importin α from stage 3 extracts than from stage 8 extracts. This result suggests that the amount of importin α partitioning to membrane is sufficient to alter its interaction with kif2a ( Figure 6C, D ). The identification of a mechanism contributing to spindle size control in embryos enabled us to test its functional significance during development

., 2012 ). Collectively, these observations suggest that changes in gradients and spindle assembly pathways are likely to accompany cell size changes and could influence spindle size. To address how spindle size is determined during vertebrate embryogenesis, we created an embryo extract system capable of assembling spindles in cytoplasmic extracts at any stage of X. laevis development up to the midblastula transition when cell divisions become asynchronous ( Newport and Kirschner, 1982 )

. Altogether, these data indicate that spindle length, which is controlled by regulation of MT-destabilizing activities within the spindle, impacts metaphase spindle orientation in the very large cells of the Xenopus embryo, but additional mechanisms operate to ensure properly positioned cleavage divisions. 10. 7554/eLife. 00290. 019Figure 7. Metaphase spindle orientation in stage 3 embryos depends on spindle size

. However, the mechanisms coordinating cell and spindle size are poorly understood, and the functional consequences of altering these mechanisms during vertebrate development are unknown. Embryogenesis of the frog Xenopus laevis typifies the developmental scaling problem, and both cell and spindle sizes have been measured ( Wuhr et al., 2008 ). Following fertilization, the ∼1

. Finally, one-cell embryos injected with importin α mRNA for overexpression led to a ∼20% increase in spindle length at stage 8, indicating that the interplay between importin α and kif2a can occur in developing embryos ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 00290. 016Figure 5. Regulation of kif2a by importin α scales spindles size. ( A ) Addition of recombinant kif2a to stage 3 extracts decreases spindle size in a dose-dependent manner

. Regulation of spindle assembly factors by nuclear transport proteins is central to the chromatin-mediated spindle assembly pathway in meiosis and at stage 3 ( Figure 2B ), but cytoplasmic levels of importin α decrease by almost 50% at stage 8, a change that affects nuclear size during development ( Levy and Heald, 2010 ), raising the possibility that importin α could impact spindle MT dynamics if it were able to regulate kif2a recruitment and activity

. At the end of the four-cell stage ( stage 3 ), the X. laevis embryo undergoes a synchronous asymmetric division with spindles aligned along the animal–vegetal axis, but displaced toward the animal pole to generate an eight-cell embryo ( stage 4 ) containing four smaller and four larger cells. By microinjecting recombinant kif2a just prior to this division, we could specifically alter spindle size and assess both chromosome segregation and spindle orientation defects

., 2011 ). In contrast to interspecies spindle scaling, which relied on a regulatory phosphorylation site, the developmental mechanism described here depends on decreasing cytoplasmic levels of an inhibitor, importin α, which may be directly linked to changes in the ratio of surface membrane to cell volume ( Figure 7D )

To investigate how spindle size scales with cell size during development, we established a spindle reconstitution system utilizing cytoplasmic extracts from X. laevis embryos at different embryonic stages. This system is analogous to the cytostatic factor ( CSF ) arrested meiosis II extract derived from unfertilized X. laevis eggs, which has facilitated fundamental discoveries pertaining to the cell cycle and spindle assembly ( Maresca and Heald, 2006 )

. While the RanGTP gradient is known to act through activation of MT stabilizers and motor proteins, we have identified kif2a as the first MT-destabilizing protein that could be regulated by this pathway ( Walczak and Heald, 2008 ). Consistent with a role for kif2a in spindle size control, either increasing its levels or disrupting its localization by inhibiting dynein can modulate meiotic spindle size in Xenopus egg extracts ( Gaetz and Kapoor, 2004; Ohi et al., 2007 )

. By identifying a physiological mechanism that controls spindle size and then altering it, we have identified a role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in very large cells of the early X. laevis embryo. However, chromosome segregation was robust to decreases in spindle size indicating that spindle architecture remained viable and a large spindle is not essential for division of large cells

. The single bands present stage 3 and stage 5 embryos convert to multiple bands in stage 7 and stage 8 embryos ( Figure 6A ) coincident with the initiation of spindle scaling. By examining different fractions generated by the crushing centrifugation of embryos during extract preparation, we identified a slower-migrating species of importin α enriched in the lipid/membrane fraction at stage 8, thereby decreasing importin α levels in the cytoplasmic fraction

. Importantly, this mechanism functions cell autonomously and independent of developmental stage, thereby assuring that the spindle scales correctly over the range of cell sizes present in the embryo at each cleavage division. It is important to note that neither the interspecies nor developmental scaling mechanisms identified fully account for spindle size differences. Future research will tell whether many factors are involved and if there are other common themes

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00290. 017 Since the ratio of kif2a to importin α was critical for developmental spindle scaling, we investigated in more detail the mechanisms regulating importin α levels

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00290. 015 To investigate whether the balance of kif2a and importin α could influence spindle size during development, we altered the levels of each protein in embryo extracts. Increasing the concentration of kif2a in stage 3 extracts decreased spindle size in a dose-dependent manner up to ∼22% ( Figure 5A )

. We have shown that developmental spindle scaling is coincident with a change in spindle assembly pathway from a chromatin-mediated mechanism to a centrosome-dominated mechanism. In egg extracts and large blastomeres, importin α binds to cargo proteins and provides, in combination with importin β, functional regulation downstream of the RanGTP gradient ( Nachury et al., 2001; Wiese et al., 2001 )

Title: Mitotic spindle scaling during Xenopus development by k2 and import α

Summary:

The development of many animals is characterized by rapid cleavages that decrease cell size, but how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing dimensions is not understood. To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during Xenopus lavis embryogenesis, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasm extracts from embryos that recapitulates in vivo size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µ) and stage 8 (∼400 cells,18µ). We identified kines-13 k2 as a driver of spindle whose microtub-destabilizing activity is inhibited stage 3 sples by transport import α, and activated stage 8 when import α partitions a pool. Altering spindle in embryos impaired orientation during metaph, but segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle in Xenopus is coupled cell size through rati mechanism controlling microub destabilization.

In this study, we reconstituted spindle in embryo extracts to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle with size during X. lavis development through activation the kines-13 k2. While number perturbations have shown alter spindle size, we identified the hundreds of spindle associated proteins physiological effectors that operate to scale during embryogenesis. Advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle without perturbing spindle allowed us to uncover a role for spindle in maintaining orientation in large cells early Xenopus. This suggests the physical features of cell drive intracellular scaling through biochemical redistribution and steady-state activities. This is consistent with gradual from meiotic to mitotic morphology observed early development and suggests changes embryonic size impact biochemical alter architecture (Couris et al., 2012). In extracts, import α phosphorylation liberates from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting activity (Het al 2004). Correcting nonspecific and k2N as control, we found k2 retrieve ∼ times import α stage 3 than stage 8. This suggests import α partition to membrane sufficient alter interaction k2 (Figure 6, D). Identification mechanism contributing spindle control enabled us test significance during development. Collectively these suggest changes spindle pathways accompany size and influence size. To determine size vertebrate, we created system capable assembling sples cytoplasm extracts any stage X. lavis up midula when divisions asynchronous (Newport and Kirsch 1982). These indicate spindle length controlled regulation MT-destabil activities impacts metaph orientation large Xen, additional operate ensure divisions.

    Title: Tandem riboswitches form a natural Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria
    Abstract: Gene control systems sometimes interpret multiple signals to set the expression levels of the genes they regulate. In rare instances, ligand-binding riboswitch aptamers form tandem arrangements to approximate the function of specific two-input Boolean logic gates. Here, we report the discovery of riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) that naturally exist either in singlet arrangements, or occur in tandem with guanine aptamers. Tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind the target ligands, either independently or in combination, to approximate the function expected for an IMPLY Boolean logic gate to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. The existence of sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems that sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives to control synthesis of RNA molecules supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors.

   ., 2003 ) or PRPP ( Figure 2B ) aptamers. Only the aptamer regions of the RNA were examined by these in-line probing experiments, but the logic gate function of the tandem riboswitch is accomplished through interactions between the two aptamers and the adjoining expression platform. Consequently, terminator and antiterminator stems are stabilized or destabilized depending on the relative concentrations of both guanine and PRPP

. While tandem riboswitch systems have previously been described ( Figure 6 ), the guanine-PRPP system is the only example of two tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities that share the same expression platform, allowing for a new type of logic function to be implemented

. All of these RNA systems demonstrate complex chemical sensing and regulatory functions, which perhaps reflects the complexity of systems used for metabolite monitoring and biological regulation in ancient RNA World organisms. Furthermore, it seems likely that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates will be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells.

If PRPP was used by RNA World organisms to generate the building blocks of this major biopolymer, then RNA aptamers that selectively bound this biosynthetic precursor in ancient times might have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells. Intriguingly, we had representatives of PRPP riboswitches on our list of riboswitch candidates over a decade ago ( Barrick et al., 2004 ), but due to their striking similarity to riboswitches for guanidine ( Nelson et al

. Furthermore, the discovery of tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitches serve as additional demonstrations of how complex molecular devices can be formed purely from RNA. We should note here that the in vitro transcription data for the logic gate molecules ( Figure 5B, C ) represent the combined output of a population of RNA transcripts

. Thus, the tandem riboswitch arrangement permits cells to tune the expression levels of associated genes based on the relative concentrations of guanine and PRPP, such that high PRPP levels promote purine production despite the abundance of guanine, a prominent purine. At the single molecule level, each riboswitch aptamer in this tandem construct favors either transcription termination or elongation based on the binding of its cognate ligand

. In this regard, each RNA molecule carrying this tandem aptamer arrangement functions as a Boolean IMPLY logic gate. The truth table for an IMPLY logic gate ( Figure 6A ) indicates that gene expression should be on when neither ligand is present, and when PRPP is bound by the RNA – even when guanine is available. Finally, gene expression should be off when guanine is bound by the RNA, which should occur when guanine is abundant while PRPP is not

. To evaluate the proposed two-input logic gate function, the same guanine-PRPP tandem aptamer system including its associated expression platform from B. megaterium ( Figure 5A ) was subjected to in vitro transcription termination assays. Consistent with results from the singlet aptamer, the addition of PRPP increases the fraction of RNA transcripts that pass beyond the intrinsic terminator stem and reach full length ( Figure 5B )

. Each tandem riboswitch aptamer transcript is either terminated ( OFF ) or fully transcribed ( ON ), but the band intensities from analytical gel electrophoresis report on the results of the population of transcripts. The outputs of the riboswitch logic gate can be further complicated by at least two issues. First, an individual transcript might fail to function properly, say by misfolding of an aptamer domain, such that it cannot respond to the presence of a ligand

. Similarly, the tandem riboswitch-ribozyme arrangement formed by a c-di-GMP-II riboswitch and a group I self-splicing ribozyme senses both c-di-GMP and guanosine ( or any of its 5´-phosphorylated derivatives ) to approximate the function of a Boolean AND gate ( Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011 ). In this example, one chemical input is sensed by a conventional riboswitch aptamer, whereas the second chemical input is sensed by the active site of a ribozyme

. This method takes advantage of the inherent chemical instability of phosphodiester linkages in unstructured regions of an RNA and the folding differences in aptamers brought about by ligand binding to provide details on riboswitch function. The 106 purC RNA construct exhibits structural modulation at highly conserved nucleotide positions upon the addition of PRPP ( Figure 2B )

. This all-RNA system joins the NOR gate formed by tandem S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) and adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl or coenzyme B12 ) riboswitches ( Sudarsan et al., 2006 ) ( Figure 6B ) and the AND gate formed by tandem T box and ppGpp riboswitch RNAs ( Figure 6C ) as sophisticated regulatory RNAs that approximate Boolean logic functions

. The physical arrangement of each aptamer in the tandem arrangement suggests that they share a single expression platform. Guanine binding to its aptamer likely would promote the formation of an adjoining intrinsic transcription terminator stem, which would halt transcription. In opposition, binding of ligand to the adjacent subtype 2b RNA would preclude terminator stem formation and thereby override the typical function of the guanine riboswitch

. This occupancy distribution will be reflected in the transcriptional output of the RNA population, but each individual transcript still yields a binary output ( terminated or full-length product ) that is biased by the concentrations of ligands present. The IMPLY gate described herein involves a riboswitch RNA with aptamers for the RNA nucleobase guanine and the RNA precursor PRPP

. This regulatory pattern could be accomplished by the tandem RNA arrangement through formation of an antiterminator stem by alternative base pairing interactions between the two aptamers, similar to those observed for an allosterically-regulated tandem riboswitch-ribozyme described previously ( Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011 ). Alternatively, as noted earlier, the aptamers might compete sterically due to the proximity of their conserved sequences and structures

. Regardless of the precise mechanism, we hypothesize that an unoccupied PRPP aptamer permits formation of the terminator stem, whereas an occupied guanine aptamer destabilizes the PRPP aptamer. Additional detailed kinetic and structural studies will be necessary to reveal the precise molecular interactions that yield IMPLY gene control logic

. Such tandem arrangements are likely to function in concert as two-input molecular logic gates ( ; Stoddard and Batey, 2006; Lee et al., 2010 ). Guanine riboswitches typically turn off expression of downstream purine biosynthesis genes when sufficient guanine is present ( Mandal et al., 2003 ), while representatives of ykkC subtype 2b riboswitches were predicted to turn on expression of downstream genes

Most experimentally validated riboswitch classes sense and respond to ligands originating from RNA metabolism pathways, and therefore it seemed reasonable to consider the likelihood that riboswitches for PRPP would exist. PRPP is an essential precursor for the modern biosynthesis of RNA monomers in organisms from all three domains of life, and is likely to have been important for the production of ribonucleotides very early in evolution

. Specifically, there are typically only 5 to 7 nucleotides separating the P1 stems of the guanine and PRPP aptamers, suggesting this juxtaposition is important for logic gate function. Second, the addition of PRPP to the tandem construct causes a reduction in spontaneous RNA cleavage within the conserved nucleotides at the 5´ terminus of the PRPP aptamer ( Figure 4B, region 5 ), whereas guanine addition causes this same region to experience a dramatic increase in scission

To evaluate PRPP binding and riboswitch aptamer function, we examined a 106 nucleotide singlet aptamer arbitrarily derived from the purC gene of the bacterium Facklamia ignava ( Figure 2A ) by using in-line probing ( Soukup and Breaker, 1999; Regulski and Breaker, 2008 )

    Provide a **formal summary** of the article in 200-250 words

Scientists have discovered a new type of RNA molecule, called a ribwitch, that can function as a Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria. A Boolean logic gate is a system that can make decisions based on two or more inputs. In this case, the ribwitch can sense two ligands, guanine and phosphoribos pyrophosphate (PR), and turn on or off the expression of genes for purine biosynthesis based on their concentrations. This is the first example of a ribwitch that can sense two different ligands on the same platform, allowing for a new type of logic to be implemented. The discovery supports the idea that ancient RNA organisms could have managed complex metabolism without protein factors.

The ribwitch is a tandem arrangement of two aptamers, one for guanine and PR, that can bind their ligands independently or together. When guanine is present, the PR aptamer is destabilized, allowing transcription to continue. When PR is present, the gu aptamer is stabilized, halting transcription. This is an example of an IMPLY logic gate, where expression is on when neither ligand is present, on when PR is present with guanine, and off when gu is present without PR. The ribwitch was tested in vitro and shown to function as expected.

The discovery of this ribwitch demonstrates that RNA can form complex devices purely from itself. It is likely that additional two-input logic gates will be found in modern cells. The authors suggest that RNA organisms may have used PR to generate building blocks of RNA and that the aptamers that bound this precursor may have persisted as ribwitches in modern cells. The study highlights the complexity of RNA systems used for metabolite monitoring and regulation in ancient organisms.

    Title: The readily-releasable pool dynamically regulates multivesicular release
    Abstract: The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential dictates the reliability of synaptic transmission. Variability of this fundamental property provides diversity of synaptic function across brain regions, but the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single ( univesicular release, UVR ) or multiple vesicles ( multivesicular release, MVR ) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, a notion that is well-supported by the calcium-dependence of release mode. However, using mouse brain slices, we now demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle release probability. Our results point to a model wherein protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. Together these findings define molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

    Supporting Text:
   . Diversity in Ca2+ homeostasis, ACs and PKA may thus contribute to the variability in PKA and synapsin-dependent regulation of release across synapses. Recent release models have proposed that vesicles transition between sequential states: from loose to tighter tethering with release machinery followed by Ca2+-triggered fusion ( Neher and Brose, 2018 ), which may be akin to transitions from replacement sites to docking sites prior to fusion ( Miki et al., 2016 )

., 1998 ). MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and it appears to be the dominant release mode in human cortex ( Rudolph et al., 2015; Molnár et al., 2016 ). Yet some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, termed univesicular release ( UVR; Korn et al., 1981; Stevens and Wang, 1995; Silver, 2003; Biró et al., 2005 ) and other synapses switch release modes in an activity-dependent manner ( Bender et al., 2009; Higley et al., 2009; Pulido et al

., 2009; Higley et al., 2009; Pulido et al., 2015 ). Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether an active zone supports UVR or MVR is important to understand synaptic diversity as well as to develop unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters. The number of vesicles released from an active zone is the product of vesicle release probability ( Pr ) and the number of vesicles available for release

. The simplest explanation for our results is that the RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, that is under the control of synapsins, and constrains the number of vesicles released ( MVR ). Surprisingly, this fundamental synaptic parameter has not been explored, leading to the exclusive focus on Pr as the principal regulator of UVR ⇔ MVR ( reviewed in Rudolph et al., 2015 )

. However, some high Pr ( 0. 8–0. 9 ) synapses display exclusively UVR ( Silver, 2003; Murphy et al., 2004 ), whereas some low Pr ( 0. 13–0. 33 ) synapses can exhibit MVR ( Oertner et al., 2002; Taschenberger et al., 2002; Foster et al., 2005; Christie and Jahr, 2006 ). This illustrates that Pr alone is insufficient to dictate vesicle release mode, pointing to the potential contribution of vesicle availability

. Our results support a model wherein the release mode is controlled by release site occupancy upstream of Pr, potentially explaining the paradoxical reports of MVR in conditions of high and low Pr. By dissociating the requirement of high Pr from MVR, these results provide new insight into molecular mechanisms that control MVR and illustrate how diverse modes of synaptic transmission can arise from common signaling pathways.

. To overcome the constraints and assumptions of anatomical measures, we indirectly measured the synaptic cleft glutamate concentration as a proxy for the number of vesicles released per active zone while separately measuring Pr and the RRP. We find that cyclic AMP-dependent ( cAMP ) protein kinase A ( PKA ), a canonical pathway that induces various forms of presynaptic plasticity and increases MVR ( Huang et al., 1994; Salin et al., 1996; Chen and Regehr, 1997; Moulder et al

Excitatory glutamatergic synapses mediate the majority of fast communication between neurons in the brain. While general mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission are well-conserved, there is robust diversity in the synaptic parameters that dictate the reliability and temporal fidelity of transmission between brain regions and species ( Nusser, 2018 ). One fundamental parameter that controls synaptic efficacy is the number of vesicles released in response to an action potential

. Thus, suppression of MVR by PKA inhibition was absent in synapsin TKO mice. Altogether these data suggest that synapsins may be the principal targets of PKA at CF synapses and that this family of proteins is required for bidirectional regulation of MVR via regulation of the RRP. Our results show PKA-dependent regulation of the RRP bidirectionally transforms the release mode at CF synapses ( UVR ⇔ MVR ) without affecting Pr

., 1991; Hilfiker et al., 2001 ), we focused on regulation of neurotransmitter release by PKA-synapsin with the caveat that other kinases may also act similarly ( i. e. Llinás et al., 1991 ). Interestingly, we found that cAMP/PKA stimulation increased release only under low extracellular Ca2+ whereas, the effects of cAMP/PKA activation were occluded in elevated Ca2+

. Among the many presynaptic proteins that can be directly or indirectly regulated by PKA ( Sudhof, 2004 ), the A-domain of synapsin is an excellent PKA substrate that is well-known to regulate transmitter release ( Hosaka et al., 1999; Hilfiker et al., 2005 ). Synapsins are the most abundant family of synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins and are encoded by three distinct genes ( synapsin I, II, III )

. At each presynaptic bouton that contains a single anatomically-defined active zone, it was originally surmised that at most, one neurotransmitter-filled vesicle can be released ( Redman, 1990 ). Although the one-site-one-vesicle hypothesis was well accepted for decades, a wealth of evidence now demonstrates that multiple vesicles can be released from a given active zone, a process termed multivesicular release ( MVR; Tong and Jahr, 1994; Auger et al., 1998 )

. Our results support these models, assuming that molecules such as synapsins contribute to the molecular machinery upstream of these transitions, since PKA-dependent synapsin signaling changes the size of the RRP without affecting the probability of Ca2+-triggered fusion. Recently, synapsin was proposed to form a distinct liquid phase that captures synaptic vesicles and is rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by CamKII ( Milovanovic et al., 2018 )

We studied regulation of neurotransmitter release at the climbing fiber ( CF ) to Purkinje cell ( PC ) synapse using 0. 5 mM extracellular Ca2+ that constrains transmission to the release of zero or one vesicle with each action potential ( UVR ). As in other synapses, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin ( fsk; Figure 1A left ) potentiated neurotransmitter release as measured by ~33% increase in the peak amplitude of EPSCs ( Salin et al

., 2016 ). PF axons rarely form multiple contacts with an individual postsynaptic cell ( Napper and Harvey, 1988 ) and the maximum number of released vesicles indicates the presence of several docking sites, ranging between 2 and 10 ( Malagon et al., 2016; Pulido and Marty, 2017 ). Assessing synaptic responses to train stimulation of single PF synapses revealed a diversity of UVR or MVR across a large range of Prs ( Nahir and Jahr, 2013; Malagon et al., 2016 )

. To fully explore the limits of this regulation, we systematically varied the number of vesicles released per synapse by changing extracellular [Ca2+] and measured how blocking PKA activity affects KYN inhibition of EPSCs. As shown in Figure 4D, KYN inhibition was well described by a curve with a minimum as extracellular Ca2+ was increased, presumably reflecting maximal MVR and elevated synaptic glutamate concentration

., 2016 ). For simplicity, the size of the RRP is shown to be dependent on synapsin that may also function to assist in the priming of already-docked vesicles ( Figure 7A ). In our scheme, the phosphorylation state of synapsin is critical to controlling the probability of site occupancy and the RRP size upstream from the probability that a competent vesicle will be released.

    Title: Reconstitution of selective HIV-1 RNA packaging in vitro by membrane-bound Gag assemblies
    Abstract: HIV-1 Gag selects and packages a dimeric, unspliced viral RNA in the context of a large excess of cytosolic human RNAs. As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5’ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another.

    Supporting Text:
   . We hypothesize that a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA. In summary, our study leads to a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA ( Figure 7 )

., 2016 ). It was reported that the large majority of plasma membrane-proximal genomic HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag. In cells expressing Gag, monomeric genomic RNAs are seen to coalesce to dimers on the membrane, but were not observed to arrive to the membrane as dimers. That study and our results underscore the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging

. Existing structural and biochemical data are not sufficient to explain how a pool of cytosolic Gag, binding mainly cellular RNA, assembles into virus particles which package dimeric viral genomes with 90% probability. Here, we have reconstituted the selective genome packaging of HIV-1 in a minimal system using giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ), recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag and purified RNAs

. Lattice contacts conferring Gag ability to multimerize on a membrane are crucial for the selective packaging of viral RNA. The 5’UTR is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without any gross changes to its secondary structure. Moreover, the association of Gag with tRNA serves to inhibit genome-less virus assembly. 10. 7554/eLife. 14663. 013Figure 7. A model for selective HIV-1 genome packaging

. Gag assembling on GUV membranes selectively packages the HIV-1 5’UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We find that the RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations that subtly affect its ability to cluster on a membrane

., 2014 ). Our reconstituted system allowed us to disentangle the effect that different RNAs have on Gag membrane association ( Figure 6 ). We show that Gag-tRNA interactions may also serve to increase Gag fidelity for viral RNA. In the absence of tRNA, any long RNA caused a slight increase in Gag membrane association. But in the presence of 20 µM tRNA, 5’UTR and a longer 1947 nt fragment of the HIV-1 genome increased Gag membrane association more than other RNAs

Here, we used biochemical reconstitution methods to show that a minimal system consisting of the HIV-1 Gag protein, the HIV-1 5’UTR, and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-containing GUVs is capable of selective RNA packaging in the presence of an excess of non-specific RNA. We find a strong correlation between the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane and its selective packaging of viral RNA

. Next, long viral or unspecific RNAs at 5 nM concentration were added to Gag with or without tRNA. In addition to the above studied 5’UTR, RRE, and RNA378, an RNA corresponding to the first 1947 nucleotides of the HIV-1 strain NL4-3 genomic RNA was studied ( HIV1947 ), along with a single-stranded control RNA of similar length ( RNA2266 ). In the absence of tRNA, all these RNAs slightly increased the amount of Gag associated with vesicles ( Figure 6d )

., 2014 ). Several reports have shown that RNA binding to the basic patch on the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag can compete with its ability to bind acidic phospholipids such as PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( Alfadhli et al., 2009, 2011; Chukkapalli et al., 2010, 2013; Dick et al., 2013; Dick and Vogt, 2014 ). We wanted to investigate whether Gag-tRNA interactions also play a role in selective RNA packaging

. A model for selective HIV-1 genome packaging. Cytosolic Gag ( light gray triangles ) is inhibited from membrane association by its association with tRNA ( yellow ). Gag ( triangles and hexagons, colored dark gray where forming specific contacts with the packaging signal ) binding viral genomic RNA ( red; thick portions correspond to the 5’UTR, thin portions to the remainder, not shown to scale ) has a higher probability to overcome this inhibition and associate with the plasma membrane

. We reasoned that this system could also be used to study the RNA selection of an assembling HIV-1 virus. The 5’ untranslated region ( 5’UTR ) and the Rev-responsive element ( RRE ) of the HIV-1 genome ( nucleotides 1–345 and 7259–7612, of the genomic RNA of HIV-1 strain NL4-3 and ARV-2/SF2, respectively ), along with a nominally unstructured 378 nt single-stranded control RNA ( RNA378 ), were produced by in vitro transcription

Packaging the correct genetic material is a key event in the assembly of an infectious virus. In the case of HIV-1, both the recognition of the genomic RNA, its targeting to the plasma membrane, and assembly of a membrane-enveloped virus around it is carried out by the viral protein Gag ( Rein et al., 2011; Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012; Freed, 2015 )

. This was observed both with the shorter 345 nt 5’UTR, which has been reported to be locked in a dimer-favoring conformation, and the longer 356 nt 5’UTR which is also capable of assuming a second conformation ( Lu et al., 2011a; Heng et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). In the light of a recent report that most genomic HIV-1 RNAs in cells are monomeric until interacting with Gag on a membrane ( Chen et al

. The nucleocapsid ( NC ) domain of Gag has two zinc knuckle motifs which together with adjacent residues interact with the viral RNA ( Berkowitz et al., 1993; Lu et al., 2011b ). Mutations in NC that interfere with RNA binding lead to formation of non-infectious viruses ( Aldovini and Young, 1990; Gorelick et al., 1990 ). Transcription of the integrated HIV-1 provirus results in both spliced and unspliced transcripts, coding for different viral proteins ( Coffin et al., 1997 )

., 1998; Accola et al., 2000 ). Live-cell fluorescence microscopy has delivered important constraints on the stoichiometry and the location of the RNA selection event. Genomic RNA is present at the onset of HIV-1 assembly at the plasma membrane, at which point the number of Gag molecules was reported to be below the detection limit of ~12 molecules ( Jouvenet et al., 2009 ). Cytosolic Gag does not form large oligomers ( Robinson et al., 2014; Hendrix et al

We previously reported an in vitro reconstitution of HIV-1 assembly using recombinant myristoylated Gag protein and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-containing giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Carlson and Hurley, 2012 ). We showed that GUV-bound Gag clusters mimic the behavior of cellular HIV-1 budding sites in their lipid requirements for assembly, nucleic acid- and ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) protein binding

. In the presence of 20 µM tRNA however, the 5’UTR and the longer HIV1947 RNA ( which contains the 5’UTR sequence ) enhanced membrane association by Gag more than the other RNAs ( Figure 6e ). RNA378 had no effect on Gag membrane association in the presence of 20 µM tRNA, whereas the effect of RRE or the longer RNA on G association was similar to that of the 5UT and HIV7 ( Figure 6 )
