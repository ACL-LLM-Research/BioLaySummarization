Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the spread of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT), a parasitic disease that can cause severe illness and death if left untreated, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The model was fitted to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province, a region with a high burden of the disease. The stochastic model, which accounts for uncertainty, was able to capture the dynamics of AT observed at the health level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic AT model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for better quantification of results. The analysis used a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology to fit the model to the data. Spatial heterogeneity in cases was reflected in the results, predicting that under current strategies, the area Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will be the last to achieve elimination. The deterministic version of the model, fitted with MCM, had faster computation times but virtually indistinguishable parameterisation. The authors suggest expanding area fitting to more of RC should be done with deterministic for efficiency, with stochastic used to capture parameter and variation in reporting and elimination estimations. The study demonstrates a mechanistic stochastic model can be fitted to health data in RC, providing a framework for detailed projections of future infections under intervention scenarios.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) using spatial functions and random forest models to predict patient outcomes and identify important spatial relationships. The method controls false discovery rate and is resistant to overfitting. It was evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying spatial patterns with known interactions. The approach was applied to triple-negative breast cancer and lung cancer data from multiplex ion imaging. For TNBC, two groups were separated into "compartmentalized" and "mixed" based on tumor-immune cell interactions. The method produced functions for cell-cell interactions, reduced dimensions using principal components, and combined with patient data to predict outcomes. A random forest model was used to identify important interactions.

The method was applied to lung cancer data, comparing squamous and adenocarcinomas, and identified differences in cell relationships. It was also applied to TNBC, identifying clusters and important interactions. The approach overcomes challenges in distinguishing meaningful interactions among many potential interactions, controlling the false rate. It generates easy-to-interpret plots and has high power even with small samples. A random forest model was used to evaluate the importance of spatial interactions and meta-data in predicting outcomes. The method is the first to evaluate spatial interactions in TME that vary with many potential interactions. Many methods rely on simple summaries or simplify data, such as clustering or a single distance.

The approach uses a combination of spatial statistics, functional analysis, and machine learning to identify useful relationships in TME predicting outcomes. It can be applied to data from various technologies, such as OP, Phenycler, Fusion, Mcope, Xenium, and Cosmx. The power to detect a single interaction decreases with increasing cells. The method was applied to TNBC, identifying clusters and interactions, and lung cancer, detecting differences in relationships.
Researchers computationally studied how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-evolve in particular during desynchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity: spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP) without weight-dependent pruning and ST, combination of ST and h, and combination of ST and structural plasticity that includes h and weight pruning. To accommodate diverse times of neuronal firing, they introduced a stochastic model enabling numerical analyses. From network theory, they revealed structural reorganization remarkably enhances network synchrony. Weaker contacts were preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent, synchrony achieved with sparser connections in ST-only model. Strengthening contacts from neurons with higher firing rates to lower rates and weakening in opposite, followed by removal, allowed synchron with fewer connections. This activity reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. They compared stimulation desynchronization of synchronized states in ST-only with desynchronization models. Latter required higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. Findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive non-invasive modalities inducing lasting relief, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers investigated the regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of flatworm that can regenerate large parts of its nervous system. They found that neurons express a gene delta-2, which interacts with Notch-expressing phagoc progenitors to form glia. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 reduced glia, but not other phocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation, while transplantation of delta-2-express neurons formed gl at ectopic locations. This suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia. The study also explored Notch signaling's role in planarian gl regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal development. Notch is essential for cell fate specification and patterning in metazoans. Neurons regenerate in proper numbers and positions with delta-2 expression, interacting with Notch+ phoc progenitors to form gl. This pathway regulates gl specification and differentiation between mature neurons and unrelated phoc progenitors. Differentiated glia were observed with delta-2-express neurons, supporting interaction between delta- and Notch phoc progenitors for gl differentiation. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and su genes did not affect other phytic cells, but gl were absent in head, eyes, and dorsal regions. The study addresses coordinated regeneration of neurons and gl, a challenge in planarians. Placement of delta-2 neurons in ectopic locations yields access to phoc progen, enabling gl formation. The findings suggest a novel approach integrating gl with neurons in regenerating nervous systems, solving gl specification in numbers and locations using delta-Notch signaling.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in individuals with varying levels of neutralization breadth. They found significant differences in γ T cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutral breadth and those who did not. Activation of γ cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on V1 cells and CD57 on V2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers during acute infection and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD on V1 cells were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. γ T cells may promote neutralization development, which has implications for vaccine strategies.

The study evaluated frequency and phenotype of γ cells from pre-HIV acquisition to acute infection in participants with and without neutral breadth, determining their relationship with viral replication and antibody elicitation. V2 cells were reduced during acute infection and loss associated with viral load. CD on V1 and CD V2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of breadth. The study found associations between γ cell phenotype and breadth, potency, and autologous gp140 Ig at 1 post-HIV, previously associated with development in participants.

The dynamics of γ responses during acute and chronic infection were determined by sorting cells from participants previously identified as broad and non-broad neutralizers. Expression of CD and CD on V cells pre and post-HIV were associated with plasma gp140 Ig at 1 post-HIV. Levels of CD on V cells pre-H and 42 post-H correlated with breadth and potency. Participants with high CD on V cells at set point were more likely to develop breadth. High on V cells at point and αβ at peak were associated with lower odds of breadth.

The study suggests γ cells may promote B engagement following HIV-1 and development of breadth. However, the cohort showed expression was not modulated by HIV and differences were present pre-H for CD and CD on V cells. Infections with CMV and malaria increased these markers on γ cells. The observed differences in CD, CD, CD, and αβ are unique to γ cells. γ can promote humoral responses by stimulating B maturation or T follicular helper cells, bridging innate and adaptive responses. HIV has impact γ cells.
Researchers have developed a computational model of a bispecific antibody, BS1, targeting the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, which are involved in a synergistic pathway that drives metastasis. The model consists of a series of ordinary differential equations for each receptor, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes. To study the IL-6/8 signaling for metastasis inhibition, a novel bispecific antibody, BS, was engineered against IL-6 and IL8. BS contains variable domains of two antibodies: anti-IL6 tocilizum and anti-IL8 10. Simulations of BS binding over a range of antibody concentrations and cells with differing IL-6 and IL-8 expression show that receptor expression is critical for bispecific binding, both total levels and relative amounts of targets. The ratio of IL-6 and IL-8 is crucial for bispecific binding in vitro, leading to differences in monos and bis behavior. Simulations predict optimal antibody concentrations for binding, most stable complex formation at high receptor and intermediate antibody concentrations. The IL-6 and IL-8 are pleotropic factors, receptors expressed on healthy cells and tissues, increasing BS binding to IL-6 even at lower concentrations. Local and global sensitivity analyses of the model show ternary complex and receptor binding to changes in association and dissociation rate constants and antibody concentrations. The model provides insight into mechanisms of bivalent and bis binding, expanding to include additional processes and cell types for more insight. Monos mAbs have limitations, emerging resistance cancer cells mutate. BisAbs demonstrate potential to overcome shortcomings, binding cis. Simulations of BS and combination tocum and 10 over IL-6 and IL-8 expression show total antibody concentration held constant, tocum and 10 in 1:1 ratio. The model clarifies effects domain and expression on inhibition, applicable to particular system and broadly bis design.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved microtub-associated protein, in centrosomal spindle assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. They found that ZYG-8 depletion resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects, and experiments with monopolar spindles revealed excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z-8 was also required for proper microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity was necessary for its function during meiosis and mitosis. The study proposes that Z- plays two roles: 1) regulating microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle, and 2) influencing motors that walk along microtules to tune forces that stabilize the spindle. Z- contains a microtub-binding doubleort domain and kinase, and previous studies showed it is required for spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos. Analysis of astral microule dynamics demonstrated Z- depletion reduced growth rates and increased nucleation, indicating it modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. Z- is also required for assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle, and its kinase activity is necessary for functions in both meiosis and mitosis. The study reveals new roles for Z- in oocytes and insights into how centomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis.
This study investigated the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. Integrating data with large T2 GWAS from the DIANTE meta-analysis through Mendelianization analyses, 79 metabolites were found to have a causal association with T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes including branched amino acids. Using interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis, four metabolites were consistently replicated in an independent dataset from Estonian Biob, with genetic loci in different regions showing attenuated regulation in T2 cases compared to controls. The variants from interaction analysis were QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, pointing towards consequences of T2 on genetic regulation. Through differential analyses, 165 metabolites were associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T2 complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to complications. This work provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and their regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. They crossed a susceptible strain (CC061) with a tolerant strain (CC024) to generate F1 and F2 populations. The F1 and F2 mice were infected with MRSA, and survival rates were 65% and 55, respectively, indicating a complex inheritance pattern for the tolerant phenotype. Colonization in F2 mice was more extreme than their parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection, with the WSB/EJ allele in CC024 contributing to tolerance. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, are receptors for complement C5a, anaphylatoxin, which can trigger a massive immune response. The researchers hypothesize C5 may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing cytokine damage and allowing tolerance to higher pathogen burden and survival. Cytokine and expression differed between strains before and after infection, with three pathways upregulated in CC024. The complement cascade is part of the S aureus infection pathway. Accounting for baseline differences, seven cytokines differed between CC and CC mice post-infection, with IL-10 increased in CC061 and IL-1, IL-4, IL-9, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-27 in CC024. The study suggests genetic factors influencing MR colonization are segregated in F2, with a complex trait controlling interaction. Survival F mice ranged 2-7 days post-infection, with a median 6. Kidney colonization F animals roughly equivalent, irrespective euthan day.
This study investigates how genetic networks influence adaptation during an adaptive walk, focusing on the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of beneficial mutations. Current models of adaptation consider genotype-phenotype relationships, ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. The authors model a trait as the product of a simple gene network, the autoregulatory motif, and use forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive theory is the distribution of fitness of beneficial mutations is exponential. However, both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect alleles than expected. The network model had a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients. This is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Results suggest interactions from genetic networks generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness. 

The study combines biological realism with tools for the evolution of quantitative traits, evaluating the shape of DFE among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks, finding differences from classical expectations in some cases. Understanding genetic influence is an under-explored area, particularly the study of DFE. Both models exhibit similarities in aspects of adaptive walks, the number of steps and distribution effects among fixations beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than additive on average. This was highlighted by a difference in responses to selection, the rate of trait evolution. The study explores a simple network's influence during adaptive scenario, introducing a nonlinear map into adaptive theory. At the foundation of any trait lies a network of genes and regulatory elements controlling expression. Networks can generate epistasis, implications for evolution, recombination, maintenance, and trade-offs between complexity and adaptability.
Researchers propose a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conduct-based neurons and synapses, suggesting they are naturally equipped to optimally integrate information. In this approach, apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. They demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains various findings on single-cell and multi-sens integration, illustrated with simulations. Experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian integration and plasticity are made.

 The biophysics of neurons can be interpreted as Bayesian computations. Conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from Gaussian functions represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior, and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to a target. Before plasticity, specific neuronal dynamics arise from the Bayesian view. Conduct-based integration predicts properties differ from classical models. In absence of input, somatic reflects prior. Dendrites adjust reliability based on past contributing to desired distributions.

 A probabilistic view of single computation shows top-down approach yields same membrane dynamics. Gaussian priors and likelihoods reflect summation of independent inputs yields normal, in agreement with data. Conduct-based integration can be viewed as probabilistic pooling. Each dendrite is an individual with opinion and reliability. Single neurons are equipped with Bay-optimal integration capability. Gradient formulation explains hierarchically organized networks. Inputs from different fields or modalities need to be combined into coherent basis for actions. Bayesian theory provides recipes for optimally solving, but biological implementation unclear.

 The biophysical system computes posterior via evolution. Dendrites represent likelihoods or priors, parametrized by reversal and conduct. Our framework suggests conduct-based coupling enables neurons to perform probabilistic previously thought only at circuit level. Previous studies demonstrated interacting populations perform probabil computations, mechanistic models underlying Bay-opt behavior. Here, probabil may be ingrained in biological, single neurons.
Researchers have classified domains from 48 proteomes in the AlphaFold Database using Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) as a basis for classification. They classified 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprised of 226,424,000 amino residues, with an average classification rate of 90% of residues in proteomes. The study examined populations of homolog groups in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding eukotes have a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, and a higher proportion of repeated proteins, globular and small. They enumerated highly populated domains shared between eukotes and bacteria, such as Rossm domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared sampling of homolog groups from whole proteome against EC reference and stable groups enriched by predictions, discussing implications for future classification strategies for large protein sets. 

The classification of domains from proteomes suggested biological insights for respective organisms, made available on the EC website. The release of AlphaFold led to a flood of protein predictions, prompting examination of domain classification on broad selection of proteomes. The division of models into classified domains, difficult-to-recognize homology, or unstructured regions will continue to be useful for large datasets. The study classified domains from 48 proteomes in AF, including zebraf, flies, and E. coli, with lower classification rate in eukotes due to prediction and contextual errors. The access to previously unclassifiable proteins diminishes gap between structural and sequence classification, illustrating homolog groups enriched by domains and sequence annotations.
Researchers studied the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPy), a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no antivirals, to understand how it replicates in host cells. Using single-cell analysis, they found that BKV requires the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production, contradicting the current model where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into S phase for viral replication. Instead, data supports a new model where BKV requires initial S phase to replicate, aligning with other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. Robust TAg expression was observed in ≥4 cells, suggesting BKV production depends on initial S. To determine if replication relies on initial S, inhibitors were used to prevent cellular replication. BKV is unusual in that DNA is re-replicated and re-replication is required for replication. Canonical licensing and firing mechanisms were required for re-re and displayed activity across the cycle. Findings change understanding of BKV life to include requirement of initial S for robust TAg and viral production. Expression of late genes revealed VP/3 followed robust TAg, suggesting infectious virions formed in replicating cells. Analysis of cell cycle in BKV-infected RP cells showed robust TAg primarily in replicating population, suggesting TAg depends on initial S. Inhibition of origin or firing prior replication decreased titers and T expression. Late inhibition did not decrease titers, showing BKV requires initial S for production. Robust T levels observed in S cells with ≥N content and suppression prior replication decreased BKV production. Data inform revised BKV life, requiring initial S for TAg and replication during host-replication.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene mapping studies with genome-wide association (GW) studies. Most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses examining one gene at a time, but recent developments in TW fine-mapping methods enable joint modeling multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones. Here, we present FAB, a TW fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits capable of modeling genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FAB employs a probit model to link genetically regulated expression (GRe) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account GRe correlation among genes on a chromosome. As a result, FAB controls false discoveries while offering power over existing TWAS fineapping methods. We evaluated FAB through simulations and applied it to six disease traits in the UKBiob dataset, reducing the size of causal sets by 27.9%-36.9% over existing approaches. Leveraging its power, FAB prioritized multiple genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension.
This study investigated the roles of Btn2 and Hsp protein sequeases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation and increase protein misfolding and aggregation. The study found that Btn and Hsp sequeases play a role in triaging proteins formed during oxidative conditions. Hsp appears to protect against aggregation during oxidative stress but its levels remain unchanged during stress, suggesting it may become limiting in Btn Hsp mutants. Data show that Btn and Hsp sequeases are key chaperones required for oxidant tolerance, sequestering misfolded proteins into PQC sites following ROS exposure. Proper sequestration prevents dysfunction and toxicity associated with protein misolding diseases. Btn and Hsp mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a functional role in oxidant tolerance. Data show Btn and H sequeases protect against amorph and amyloid aggregation during oxidative conditions. The study identified Sup35 translation factor as an in vivo sequease substrate and show Btn and H act to suppress oxid-induced formation of the [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup. [PS+] pr formation in sequease mutants does not require insoluble protein localization, but both amorph and amy Sup aggregates are increased in Btn Hsp mutants, suggesting prion formation occurs at multiple sites during oxidative stress. The data identify protein sestration as a key antioxidant mechanism mitigating consequences of protein-induced aggregation.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen to identify non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with glioblastoma (GB) invasion. They found 48 lncRNAs significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion upon knockdown, with the top candidate LINC45 showing an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion. LINC45 expression was associated with patient survival and tumor grade, with higher expression in GBM (grade 4) than LGG (grades 2-3) and higher in LGG compared to normal tissue. Kaplan-Meir survival curves showed patients with higher LINC45 expression had decreased survival. Mechanistic studies suggested LINC45 regulates invasion via WASF, a factor implicated in tumor invasion, with WAS3 KD paralleling invasion loss with LINC45 KD in 2D and 3D invasion models. The study identified LINC45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion, with potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
Researchers used a new clustering procedure to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic process. The goal was to identify the putative model the brain assigns to the sequence of stimuli. The procedure groups EEG signals by their law, employing a dissimilarity measure based on the Kolmogorov-Smir distance. Results indicate the prefrontal cortex uses the occurrence of a strong beat in the sequence to build a model of the sequence. The brain selects a partition of the past of the sequence with four clusters, defined by the last occurrence of the beat. Clustering has two stages: individual, grouping segments of EEG per participant, and a consensus procedure to summarize individual results. Consensus clustering has been used in neuroscience to obtain stable and reliable groupings. The sequence used in the experiment can be characterized by the recurrent occurrence of a strong unit. The brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences and organizes them to classify stimuli and make predictions. A partition of the past with four elements is an economical representation of the sequence. The use of the strong to model the sequence indicates the brain identifies structural aspects to estimate the next event amidst stochasticity.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single resolution, but has limitations. It fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome (total number of transcripts per cell) and dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous tissues. This discrepancy exists between bulk RNA-seq and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF) is proposed. A method to compute and report WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs is introduced, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and WF. WF effectively predict aging progression, implicating diagnostic applications and aging mechanism. The study provides a method to solve sc-se analysis limitations in complex tissues and suggests WF utility and biological significance.

A method to compute WF is developed to offset transcript size and dissoci/processing problem. WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs are calculated and used to illustrate diagnostic and biological utilities. WF are validated by five methods: reconstitution, deolution of whole-se using composite-se data, comparison to experimentally measured transcript contents, independence from cell ratios, and prediction using unmatched-se and-se data. WF show variations among cell types in many organs, uncovering body degree of variations. WF changes indicate aging progression using Tabula Senis atlas, multiple-organ transcript across aging mouse. WF enable accurate representation individual cells in heterogeneous organs by weighting transcript-size variations. WF recapitulate experiment-determined mRNA contents using PB data.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can help identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of analysis. A radial formulation of MVM and adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. RadialM includes removal of outlying SNPs violating M assumptions. AVMR package is presented as software for implementing the methods.

Radial MR and M approaches facilitate assessment of pleotropic associations between genetic and phenotypes using GWAS data. Conducting within radial framework allows outliers to be visualized, M analyses for direct effects multiple exposures estimated. This makes inspection of outliers or comparison challenging. A radial approach allows visualization of effects in M and identification of SN outlying based on association with all exposures. Radial can be used to prune outliers and obtain results not influenced by outlying SN.

Radial plots are useful for highlighting individual SN contribution to heterogeneity respect each exposure. Univar analyses result biased where SN associated multiple causally relevant phenotypes. Rad estimate direct each exposure in single model, exposure heterogeneity and F-statistics test instrument. Pruning remove SN contributed heterogeneity more than expected chance, re-estimated radial model without. Results presented in Table 4. Each exposure univar MR performed, radial including all exposures fit data. Identified SN strongly associated each (p < 5 × 10−8). SN retained linkage disequilibrium threshold R < 0.001, palindic SN removed prior analyses.

Rad estimates each exposure presented Table 1, univar plots Figs A-E S Text. Estimates exhibit bias univar IV. Q-stat evidence heterogeneity each instrument, potential IV assumption violation. Radial can visualize M results, obtain robust estimates identification SN contributing heter M results chance. All analyses performed RM package R environment, facilitating radial analyses.
Researchers recorded the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in featureless arenas on sucroseagar media using the deep learning framework SLE to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion instances. They identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the resulting ethograms to explore the flies' behavior across time and days. The study found daily patterns in stereotyped behaviors, adding information about trends in grooming modalities, probis extension, and locom speed to known about the D melanogaster circadian cycle. The hour after dawn was a unique point in the flies' daily pattern, and the behavioral composition of this hour tracked with other indicators of health such as locom speed and time spent resting. The data and analysis provided a new picture of D melanaster behavior across times, revealing features of unexplored biological mechanisms.

The study found a decline in probis extension and locom speed as time spent in idle increased across days, and the hour after dawn was ethologically unique, tracking the general health of flies. High-resolution data revealed differences in patterns during morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in grooming behavior. Daily patterns were found in measured behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, with a decline in difference between day and night hours as flies weakened and died, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age.
This study identifies novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTP-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-b genetic screen, loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-function in conserved N-related kinases NE-2 (NE8/9) and NE-3 (6/7), which act at the interface of membrane and actin regulation. Proximity studies identified the CDC guanine-nucle exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22. Consistent with this, loss DN- also suppressed ne-associated mol defects. Genetic, localization, and labeling revealed roles for P-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesomes, suggesting P22 plays a role in maintaining structural integrity. Localization and labeling implicated P22 in functions to nucleoplasmic transport and regulation, particularly in the germl, nearly one-third of identified P22 labeling are gran components.
Researchers used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network to study the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostat model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artem resistance. The maps show expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 200 to 202, with the most change between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling spatial support on fine-scale resolution. The study predicts spatio-temp patterns and extents oftem resistance at the subcontinent level, supporting malaria goals in Southeast Asia. 

A geostat model of molecular markers associated with artem resistance was developed, calibrated to the comprehensive dataset from WWARN. Spatio-temp maps of K marker prevalence presented support monitoring drug resistance in Southeast, targeting strategies and elimination efforts. No fine-scale predictive maps exist for artem within Asia; predictive using model-based geistics require large numbers of spatio-temp locations, which is impossible with clinical measures due to expensive and time-consuming nature. Molecular markers associated with resistance were used, with significant data on prevalence. Predictive spatio-temp maps are presented for the changing landscape of artem derivatives in the Greaterong Subregion, providing estimates for locations with no data and used by agencies to prioritise surveillance and policies. 

The study confirmed spatio patterns oftem in Southeast, where elimination by 203 is targeted. Resistance to artem derivatives emerged in Cambodia, detected in the Greater Subregion. P. falcum infections slowed clearance under artem therapies in neighbouring countries, Vietnam and Myanmar. Spatial information on resistance is critical for organisations to prioritise control, but data artem are sparse. The study advances earlier work by predicting K prevalence over the Greater Sub from 200 to 202, illustrating expansion in the last 10 years and increase in east and north Myanmar border States.
This study investigated the autoinhibitory complexes formed by NLR1 and CARD8, two proteins containing the function-to-domain (FI) that undergo autoproteolysis to yield full-length (FL), cleaved-terminal (NT), and cleaved-terminal (CT) peptides. The researchers found that both NLR paralogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions, with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays an essential role in forming NT-CT autohibitory complexes, while the Z5 of rat NLR1 (r1) and CARD mediates NT-CT interaction. Cellular protease dipeptid peptidase 9 (D9) interacts with FL-CT and NT of mLR1, r1, and CARD through Z5 subdomains, forming NT-D9-CT complex. However, D9 cannot bind to NT of hLR1. Functional assays indicated that D9 is involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR1 and CARD, but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. The study enhanced understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscored complexity of interactions in immune response. NLR1 paralogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes, including NT-CT and FLCT, with distinct mechanisms. NT and FL bind CT to restrict inflamome assembly and activation. NLR1 and CARD can be activated by pathogenic proteases through degradation, cleaving NT, leading to degradation of NT and FL, liberating CT for inflome assembly.
This study investigates the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. The results show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), indicating the onset of prote stress in the ER. Mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth under prote stress. The study suggests that increased R1 levels provide cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth. The results demonstrate R1 as a regulator of proteasis in Dophila and its role in competitive survival. R1 is localized to the ER and cis-Gol compartments and loss activates PER-mediated phosphorylation of IF2, consistent with its proposed function as a regulator of ERostasis. Mutations in rer were first identified in yeast, where it was required for proper transport of Secp between ER and Golgi. Loss of R creates prote stress in the wingel, and surrounded by wild-type cells, mutant cells attain the loser fate and are eliminated via competition. The study also investigates R in My-induced overgrowth and R1 levels are upregulated upon My-over.
Researchers investigated the functional impact of 4,887 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. They used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of these variants to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. Among the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous functional data and provide a first functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can be used to predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and applied to other cancer genes. The study used a comprehensive library of CHE2 variants, error-prone PCR, screened en masse for rad complement, and next-generation sequencing to identify complementors in selected yeast. This resulted in testing 4,885 of 4,887 CHE2 SN, including all but one of 3,913 cod changes. Yeast rad complement has been used for protein assessment of several CHE2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants. For example, CHE2 mutation c.110del was tested for complement of yeast53 and no complement was observed. Several studies of CHE2 variants included an "intermediate" category, representing function between wild-type and loss. To see if rad complement score could predict intermediate, looked at 443 variants tested in another assay with intermediate category. Established that results correlate with known pathogenic, used the screen to classify 3,187 amino changes from non-SNVs as "damaging" or "tolerated".
Researchers have discovered a new type II toxin-antitoxin system in Streptococcus pneumoniae, called the Spx1-Ten system, which regulates the orientations of hS inversions in the opacity determinant (od) locus. This system consists of the toxin TenA and antitoxin Spx1, which are co-transcribed as an operon. The balance of the Spx-T system is controlled by the length of the AT-rich region upstream of the sp1A promoter. Overexpression of Ten leads to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S pneumonia, while antitox S1 represses the transcription of the spA-ten operon. Ten binds to the ribosome factor Rim, reducing the level of alternative factor ComX, which activates natural transformation genes. Attenuation of ComX enhances transcription of the invertase Psr, favoring the formation of transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Spontaneous variations in the AT region of the spA promoter generate pneumoc subpopulations with epigen and phenotypic diversity. The Spx-T system is conserved in S pneumonia, with Spx2 sharing 45.9% amino identity with Spx1. Ten promotes the formation of T phase by locking the locus in T-defining configuration, altering the methylome and colony.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions and extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. gcPCA addresses this problem by examining the covariance of datasets to find dimensions that exhibit largest changes between conditions. The method builds on contrast PCA but eliminates the need for a hyperparameter α, which was a limitation. gc uses a normalization to mitigate bias toward high-variance dimensions. The authors provide an open-source toolbox with Python and MATLAB implementations of gc tailored for different scenarios. They demonstrate gc's utility in analyzing high-dimensional data, including unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing. gc is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method for comparing high-dimensional datasets to gain insights into complex biological phenomena.
Researchers developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The model unveiled feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including a negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK. The relevance of the cros was verified in B and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ER and ER target sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells and also modelled B signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling (H-1, OCIL3). The model did not show cellular dependency in the lines studied. Feedback and cros in ER and p38 signaling were conserved across B lymphoma types, suggesting insights may apply to other lymphomas. Three novel connections improved the model: positive c from mTOR to JNK, positive from GSK to ZAP, and negative from p38 to RAF/ME/K. The BL-2 network constitutes a generic structure describing BCR signaling in BL cells.
This study explores the molecular mechanisms of Notch signalling, a pathway essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Notch activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular activation by neighbouring ligands and intracellular inhibition by ligands in the same cell. Different Notch/ligand combinations elicit distinct responses, determining signalling strength, duration, and specificity. The study focuses on DLL4 and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting. Experimental and mathematical approaches reveal two mechanisms: 1) DLL induces Not1 transactivation, 2) J1 blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition through J1/DLL complex formation. A new model of Not signalling recapitulates tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting. The study uncovers a novel role for heteromeric J1/DLL complexes, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. DLL homomers and DLL-J1 heteromers mediate Not1 cis-inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves interplay between Not signalling and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEF) signalling. A new model, DLL/J1-Not signalling is proposed, incorporating DLL/J1-Not-VE signalling. The model recapitulates endothelial fate driven by DLL and J1 in sprouting angiogenesis, highlighting DLL-J1 heterization and affinities for Not1 of DLL and J1 in this process.
Researchers developed Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. They demonstrated DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separated autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. The authors also used DPM to cluster gene expression datasets summarized by gene signatures, introducing a novel procedure for summarizing a signature on a different dataset than where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. They found associations between disease and clusters by DPM, replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering, and presents a method to do so, DPM. Additionally, it presents a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, showing value by summarizing gene expression from patients with IMD using relevant signatures and clustering by DPM. DPM offers advantages in conveying uncertainty about clustering and inferring number of clusters, adapting a standard Dirichlet process model to data with uncertainty. Accounting for uncertainty alters clustering solutions, demonstrated on simulated and real applications. Clustering by similarity has applications in bioinformatics, such as identifying subgroups of disease, inferring gene function, and regulatory relationships, and clustering diseases. Methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in observations, including distance, representative sampling, and adapting likelihood. Uncertainty alters solutions, illustrated on simulated data, with DPM closer to points with lower uncertainty, and methods to empirical mean. DPM shifts data towards cluster, resulting in smaller variance.
Researchers designed artificial image datasets to investigate why deep neural networks fail to use shape features when classifying images, instead relying on color and texture. They trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and combinations, showing that some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent, specifically the alignment of gradients for color and texture features with classes. Reducing this alignment enables networks to learn shape classification. Convolutional networks, except for ResNet50, can learn shape-based classification, indicating the bias is due to learning, not architecture. Training on stylized images and avoiding small crops can increase shape sensitivity but still fails to make networks sensitive to global features. The study suggests that learning algorithms, not architecture, is the limiting factor for convolution networks.
Researchers developed a model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) during liver fibrosis and reversion using the Kappa language, a rule-based modeling approach. The model represents HSC as agents with seven physiological states and interactions with TGF1 molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Simulation studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion, with inactivation allowing elimination of activated HSC during reversion and reactivation of inactivated HSC (iSC) to sustain fibrosis. The model's sensitivity to TGF1 parameters suggests adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions with different levels of T1 production associated with inflammatory response. Experimental data from a mouse model of C4-induced liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease, confirmed by RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis, identifying iSC as novel markers of fibrosis. The study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic liver, exploring the role of iSC in liver homeostasis and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fib in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework for estimating the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases. The method, called MEGA, requires only summary statistics and allows for between-study heterogeneity due to factors like genomic platforms and ethnicity. Simulations showed it is computationally efficient and yields satisfactory results comparable to individual-level data analysis when no heterogeneity is present. MEGA was applied to 5 studies from the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program with 580 participants to estimate the effect of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub. Meta-analysis can be an alternative to individual-level analysis in terms of feasibility and evaluating heterogeneity across factors for diseases and genomic technologies, as shown in application to Framingham Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The M d2 measure can characterize overall effect and individual mediators. In MEGA, adjusted for BMI, sex, age, smoking, status, race/ethnicity, expression platform, and top PCs of gene data as covariates. The analysis led to different estimates and 95% CIs from meta due to several reasons. Meta and systematic reviews have applied mediation to health outcomes, but methodology is underexplored in high-dimensional analysis, particularly estimating total effect of high omics mediators. Gene data used overlapping transcripts across cohorts, resulting in loss of large transcripts. Fixed-effects meta results investigated total effect of expression between age and systolic BP across 5 TOP cohorts. The sample and number of profiled transcripts varied.
Researchers have developed a novel method, PWH, to identify driver genes responsible for cancer development in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH prioritizes genes based on their impact on downstream gene expression across a group of patients with similar mutations and gene profiles. Experiments on 16 cancer datasets from TCG showed PWH excels in identifying known drivers and tumor-specific genes. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PWH outperformed existing methods. Results demonstrated PWH can identify both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improve tumor stratification and provide insights into heterogeneity. One predicted gene, LRP1, was validated in vitro assays, promoting cell proliferation. PWH is a genome/transcript analysis that leverages influence of mutated genes on networks across samples. It hypothesizes samples with same cancer type share molecular characteristics compared to different types. Leveraging samples from same type improves driver prediction. PWH requires somatic mutations, gene profiles, and interaction. For each type, predicted genes were compared to other methods based on overlap with known drivers. PWH quantifies impact by generalized walks on hypergraph. Evaluated across 16 types and benchmarked against existing methods, PWH demonstrates superior performance. Identifying personalized drivers is crucial for precision medicine. PWH provides precise prioritization of known drivers for patients. For each type, aggregated candidate rankings created a prioritization. This allowed comparison with cohort methods. PWH shows variability across types, but most samples demonstrate enrichment in tumor-specific genes. A baseline method randomly selected genes as drivers. PWH scores can be ranked to prioritize candidates. Two benchmark measures compared methods' ability to identify drivers. PWH excels in identifying both common and rare genes. Predicted profiles improve stratification and provide oncologists with candidates for treatment. A predicted gene, LRP, was validated in vitro, promoting proliferation.
This study presents the Virtual Epileptic (VEP) model, a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities, capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG, allowing for evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. The study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, yielding high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and superior performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase model was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. The study aims to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. The VEP model integrates mathematical modeling of neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain involved in seizure generation and propagation. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights into mechanisms of data-generating pathological conditions, such as dynamics and connectivity of abnormal networks. The study revealed robustness and efficiency of the SaSS solver in addressing complex estimation associated with V models, outperforming other parallel solvers in most problems and exhibiting performance when scaling processors. Using Bayesian for hyperparameter tuning, performance was further improved.
Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global health problem with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. In this study, researchers infected rabbits with a virulent clinical M isolate of the Beijing lineage H878, carrying an unstable plasmid p10, and found that the plid is more stable in H878 than in a commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline, with an increase between 28-56 days post-infection and stability between 84-112 days-in. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monotonic change in plid-bearing can be explained by a lung Mtb population consisting of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics. A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain the data when run stochastically. The results suggest bacterial dynamics in subsets of granulomas. The study provides quantitative estimates of how pathogenic M strain H878 replicates in rabbit lungs after aerosol infection, highlighting differences between Mtb and host species.
Researchers have developed a computational tool called GlycanModeler to predict the structure of glycans, which are carbohydrate molecules attached to proteins. Glycans are difficult to model due to their complex chemistry and conformation diversity. Glycaner uses kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was benchmarked on a set of glycan structures and showed high accuracy in de novo modeling and density-guided building. Glycaner was used to design glycans onto a protein nanoparticle to shield regions from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will aid glycoprotein prediction, glycan modeling, and structure determination.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for protein glycosylation, structural validation, analysis, and docking. Recent methods focus on glycan building and refinement using experimental density, especially for structures with many glycans. Glycaner was tested to build structures using crystallographic density to guide and decoy discrimination. Automated glycop modeling must sample chemist, branching, and kinematics to build glycans into density.

Glyer was rigorously optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, with a median RMS of 2.7A. Rosetta protocols continue to be optimized, and deep learning becomes integral to modeling and design. Glyer was used to predict glycans de novo, build into density, and Sugarcoat protein surfaces. The tool was benchmarked on high-resolution glycan structures using SimpleMetrics and rota_scripts, showing high accuracy in de novo and density-guided modeling. Glycans may be forced into higher internal states through local contacts, but low conformations found by Glyer are indicative of probable solution states.

Glyer was used to design glycans onto a protein vaccine scaffold, reducing reactivity in immunization. The tool provides interfaces for creation and evaluation of protocols, and a knowledge-based function to evaluate designs. Glyer was previously used to build glycans into crystallog or cryo density with sub-A accuracy. The modular nature of Rosetta and tools allow them to be used in complex modeling tasks.
Researchers have identified a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFbx-Ace1, in the fungus Penicillium oxum, where the F-box protein (Pobx23) recognizes and activates the transcription factor Ace1 (Ace1) within the nucleus. Ace1 is a ubiquitinated protein and a negative regulator of hemi-cellulase gene transcription in various fungi. However, the deletion of the Pbx gene results in increased transcription of hemi-cellulase genes, contradicting the initial assumption. RT-qPCR and transcriptome results show that Ace is a direct substrate of the SCFbx complex. Among 44 interacting proteins, three transcription regulators were identified, including Zn2C6 fungal transcription factors P_049, P_046, and P_048. The components of the ubiquitin-proteasome are crucial for growth, development, and enzyme synthesis in fungi such as Aspergillus, Neurospora, and Trichma. During mycelial growth, 20% of proteins in Asperg nidans become ubiquinated. The SCF complex undergoes F exchange to recognize substrates to respond to physiological changes or external environments. The role of Pbx in maintaining Ace's activity is vital. In the WT, Pbx is found in three states: most free, a heterodimer with Skp1, and SC complex with Sk1, Cul1, and Rbx. Under glucose, Pbx absence results in decreased brA transcription and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi-cellase genes in Pbx mutant is upregulated. Pbx acts as a coactivator, recognizing Ace, allowing it to regulate target genes with different effects under signals. Deleting Pbx does not affect Ace transcription but results in accumulation of all Ace protein versions. Accumulated Ace is dysfunctional, no longer binds promoters, including cellulase cb1, eg1, hemicellase x11, and pigmentation abB.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of basement membrane (BM) formation and diversification in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium. They found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM secretion, with Rab10 promoting lateral planar-polarized secretion and Rab8 basal secretion, leading to the formation of fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 were present in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins, with DAP essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab route. The exoc complex, specifically the Ex70 subunit, interacted with dystrophin to limit planar polarization and was required for the Rab8 route. These results highlight mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and illustrate how diversity can emerge from spatial control of distinct routes. Analyses of protein secretion in single cells revealed diversification due to Rab-driven lateral and planarized secretion, while Rab promotes basal secretion. The authors propose coexistence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these proteins with cell sites defined by polarity as a mechanism to explain BM diversification during development.
Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach. The model, named language-based universal model (LBUM), was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb data. The LBUM outperformed classical machine learning algorithms, random forests (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GB), and showed improved generalizability across HIV-1 subtypes. The model's performance increased with the size and diversity of the training data, and pretraining with non-bAb data improved generalizability. The LBUM learned patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bn combinations. Antibody contexts, unique vector representations of each antibody, were used to predict epitopes. The model's performance degraded with longer input sequences, but performed better on partial Env. Publicly available datasets are imbalanced in HIV-1 subtypes, compromising models' generalizability to underrepresented subtypes, a problem called subtype bias. The LBUM mitigated subtype bias when trained on all subtypes. The model can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of pathways is associated with disease development and progression. This study considered two strategies to construct predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 sources providing pathway information were implemented in microarray data for MM (GSE324) and a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. The candidate was compared with gene-based model and published in external data. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive in prediction than gene model both internal and external validation. Immune information including V pathways was more predictive for MM and ax outperformed previously models. The model was more resistant to missing values and presence of missing (5%) did not deteriorate accuracy using data imputation. Pathway-based models using lasso were competitive to gene models for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) where data imputation method was integrated for future validation.
Researchers developed a nonlinear dynamical model of Drp-dependent mitochondrial fission to identify parameters regulating the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with parameter μ = k + k - M, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor (M) and k and k are association and dissociation constants between oligomers on the outer membrane. The parameter μ represents the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers. Nondimensionalization results in four dimensionless parameters, but FR and cumulative fission (TF) depend only on μ. TF does not monotonically increase with μ, instead increasing to a point then decreasing as μ continues. This non-monotonic dependence suggests targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive impact on fission. Understanding regulatory parameters like μ may aid future therapeutic selection.

The model focuses on Dr1-dependent fission following cellular injury, with Dr1 persisting on newly created ends. A delay in release could be incorporated with a term or additional pool of f complexes, affecting cytosolic Dr1 concentration. Dr1 oligomerizes to form chain structures, wrapping mitochondria leading to fission. Dr recruitment, oligization, and interaction with outer membrane receptors is known, but contributions to f rate incompletely understood. Under metabolic stress, mitochondria enter hyperission, lower functioning, smaller, and increase programmed death. Inhibiting f through deletion has negative effects, so understanding mechanisms fine-tuning f to preserve function is needed.

The model represents a common pool, f activity of entire cell, with concentration M on OMM across mitochondria. It focuses oligomer process to understand upstream changes affecting number of f events per second. Dr1 recruited to OMM binds receptors like M, Mi49, and Mi51, essential for recruiting Dr1 to mitochondria. Overexpression M increases fission, while Mi49 and Mi51 inhibit. Nonlinear systems focus on Dr1 and M interactions. The model undergoes Hop bifurcation with parameter μ = k + k - M, where M is concentration of M, k and k are association and dissociation constants between oligomers on OMM. Parameter μ represents maximum rate of disassembling oligomers.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR/Cas-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest, and Dros melanogaster, a model organism. The system aims to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure widespread transmission across generations. To mitigate the development of resistance, multiple gRNAs were used to target the T2 gene, inducing nonfunctional mutations at desired sites, reducing the selective pressure for resistance. The system's characteristic is that the phenotype of sterility can be rescued by feeding octamine, which is inexpensive. The study demonstrated robust use of the CRPR/C9 genetic tool to construct GD systems targeting haplos female fertility T2 in both SW and D melanaster. The drive on SW, an economic pest, is meaningful. Gene drive is a novel engineering tool for controlling disease vectors and pests, specifically CRPR/C9-based drive has broad application due to its specificity and flexibility. It functions by biasing inheritance of genes to ensure transmission across successive generations. In gene systems aiming to induce infertility by haplos genes, it is impossible to reverse the phenotype in homozygous females. Therefore, introduction of wild females into the drive transgenic population is necessary to maintain.
Researchers explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks and proposed two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1) only modifying synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. They introduced an energy measure that assumes energy is used solely by synaptic updates and found an approximate square relation between energy and size, M ∝ N0.43.43. The result shows that large networks learn faster but use more energy, restricting plasticity might save energy. To examine this, they only allowed plasticity in a subset of synapses using a random mask, elements drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. They also found that skipping uninformative samples during learning leads to further savings. The study suggests the presence of a competitive algorithm where only a fraction of synapses is modified, biophysically following resource constraints. The algorithms can be combined with earlier work on synaptic caching. Samples were presented in random order, and batching would require storing updates across samples, which is biologically challenging. Training was not batched and weights updated every sample. No substantial savings were found using adaptive schemes like AD, which would be hard to implement biologically. Instead, a fixed learning rate was used. The most efficient plasticity occurs when 1) only the largest updates are implemented and 2) synapses form a pathway in the network. Selecting the maximum has an advantage over a fixed mask. A small network (100 units) was trained for 30 epochs and accuracy saturated. Plasticity is spatially and temporally limited, unlike backprop which updates every synapse every trial, leading to inefficient learning. The study hypothesizes biological plasticity is designed to be energy-efficient.
Researchers engineered the genome of Acinetobacter bayi AD1x by deleting large segments of non-essential genes, resulting in reduced-genome strains with fitness defects. To investigate how evolution can recover lost fitness, they evolved populations of AD1x strains with deletions of 22-42 kilobases and 70-293obases in chemically defined and complex media. Fitness increased in most cases, except two strains that failed in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding and small RNAs were associated with environments and deletions. Global postcription regulators, ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq were mutated across strains, with varied effects on function and fitness. Mutations in this network likely compensate for earlier deletion of transon in ADx ancestor, restoring csr function. Results show evolution can recover fitness through deletion-specific and global adjustments.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebraf, a vertebrate model, using a self-caving ribyme called T3H48HR. They inserted the ribyme in the intron of a reporter gene and observed a 20-fold reduction in expression. The ribyme was also inserted in the intron of the albino gene, leading to a pigmentation similar to the mutant. Using a base-editing, they inactivated the ribyme, showing the phenotype is reversible. A Flase and Cre-activatable version of the ribyme, called RFlip, was created to control mRNA levels of the alb gene. RFlip activation induced knockdown and recapitulated the alb mutant phenotype. A Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in the RFlip cassette labeled cells independently of target gene expression. The RFlip is a flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrates and an alternative to existing knock strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called "aiSEG" that can segment nuclei from bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for dedicated channels, reduces phototoxicity, and speeds up imaging. The software is accessible to users with no prior coding experience and adaptable to new cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEG was evaluated on 20,000 images with 1.1 million nuclei from various cell types and imaging modalities, including challenging conditions like low magnification and live imaging. It accurately segments nuclei similar to manual segmentation and retains biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors signaling activity. The software is available as command line and graphical user interface, agnostic to computational environments, and does not require expert experience. aiSEG was compared to widely used segmentation software Cellpose and Star, and outperformed them. The authors provide curated data with 20,000 images 1.1 million nuclei, the largest publicly available for fluorescence-free nucleus segmentation.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on a "slown prior" to identify relevant features in environments during reinforcement learning. They developed a decision-making task where participants learned which of two features predicted reward, manipulating the speed of feature change. Across two experiments and a preregistered replication, participants learned faster when the reward-predict feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature quickly, compared to the opposite. They generalised learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions. Models with different learning rates showed participants adjusted to the speed of features, with a higher learning rate for slow features and adjusting to relevance and speed. Results suggest humans favour slower features, indicating a bias in learning.

 Participants learned the feature-reward mapping, with accuracy increasing from chance in the first to last trials of a block. Learning rates mediated the effect, with increased from slow and decreased from fast features. The study extends research on slown prior, suggesting it aids learning in reinforcement domains. Participants might learn belief about feature relevance to determine rates. Results show learned featureward mapping and identified higher values in unseen stimuli, with accuracy above chance.

The role of slown prior in human learning was investigated, a bias to focus on changing features. Models with different learning rates showed participants adjusted to the speed of features, with a higher rate for slow and adjusting relevance. The winning model, four rate model, assigned rates to features based on speed and relevance from the first trial. It is assumed participants knew the speed but not which feature relevant. The expected value of a stimulus was the product of feature and weight, updated after choice to reflect outcome with a learning rate. To account for exploration, uncertainty was modelled using a Kalman filter.

The aim was to test if learning differed depending on slow or fast features. Four models embodied hypotheses about feature speed affecting learning. The slown prior promises a biologically plausible way to extract states from input. Despite research in machine learning, studies on slown in human reinforcement are lacking. The idea humans rely on slown during learning was explored. The improvement for slow features is due to being easier to learn or selectively attended. Temporal-correlation of features and rewards enable heuristic strategies.
Researchers investigated the role of Res1, a poorly characterized gene, in metastatic susceptibility in ER-negative breast cancer. Using a mouse genetics approach, they identified Res1 as a novel tumor suppressor gene associated with metastasis. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with evolutionary conserved intron structure, but poor amino acid conservation. CRIS or gene trap models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT) demonstrated reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and incidence of lung metastases. Analysis of matched primary and tumor tissues revealed loss of wild-type Res1, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed potential role of Res1 in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly associated with ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest loss of Res1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control.

The study expanded previous findings by characterizing Res1 as a tumor suppressor and metast modifier in ER breast cancer. Genetic analysis of two mouse strains with different tumor phenotypes identified Res1 as a novel suppressor. Expression in human breast METRIC data and PyxMT backcross samples indicated lower Res1 associated with worse outcomes. Experimental cross between Res1 trap and PyMT showed reduced Res expression increased metastatic disease and pulmonary metastases. Res1 is a poorly characterized gene producing 152 amino acid encoded by single exon. Res1 KO bred to PyMT compared tumor phenotypes Py+/Res1/wt and Py+/1/KO heterozygous. Consistent with gene model, reduction Res1 by CRPR deletion associated increased tumor burden, rapid growth, and pulmonary metastases.

Res1 genetically engineered mouse (EM) generated enhancer trap was used to validate Res as metast modifier and determine disease in vivo. Association Res with cardiovascular disease identified exome-wide study, but mechanistic analysis unknown. Depletion Res1 increased growth and metastasis, potentially suppressing EMT pathway. Res1 enriched exons actively transcribed genes with 1 or predicted G-quadrlex on template and non-strand, implying transcription elongation role. Mechanism unclear.
Researchers investigated the roles of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that deletion of Rad24 resulted in severely impacted spore viability and reduced recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. However, loss of Mec function increased recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB interference, and had less effect on spore viability. Despite differences, complex chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. Both Mec and Rad have important roles in spatial regulation of crossovers (COs). Loss of either Mec or Rad resulted in CO distributions becoming more random, suggesting reductions in global manifestation of interference. These effects are similar but less extreme than the phenotype of 'MM mutants such as zip3, and may be driven by reductions in proportion of interfering COs. In addition to shared roles in CO regulation, results highlight separable roles for Rad as pro-CO factor and for Mec as regulator of recombination, loss which helps suppress broader defects in CO caused by abrogation of DDR.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico-scale metabolic model of Pneumocyst jirovec, a deadly pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder its growth in vitro. The model was developed using published genome data, literature, and bioinformatics tools, and validated with Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement approaches to predict metabolic fluxes and critical components of Pneumyst growth. Findings offer insights into the biology of Pneumyst and provide a strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing the pathogen in vitro. A genome-scale model was also developed for the mouse-specific pathogen Pocyst murina to enable experimental comparisons with in murine models of infection. The model was validated with in vitro culture conditions designed by Meral et al, which support Pyst growth, and extended with Flux Balance Analysis to make predictions regarding metabolic flux and identify critical components of Pyst growth. The model can replicate drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in developing antifungal targets.
Researchers investigated whether increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcription coactivator with PD binding motif (TAZ) (Y/TAZ) are sufficient to induce sustained proliferation in cancer cells under high-density conditions. They developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model incorporating the Hippo-Y/TA pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, and cell-cell interactions. The model simulated cell division, growth, and cell overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential and cell cycle dynamics, particularly mitotic and growth phases. The results showed that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density conditions. The model, which integrates cell dynamics and Hipp-YTA pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, developing drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation, and determining drug dosages. Cancer cells with elevated YTA levels bypass proliferative checks, underscoring the role of YTA in regulating proliferation in oncogenic contexts.
Researchers have developed an energy framework, called the Free Landscape of Stickers (ELS), to study how low-complexity domains (LCD) in proteins influence the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens. ELS uses a continuous "stickiness" scale to investigate the effects of LCD patterns on condens dynamics and material properties. By varying the complexity of sequences, they found that periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. The framework explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity through periodicity variations. The study reveals that minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condens, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. ELS provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded material properties, where features of landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. The research addresses the role of complexity in governing dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens, advancing understanding their functions and roles.
Researchers investigated the role of non-mus myosin II in dental epithelial invagination using the mouse as a model. They found that myos II is essential for epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movement in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating my II via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AK and my II can rescue defects caused by inhibition of Sh. Results support a model in which Sh signals through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. My II acts at multiple levels to generate forces and maintain intercellular adhesion, perturbations in My mutants impede convergent-driven narrowing of the cord and inv itself. The study demonstrates the importance of my in maintaining celladhesion in stratified epithelium, consistent with prior findings that my-generated forces are essential for maintenance and growth of junctions in cultured cells. Inhibition of Sh perturbs inv and celladhesion, also observed in My mutants, can be rescued by forced my activation. The study proposes that Sh from initiation controls tooth development by activating my in the bud, which promotes cellad and movement to drive convergent extension and inv of the epithelium.
Researchers have developed a deep learning model called single-cell graph convolutional network (scGCN) to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scAC-se) data. The model, scGC, addresses the challenge of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity between datasets by leveraging transfer learning from scRNA-se to scAC-se as a domain adaptation problem in transfer learning. scGC uses a multistage learning strategy to integrate gene and chromatin data into a unified multiomics cell atlas, achieving hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. The model formulates cell-cell relationships and gene expression with convolution network based on kinetic relationships between regulatory mechanisms of sc-se and scAC. It explores the idea of MKMD-based adaptation for transferable features in embeddings of sc-se and scAC, enabling the model to leverage domain-specific effects. Multiple kernels adapt representations enhance effectiveness between embeddings of sc-se and scAC. scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as sc-se and scAC. The framework is an end-to-end and hypothesis-free for integrating single-cell multiomics with high accuracy and robustness, combining omics autoencoders with convolution networks and learning. It integrates different omics data with different distributions. Compared to Seurat, Conos, scJoint, and GL, label results demonstrate scGC as an effective tool for large-cell datasets, providing insights into biological systems at single-cell level. The model focuses on cell classification, but can be used for other tasks like trajectory, cell interaction, and time-series analysis.
Researchers have characterized the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a protein essential for cell growth and chromatin loading. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling, they demonstrate that precise positioning of basic residues within the LS is critical for nuclear transport through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mc3, resulting in defective chromatin loading and poor growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which lack a universally conserved sequence but share key characteristics with the LS of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. Further characterization of Mc's LS will elucidate cell-dependent nuclear import and loading, refine predictions of putative NLS in many proteins. Mutagenesis identified specific residues within Mc's LS critical for function, including P2 and P3, which mediate interactions with importin. Unexpectedly, Mc3SV-NLS mutant fails nuclear import despite AF predicting contacts with Kap at P and P. Constitutive localization observed in full-length and C-terminal Mc lacking NES. Defective import may compromise MCM loading, leading to growth defects. Chromatin association of M in arrested G or G/M phases confirmed this hypothesis. AF modeled interaction between importin and Mc's LS variants, demonstrating shared contacts with Kap. Conservation suggests Mc's conserved region crucial for import, flanking sequences necessary for optimal activity. Truncation mutants evaluated via plasm shuffling showed growth defects.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism, and is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. The protein functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mNP-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Research has shown that the LSm-like domain of At2, which stimulates mRNA, antagonizes mNP assembly. This study advances these findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) and co-localization immunoprecipitation indicate that poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 of Atin may be a major determinant of mRNA and protein of Atin mNPules. Experiments with transgenic Doph indicate that the2LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions supportx-induced cytotoxicity. The data lead to a proposal for howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured contribute to specificity and efficiency of R gran condensation as well as neurogeneration.

 The study further elaborates mechanisms of Atin functions in mRNA and mNP assembly, showing that the P2 of Atin and interactions with AB are essential for gran but required to recruit At-target mRN and protein intoin gran. RNA proteins can associate with mRN across stages processing, transport, translation, or transl control, andin may be such a protein. It is translational activator of Doph period, repressor of miRNA, facilitator of mNP and stress-gran formation, and stabilizer ofin-associated mRN. Work showed thatin mutants lacking IDR forin gran in Doph neurons and S cells were resistant to neurogeneration. The conserved region ofin, P2, known to associate with AB, played a role in this process. The study used Galts-controlled el-G4 to expressin-2P2AD in Doph brains and RNA-Seq to identify RNAs in poly selected RNA compared within procedures. Observations indicate P2 binding AB on the poly tail mRN helps the composition ofin gran.

 The study identifies interactions betweenin's P2 and AB as critical to the assembly ofin-containing mNP. Suggests a mechanism by which multiple interactions select mRNA and protein of gran. Thein, guided by P2AB and L domain, recruits mRN and proteins into mPs. Second, in-associated may move into gran whose formation is facilitated byin-mediated condensation. Postulate mRN in assemblies are stored in a form protected from degradation.
This study investigated the roles of Pitx and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells (Mu) in extraocular muscles (EOM) using genetically modified mice. The results showed that Pitx is dispensable for Mu specification and maintenance in EOM despite being a major regulator during early development. Constitutive inactivation of Pax postnatally led to a greater loss of Mu in E compared to limb. The study proposes a relay between Pitx, Myf, and Pax for E stem cell maintenance. Mu in E adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb muscles and do not proliferate in adult, yet E have a higher content of Pax+ Mu per pre and postnat. In contrast, limb Mu proliferate in mdx mouse for Duchenne dystrophy, less Mu were present in E of mdx compared to controls and were not proliferative. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and insights into the sparing of E during muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-IN, which combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. The algorithm emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and achieve accurate fitting. Variants of COVID-19 exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments. To evaluate the risk, simulating transmission within the population and time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial. The VOC-IN leverages available data and physical principles governing disease to capture the time-vary nature of parameters. 

The algorithm integrates Physics-Informed Networks (PIN) with disease models, particularly the proposed VOC-IN, represents a significant contribution. VOC-IN accurately fits data and infers time-vary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into neural networks. The evolution of viruses allows them to adjust to environments and hosts; SARS-2 continues to evolve and mutate. Since 2020, several SARS-2 variants with significant mutations emerged and classified by WHO as VOCs (concern) or VOIs (interest). The algorithm was applied to the spread of VOCs in the province of BC and its regions, results aligning with real data and enabling short-term predictions. Parameters from the network are persuasive and simulations using ODE validate accuracy.
Researchers introduce CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that aggregates single-cell data into profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning, improving performance by 30-68% in average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single morphological feature data and providing an aggregated profile as output. The model achieves this by downweighting mitotic cells or debris and prioritizing large, uncrow cells. The approach requires perturbation labels for training, readily available in cell profiling datasets. CyNet offers a post-processing step for single profiles that significantly boosts performance on image-based datasets.

CytoNet applies contrastive learning to already-extracted single features, making it applicable to most image profiling datasets. The data is treated as a collection of sets, where each sample corresponds to a set based on the mathematical definition. The Deep Sets formulation learns a model that aggregates single data into a profile that outperforms population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism of action. CyNet's latent representation prioritizes biological signal over technical variance at cell and plate levels. Although it cannot be transferred out-distribution, it can be re-trained on new data, making a valuable tool for future profiling studies.

CytoNet captures heterogeneity, a characteristic of cell populations, improving profile information and utility in image-based applications. An examination reveals that relevant cells are generally larger, isolated, and do not contain high-intensity pixels. Single profiles are aggregated by various methods to a perturbation that describes population's phenotype. Profiles can be compared to identify unrecognized cell states induced by perturbations. Image-based profiling is a powerful tool for drug discovery, genomics, and phenotyping, but challenges include capturing population and single variability. CyNet addresses these limitations, automatically aggregating single data to improve profile information.

CyNet's performance is consistent with studies emphasizing context when analyzing phenotypic variance and genetic interactions, supporting focusing on large, uncrow cells provide accurate data for perturb effects on populations. The model is limited to data under similar conditions as training. In contrast, larger cells receive higher weights.
Researchers have developed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study highlights the value of characterizing brain dynamics and costs in understanding cognitive processes and offers insights into the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. A stochastic framework was employed to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during the Stro task. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG data, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in experiments. The method was generalized to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than fMRI, analyzing a dataset on performing a Stro task. A correlation was found between cost and RTs, showing reduced cost associated with improved performance.
Researchers investigated the development and function of atypical memory B cells (aBC) in individuals exposed to Plasmodium vivax (P. viv) malaria. They generated P. viv-binding protein II (PvDBI) probes to detect and study the development and durability of P. viv-specific aBC and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PDBI-specific aBC were elicited during malaria and persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address the biology and function of P. viv-specific aBC in producing antibodies, a single BC was cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding and inhibition. aBC clones produced variable levels of anti-PDBIg in cultures, and some produced high levels comparable to classical BC. Among aBC, A12 and B11 produced neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PDBI variants. Notably, BC receptors (BCRs) of PDBI-specific aBC expressed unique IGH genes with usage IGH1, comparable to classical BC. Somatic hypermutation (SH) and CDR length of VH and VK in these BC subsets were not different. Findings revealed P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC. Accumulation of aBC during infections might play a role in producing antibodies against malaria. 

The study demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aBC in P. viv malaria in acute infections. PvDBI2-specificBC were detected in 17 individuals (0.024, 0.020). Of these, 11.28 and 40 expressed aBC and BC phenotypes respectively. Four clones aBC produced anti-PDBI antibodies low reactivity. The challenge in developing an efficacious malaria vaccine is the antigen polymorphism of parasites. The study assessed generation cross-reactive aBC from P viv infections and competency to secrete antibodies variant antigens. Expansion aBC in malaria has been reported, but competency these cells differentiate into ASC secreting anti-malar antibodies unknown. The study used single cultures to demonstrate P viv-specific a function in differentiation. The system contains MSL feeder and cytokines IL, IL, IL, IL, and BA. Result P viv-infected individuals with first clinical symptoms developed antigen aBC. Acquisition aBC to malaria not associated repeated or chronic exposure. Evidence supported previous reporting expansion atypicalBC normal humoral response malaria and influenza.
Researchers introduced mr-r, an extension of the mr mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it applicable to datasets not publicly available and scalable to biob-size data. mr-r is a flexible and computationally efficient method that models phenotypes jointly and leverages effects across phenotypes to improve accuracy. Through simulations, mr-r is competitive and outperforms current-state-of-art methods for single and multi-phenotypic polygenic prediction in various scenarios differing in pattern effect sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of causal variants, and heritability. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKobank showed mr-r achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for majority of traits, especially with smaller sample size. mr-r is robust to small to medium missing phenotypes and outperforms methods in 14 out of 16 blood phenotypes. mr-r addresses limitations of mr, requiring individual-level data and lack of scalability to biob-size data. mr-r is a summary version of the empirical Bayes multivariate multiple regression method, learning patterns of effect across phenotypes, modeling dozens jointly, and computationally efficient. mr-r is robust to violation of assumption of complete overlap across phenotypes.
This study proposes a novel framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (U) model. Data from the Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the U model using deep learning and calibrate the mechanistic model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. The study projects the attack and peak of new infections for the Omic wave in China after the dynamic-COVID policy adjustment, indicating an attack rate and peak of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97 and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations show heterogeneity decreases herd immunity 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak 30-70 days, aligning with real cases. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity.

 The approach involves shaping the spread of susceptibles during the Omic variant outbreak using two methodologies: employing deep learning for the U model and MCM for the mechanistic model. Given limited information, the U framework is a good for learning recruitment from data, utilizing the universal property of neural networks to present and train the specific form. A generalized framework and machine learning approach is developed to pre-set the specific form from epidemic data. The model is applied to project trends of COVID-19 variants, comparing accuracy with traditional frameworks. The aim is to embed spatio-temp heterogeneity into homogeneous models for efficient prediction and enhance accuracy.

 The study incorporates heterogeneity into classical models, depicting the epidemic curve of the Omic variant in China, including size, size, immunity, and duration. The accuracy is significantly enhanced compared to homogeneous. A dual strategy combines strengths of learning and mechanistic to a comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting disease dynamics. Estimated results show the data-driven approach is flexible in capturing information, with a slight increase around day 65. The importance of incorporating method into compartment frameworks is highlighted, enhancing accuracy and decision-making in infectious diseases.
Researchers have proposed a new framework that views synapses as agents interacting with their postsynaptic neurons in a way similar to how an organism interacts with its environment. This framework suggests that synapses use noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsyn neuron. A mathematical model was developed, which shows that synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics that is updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. The approach implies that synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty about somatic potential. Each syn strives to predict somatic dynamics of postsyn neuron, but emergent dynamics of many synapses in a network resolve learning problems such as classification or closed-loop control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties on network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

 The study shows that synapses can exploit noisy transmission to encode uncertainty about somatic potential. The model predicts syn should be stochastic to encode somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity in post-post spike protocols and dependence on synaptic weight. A learning rule was derived that minimizes surprise in syn, enabling syn to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes. Synaptic variability was also used to reflect uncertainty in firing, with postsyn neuron learning to fire according Gaussian distributions of times with spreads. Variability in firing was reflected in neuron spiking, with high trial-trial variability in membrane potential.

 On the network level, simulations indicate that synapses exploit noise to master learning paradigms despite ambiguous inputs. A pattern task was created by mixing spikes of two patterns with different rates, and mixing 0 corresponds to identical pattern. This was encoded by network with unreliable synapses and reliable transmission. The study presents a syn-centric view of predictive processing that views synapses as interacting with postsyn like organism with environment. The emerging learning rule is consistent with experimentally observed mechanisms and analytically tractable.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data of healthy tissues. The method addresses challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, by computing distances between cells and reconstructing the tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Scup is embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method's robustness is investigated using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation, but comes with challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup is a probabilistic framework that reconstructs cell trees from healthy, diploid single-cells using whole-genome amplified DNA sequencing data. The method is designed with the challenges of sc-seq data in mind, fits well with biological findings, and obtains better accuracy leveraging read-phasing. Scup is a distance-based phylogen inference that reconstructs cell trees from sc-se data produced by amplifying cells' genomes using methods like MDA and MALAC. The method distinguishes somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification.
Researchers developed the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, a tailored tool to evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in Malawi, addressing limitations of analytic approaches used to weigh evidence for interventions. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating country-specific data on disease incidence, health behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under resource constraints, they simulated health gains under plausible HBP strategies. A linear optimization (LA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain, ~8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other prioritization approaches, such as service based on patient characteristics, achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark on a yearly basis and 5% reduction DALs over the period, suggesting this approach might be beneficial. The TLO provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, providing evaluations on health achievable through prioritization of services under realistic resource constraints, addressing limitations of other methods.
Researchers employed oligo DNA FISH to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella and compared findings to previous studies in the silkworm Bomby mor, which diverged over 100 million years ago. They found that pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends and form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bomby, Plodia bival can orient in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci toward chromosome centers, regardless of where they are located, and sister kinetocho are not paired. Instead, four kincho are observed at metaph I with clear microtub attachments and lateral attachments orienting separated kincho. These findings challenge the view that paired pole-facing kincho are required for hom separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as novel organisms can lead to discovery of new biology. Oligo FISH was used to characterize meiotic chromosome in Plodia for the first time, visualizing single chromosomes at subchromosomal resolution. Meiotic hom pairing during sperogenesis is initiated at gene chromosome ends, mirroring previous studies in Bomby. The mechanism may be conserved in Lepidoptan insects. In Plodia and Bomx, telomeres are not used for kinoch formation, despite pole-facing position. Instead, observed D1 localization away from telom and closer to chromosome center, similar to Plodia. This suggests moths employ novel "center-kin" segregation during sperogenesis where kinoch formation is restricted to chromosome center.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor SOX3 in the development of the median eminence (ME), a region of the brain that connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. They found that mutations affecting SOX result in hypopituitarism, a condition where the pituitary gland does not produce enough hormones, and that this is likely due to a problem in the hypothalamus, not the pituit itself. The study showed that SOX is expressed in the ME, particularly in NG-glia cells, which are a type of glial cell, and that loss of SOX affects their proliferation and differentiation, leading to a reduction in pituit hormone levels. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, which affects NG-glia, restored pituit function and hormone levels, but not myelination. Changes in the gut microbiome also improved hypopuitar in SO3 mutants. Conditional deletion of SO3 in the central nervous system caused hypopuitar postnatally, at weaning, with defective endocrine cell maturation in the pituit. SO3 is expressed in hypothamic stem cells and deletion affects their proliferation in vitro and in hypothamic neurospheres. The study highlights a role of NG-g in ME function during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals.
In C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis, the GTPase CED-10/Rac is activated by the GEF CED-5/C-12 to promote corpse engulfment of dying cells. However, the GEF for C-10 during epider cell migration is unknown. C-5/C-12 is a two-component GEF that activates C-10 to promote corpse engulfment and migration of the larval distal tip cell. C-5/C-12 supports epider migrations, as loss leads to embryonic lethality due to failed epider cell migration. Surprisingly, C-12 inhibits F-act in the epider, opposite of expected for C-10 GEF. To address the opposing effects of C-12 on F-act, the GAP function of C-12 was investigated. A GAP region in C- away from the CEF catalytic region was mutated, altering epider cell function and not corpsement. Interfering with GEF by C-5 ability to bind Rac/C-10 resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpsement. Genetic studies suggest the GAP acts on different Gases. C-5/C-12 support cycling multiple Gases by distinct domains to promote and inhibit F-act nucleation. The GEF for C-10 during epider migration is unknown, with 18 Gs found in C. elegans regulating CDC42 or RHO. C-5/CK and C-EL are bipart GEFs promoting C-10 during corpsement. C-10 acts in ventral enclosure of the epider to enclose the embryo. The G for C- during this process is unknown. Loss of C- and its proposed G C- caused opposite effects on epider F- levels. Mutations in C- and C resulted in embryonic lethality due to migration arrest at stages. Our findings support the embryonic lethality of C- due to failure to regulate F- during epider migrations, resulting in increased F dynamics and epider enclosure.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with sensory input reproduced these observations, suggesting the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for efficient neural code. The study tested whether observed timescales were gradual or parallel, finding a gradual increase had more predictive power for both correlation and timescales, indicating hierarchical processing in mouse cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer integration of information, thought to cause long times in primates, was tested, showing feed processing predicts higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with natural movie compared to spontaneous activity. The results suggest intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase in recurrence, shape temporal hierarchy. A hierarchy of timescales was found in the visual pathway, an important since rodents have fewer hierarchical stages, allowing information to be provided in parallel to multimodal or motor outputs. Stimulus-dependent decrease in predict is in agreement with efficient coding and observed in rodents, forming invariant high-level representations, a hallmark of temporal processing in mammals.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits engaged during T are poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to T, and a new opportunity to model circuit dynamics. A study used epidural recordings from the cervical of human subjects to develop a computational model of motor cortical macro through the mechanisms underlying response to T, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify pathways, and machine learning used to identify circuit features among pathways. Sensitivity identified neuron types that preferentially contributed corticinal waves. Single wave could be predicted by average probability of paths between activated type L5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Conduction of shortest path to PT determined latency of corticinal wave. Multiple neuron activations could modulate particular cortinal wave. Results support hypothesis different pathways contribute cortinal with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to motor cortex as well as specific types within motor initiated I-waves. Methodology provides computationally tractable sensitivity on complex models relating structure to identify mechanisms underlying response acute stimulation.

Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in maternal circulation during gestation and carries potential as a research and clinical tool for investigating the placental genome across gestation, previously requiring invasive placental sampling. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidies. Directing attention to cell-free DNA in pregnancy improves understanding placental processes, functional role in pregnancy, and monitoring placental health. cDNA is representative of the placental genome, providing non-invasive genome characterization. NI has been implemented to screen common aneupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in plasma-free. The effectiveness of NI for anup screening has been reviewed elsewhere. cDNA carries placental genome imprint status, proposed for differentiating cDNA from maternal-free. cDNA methylation has potential as a tool for research and nonvasive screening. cDNA originates from trophlasts, the major placenta cell type, making it more accurate to refer to cDNA as placental cDNA. Increases in cDNA near delivery, preterm, and inflammation-associated pathologies provide rationale for exploration. In vitro studies investigated pro-inflammatory cDNA from mouse and human placental explants. Future research explores cDNA nonvasive plac genomic aberrations in placental dysfunction and complications. Han colleagues demonstrated feasibility and utility of nonvasively inferring placental expression maternal cDNA. The reported reduced plac-specific genes in pregnant cDNA compared non-pregnant cDNA. Plac SNP can be inferred parental genotypes, direct interrogation individual cDNA. Plac and maternal SNP used identify cDNA background cDNA.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the shared genetic risk factors among hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers. They identified 44 multi-HDC regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs, with two regions containing risk for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDC, and 28 for two HDC. Integrating genome-wide association data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at 22-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established cancer genes from the COSMIC Cancer Census, but had previously unreported pleiotropic roles. They also pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk in regions that altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate-HDC genes, implying some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. The study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility.
A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls in the Kiker dog breed identified a region on chromosome C19 associated with polymyositis (PM) with a p-value of 4.7*10-10. Haplotype analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared by cases in homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozyg for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10-49 upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for PM in Kiker dogs. Postulated penetrance of the disease was 10-20 for homozyg and 0.5-2 for heterozygous dogs. Results indicate variants may be found at least 10 kb upstream of IL. The study demonstrates involvement of IL/IL in PM but the responsible element and function are yet to be discovered.
Researchers developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 protein domains. They fine-tuned ESM on the folding of small domains and showed it generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned language model for stability prediction. ESM performs reasonably on small domains but lags behind state-of-art on larger proteins. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature. ESM generalizes well to natural and de novo proteins with no sequence alignment to the training set. Training on multiple domains improves correlation from 0.35 to 0.14 compared to training on a single domain. The mega dataset addresses the difficulty of measuring stability across multiple domains in a uniform condition and helps compare paradigms, transfer from homolog sequences and learning all collectively.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1). They hypothesized that iIR would have an opposite effect in autoimmunity compared to their role in chronic infections, where they enhance T-cell control. The study found that iIR genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations in T1. This was validated in an independent dataset. The results suggest iIR decrease HLA class II protective associations, indicating i regulate CD4 T responses in T1. The study used an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961) and found that iIR genes with ligands have a protective effect on HLA II genetic associations. This is in contrast to previous findings in chronic infections where iIR enhanced protective and detrimental HLA associations. The study suggests iIR modulate CD4 T responses in autoimm. The researchers also found that iIR expression on CD4 cells was not increased in T1 patients, arguing against a direct effect of iIR on T cells. A mathematical model of immune destruction of β-cells predicted iIR modulation of protective but not detrimental H associations. The iIR interaction was significant in 4 out of 5 genotypes in the expected direction. The study concludes iIR negatively impact protective effects of class II genotypes in T1, attributable to iIR-HLA receptor interactions.
Fuchs endothelial corne dystrophy (FE) is the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans, with up to 80% of European cases attributed to a non-coding CT repeat expansion, CT18.1, within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, T4. The nonoding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven molecular components of disease within primary-derived corne endothelial cells from a large cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded and CT-independent FE. Long-read, short, and transcript techniques interrogate expansion-specific transcript biomarkers. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data reveal global altered splicing in FE and transcripts associated with CT18 expansions. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences of FE within endothelial cells. Exon usage, pathway, and transcript reveal T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome from 134 FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underpinning FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice, a crucial trait for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qLT11 from variety Arroz Terra, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. The candidate region was delineated to a 52-kb interval containing REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra GFh allele encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitb harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar Terra allele decreased LT, whereas overexpressing functional GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is causal behind qLT. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in Hitb background carrying 172-k genomic fragment from Ar Terra including GFh showed superior LT compared to Hitb, with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh from Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) relaxed circular (rc) DNA possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative strand derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). The study investigated whether TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on HBrcDNA and which copy is removed during covalently circular (cc) DNA formation. A mutant HB cell line HepDES182G was established with a C2G mutation in the pgRNA sequence altering the 3' TR, while the 5 TR remained wild type. Production of HBrc and ccDNA in HepDES cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed the positive strand of rcDNA and ccDNA predominantly carried the wt2 residue, indicating the 5 TR serves as template during rc replication forming a duplex with the strand, while the 3 forms a flap structure removed during cc formation. A survey of cellular endonucleases using loss-of-function study found the 3 endonuc Mus plays a role in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells alongside the 5 enduc F1. The findings shed light on HBrc structure and cc mechanisms contributing to understanding HB replication.

A study introduced mutations into the 5 terminus of duck BHB rcDNA and analysis revealed the high frequency of the strand synthesis used the mutated 5 TR as template and the mutant 5 TR was largely replaced by wild-type 3 sequence cc. HB is a member of the Hepadnavidae family replicating its genome via reverse transcription of pregen RNA by covalently circular cc, the persistent form of HB genome and authentic template in infected hepatocyte. To investigate TR selection during rc and cc biosynthesis, a mutation was introduced into the 3 TR. The rationale mutating 3 instead of 5 is the latter requires priming site in 5 epsilon the 6 upstream of 3 DR on pg, important for initiation viral transcription.

The canonical 3 terminal of rc in Hep and Hep cells is due to tetMV-driven pg transcription from engineered HB transgene in inducible cells. The majority of recessed ends mapped at in control cells, significantly upon Mus knockout, indicating may predominantly cleave the 3 between and. During HB replication, the mutation at the 5 end pg will be transcribed into in the 3 TR while the 5 maintains. A mutation was introduced into plid pREHBDES and established a tetr-induc HB stable line HepDES as described. The establishment and persistence HB rely viral cc, a non-repating episome formed in infected hepatocyte through conversion of rc. Compared the HB line HepDES, HepDES exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic replication and cc production upon induction. 3 R and sequencing confirmed the mutation in rc produced HepDES cells.
Researchers developed a microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic model (mmEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model encompassed three microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Findings revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic loading rates (OLR) increased, with a decline in FC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OL and high OL. Simulations revealed constraints on SO growth under high OL due to reduced sulfide-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under OL enabled scenario-based simulations to explore impact of acidity on SO growth and FC performance. This work highlights metabolic crossfeeding's role in shaping community response to OL. Insights will inform FC technology implementation in real-world environments.

Simulations using mmEM investigated changes in metabolic capacities of key groups and substrate influence interactions within MFC. Varying acet consumption of SO (LB from 0.05 to 3.15 mmol g2cell-1h-1) and sulfide release of SR (UB from 4.39 to 13 affected performance. FC treating sulfide wastewater from canned factory declined as OL increased during high seasons. Metabolic crossfeeding among SR, MET, and SO described growth relationships in response to OL. mmEM simulated abundances under low and high OL, highlighting roles of SR, MET, and SO in shaping community MFC across OL. Observed adaptation linked to crossfeeding among guilds influencing FC. A micro-micro interaction-scale model mmEM was developed to study associations in MFC, focusing on adaptation to OL. Metabolic fluxes between high and low OL denoted log fold change (FC). Metabolic crossfeeding among SR, MET, and SO described growth in response to OL through butyrate, acet, sulfate, sulf, CO2, H, and formate.
Researchers have developed a machine learning (ML) framework, called CPEC, to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in biological applications such as enzyme function prediction. When ML models are applied to unseen situations, they can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. To address this issue, CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for a given enzyme. Conform prediction provides statistical guarantees that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at lower F than existing methods, and accurate for enzymes underrepresented in training. CPEC is expected to be useful for biological applications where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited. The framework leverages conform prediction to enable users to specify desired F tolerance, tailored to experiment goals and makes predictions with controlled F. C is demonstrated using enzyme annotation as a case, simulating discovery of functions of less-character enzymes.
Researchers investigated the role of the heat shock protein HSP-90 in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for TDP-43. They found that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult animals, accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. H-90 interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its conformation, but its contribution to neurotoxicity in vivo was unknown. H-90 mutation upregulates key stress responsive heat shock gene expression, including H-70 and H-16.1, and normal levels of H-16.1 are required for H-90 effects on T-43. The neuroprotective effect of H-90 does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. The study demonstrates H-90 chaper activity contributes to adverse outcomes in T-43 proteinopathies in a whole animal model of ALS. Disrupting H-90 genetically or with small inhibitors is sufficient to protect against T-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration. C. elegans models expressing human ALS T-43 exhibit progressive motility defects, degeneration of motor neurons, and accumulation of phosphorylated T-43. H-90 has a role in modulating T- misfolding and toxicity, and its loss affects accumulation of total and disease-associated phosphorylated T-43 proteins. H-90 inhibition can be neuroprotective, facilitating clearance of T- by the transcription factor HSF-1, which activates heat response.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucle RNA and AT sequencing, mapping their data to the Drosophila melanogaster ovary dataset to shed light on conserved programs between distantly related Arthrop species. They identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ, follicle, and muscle cells, and explored gene regulation of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. Single nucleus sequencing resolved cellular complexity in the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Doph ovarian clusters, suggesting conserved expression programs for cellular identity and function. The study mapped clusters to the Doph ovary dataset, supporting high conservation of molecular pathways defining cellular identity in the ovary.

The researchers performed 10x single nucleus sequencing on ovaries from females with and without males, and replicates of 10 Multiome AT+ expression on ovar from unmated females, resolving heterogeneity in the Artem female system and regulatory chromatin in cell types. They characterized expression of Z-linked genes in oogenesis, testing dosage and sex chromosome inactivation in the germl of the Z system, enhancing understanding sex regulation during meiosis. The study highlights single-nucle RNA as an alternative to traditional approaches for meiotic sex regulation in species difficult to isolate meiotic cells. Although crustans have pano ovaries, mistic ovar are typical Branchop, facilitating parallels with Doph melanaster, the most studied system in molecular and morphological data.
Chronic pain is a widespread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The specific mechanisms remain unclear, allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This work analyzes biophys-motivated subcircuits that represent motifs in neural in laminae-II of the horn. These are hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of populations excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits. Parameters are specified by experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. Sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysreg of subcirc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation inhibitory signaling or upregulation excitatory responses. Mechanisms, subcirc components, and proportion vary depending on substructure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies.

The identification multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal circuits suggests dysreg may occur through mechanisms dependent on injury. Modeling interactions among interne populations for maintenance E balance in healthy and disruption allody. Painful stimuli activity on fibers activate excitatory and downstream neurons. Normal responses excit populations non-pain signaled by A input gated inhibitory. Allody occurs E balance disrupted non-pain A input firing excitatory leading activation downstream neurons. Treatment chronic conditions require understanding underlying causes. Dysregulation E balance dorsal circuit is supported preclinical, but incomplete understanding complexity leaves questions how dysreg occurs.

Subcircuits reflect experimental structure mediating static and dynamic allody. Spiking properties in rate networks analyze interactions cellular patterns structure maintaining or disrupting E balance dorsal circuits. Studies static and dynamic allody mediated afferent inputs. A simple subircuit represents "gate" model. Inhibitory inhibits excitatory populations receiving A input. Excitatory directly signals projection neurons allody defined sustained firing response A input. Experimental identifying dorsal circuit and relationships interne types provide constraints improve models therapies.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) and its cochaperones in the function of elongation factor 2 (EF), a protein essential for ribosome translocation. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF function, with some mutants affecting steady-state levels of EF and others altering sensitivity to diphia toxin, a post-translational modification of EF. The study suggests that H contributes to proteostasis not only by protein folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Further, results indicate that yeast Hsp mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochones. The researchers also identified a novel cochone, H1, that bridges interaction of EF with H or the TRC chaper, and found that overexpression of EF in H mutants resulted in negative growth defects similar to those lacking CPR or CNS. Mutations in yeast EF that mimic disease-associated mutations in human EF were impacted by loss of H1 and one was partially rescued by overexpression of H1. The study provides evidence that H90 has roles in translation elongation in addition to initiation and that the interaction of H1 and EF with TRC and H90 may represent independent pathways or sequential.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in a gambling task both alone and after observing others' choices. Participants in both groups showed disrupted use of utility-based computations for risky options, but for socially situated decisions, they increased conformity with others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The study used a decision task to examine whether heuristics facilitate socially situated decision-making about risk when utility is disrupted. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk processing and used social information from others to guide decisions. Findings suggest conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based information in socially situated decision-making when individuals' risk processing is impaired. A parametric relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices heuristic, with those most disrupted in utility-based decision conforming most with others' choices. This was replicated in an independent sample, providing convergent evidence for a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively demanding heuristics in social decision-making.
This study explores the concept of biomorphs, a simplified model of morphological development, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. Researchers found that biomorphs exhibit a type of developmental bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear than others through random mutations. This bias shows a preference for simpler phenotypes with low description complexity, formalized by an information-theoretic principle. Using population simulations, they demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through random mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biomorph structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in molecular-genotype maps. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome explains these patterns. The study suggests that bias towards simplicity and patterns in biomorph share with molecular-genotype maps may hold widely for developmental systems. The authors analyze the generation of phenotyp variation systematically in biom and test the hypothesis that this model of morphological development exhibits simplicity and phenomena observed in molecular maps. They find that phenotyp bias influences adaptive evolution when phenotypes convey an advantage, making the frequent and simpler phenotype more likely to evolve.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The study consisted of three experiments where participants hit targets aligned with or purposefully offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the system close to the N, even when targets were away from the N, by adjusting arm stiffness to align resonant motions to the task. This extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, emphasizing capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, including shaping dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. The study used a tool to compute N in nonlinear systems, which are not analytically derivable like eigenmodes of linear systems. Pendulum motions were excited by participants supported the hypothesis that humans are sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively exciting numerically predicted eigenfrequencies. Participants used strategies to drive oscillations, such as bang-bang, to achieve higher rates. A sweep and random motions were applied to the system to verify it does not automatically fall into N without stabilization. The study highlights the importance of resonance for humans and their capabilities to excite, contributing to underlying mechanisms of human motion control, especially excitation of periodic motions.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in responding to environmental stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude. Transition regulators (TSRs) control developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. Two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulerrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis indicates that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under the control of Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced. In vitro data show a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems underscores the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology.

 Biochemical analysis shows regulators of the pul biosynthesis operon and transition regulators Sco and Abr bind the yC promoter with differing affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is under tight repression during exponential growth by two regulatory systems. Transition regulators Sco and Abr have been studied for diverse aspects of Bacillus physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm. Microarray analysis of the effect of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in complex media.

We establish roles of PR and Abr in regulation of expression in vitro and provide evidence Sco can bind the yC in vitro. Together, results establish a model where pulerr biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary phase and input from PR linking phase with extracellular sequestration. Results suggest PR and Abr act as roadblocks to RNAP at yC. The role of Sco involves direct and indirect regulation through another factor Sco modulates. The presence of three repressors is necessary to limit production, providing mechanistic insight into the network of pul production in bacteria.
Researchers developed a mathematical model of the neural circuits controlling mictition after spinal cord injury (SCI) to investigate the effects of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) on bladder function. The model replicated detrus-sinct dyssynergia and overactive bladder, conditions observed after SCI, and simulated the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex. The model showed that low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) normalized voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. The model suggested that neuroplasticity and complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate effects of SCI on mictition and that neuronal modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand mechanisms of T reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI. A framework for model-based analysis of neural circuits controlling mition after SCI and effects of T on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction was developed. The model built on a state-of-the-art model to capture normal/void functions under healthy conditions and disorders of the bladder after SCI, such as detrus-sinct dyssynerg and overactivity of the bladder. The effect of T on the spinal was modeled at single-cell based on experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings. The patterns of bladder activity after SCI derive from interactions among spinal interneurons, plasticity, and reorganization of circuit that foster emergence of latent void reflex. When SCI occurs above T10, communication between brainstem and mition circuits is blocked or attenuated. The model showed that sensitivity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons is crucial for selective activation bladder and sphinct inhibition via pudal stimulation. T also improved incontinence dyssy in patients with SCI.
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from optical density (OD) data without the need for calibration, making it accessible to microbiology laboratories that collect OD data. The model treats OD as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. It outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves and overcame discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus measured data. The model was evaluated using Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and estimated morphology-specific growth using measured data. The model's ability to fit and predict OD was demonstrated using time-course OD data for A. fumatus, and its estimated growth rates were compared to directly measured data. The study aimed to model filamentous growth and estimate morphology-specific rates from OD at 600nm without collecting calibration, considering OD is an indirect measure. Calibration data for microbes like bacteria cannot be reused for filament fungi due to size and shape sensitivity. Directly fitting models to true growth resulted in misfit and lower rates compared to estimated from measured data. A solution is using indirect measures, such as OD, for fitting and growth estimation. The model outperformed non-parametric-based models in fitting and predicting OD curves. It benefits from explicit growth inclusion, increasing biological interpretability.
Researchers have generated a whole-chromosome assembly of the beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. They identified ancestral linkage groups, termed "Stevens" elements, that share conserved genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beetles, but independent autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolve typical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-bi expression. Beetles provide a model to understand diverse forces driving sex evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a model to study kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing study kary evolution at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera but multiple formations of neo-sex among closely related species. Comparative analysis addresses prevalence patterns and evolutionary forces across species. Researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera, generating a new assembly for Tribium confum and published assemblies from eleven species spanning the phylogeny.

Chromosome sex determination is conserved across beet but unclear if sex identity is conserved. Dipt have XY chromosomes but genomic diversity in sex kotypes among flies. Beetle kary are inferred from testis squashes and reported as XY, X0, and Xy. Ancestral chromosome is conserved in some beet but not rigorously explored. Sex chromosomes follow evolutionary trajectories with Y losing genes and X evolving compensation. Researchers compared location of genes on scaffolds with T castum and found majority of X-linked genes correspond to LG in T castum. The ancestral sex identity is conserved across beet.
This study investigated the role of histone variant H2 Z in gene regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during DNA replication stress induced by hydroxyurea (H) exposure. H2 Z is encoded by the nonessential HT1 gene and is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR complex SW1, a conserved ATP-dependent chrom-remodel. While H Z has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW1 subunits, previous examining the role of H in gene regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW1 when its H substrate is missing. To explore this possibility, mRNA profiles were generated for wild, ht1, sw1, and ht1sw1 mutants before and after H exposure. Data showed H played a more prominent role in activation than repression during H exposure and its incorporation was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. Apo-SW1 contributed to gene defects in ht mutant, particularly for involved in phosphate regulation. Mapping H incorporation before and after treatment revealed decreases in enrichment at transcription sites correlated with, but not required, upregulation of genes during exposure. This study characterized the effects of H incorporation during transcriptional response to H.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to classify single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data into various cell types and identify lineage relationships using partial labeling, a method that uses a set of candidate labels per sample instead of a single label. This method, called partial learning, overcomes the challenge of annotating single-cell transcript profiles by hand due to the accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of data. They extended state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, k-NN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble, to the partial learning framework and studied the effect of incorporating label structure into the methods, focusing on hierarchical labels commonly observed in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these extensions enabled learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly with a prototype-based method. The performance of methods trained with partially annotated data reached that of fully supervised data. They also studied the level of uncertainty in partially annotated data and derived prescriptive results on the effect on accuracy of partial learning. The findings show hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning methods.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets, and its involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription. They found that P2 localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified proteins that associate with P2 in a higher RNA-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the RNA-dependent P2-associated (RD) proteome in human cells and found that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with basic P2-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These IDRs of RD proteins exhibit phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. They showed that Bromodomain protein 4 (BR4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions and altered P2 levels affect the number of BR4 protein foci. They propose that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins and affects their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing nuclear architecture for gene expression.
This study investigates the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae clade, through comparative genomics and developmental assays. Chromosome-level genome assemblies of three Onophagini species, Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, were compared to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying changes in coding and non-coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high and low-nutrition males and females revealed distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition and sex-responsive development, with a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and candidate transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-responsive chromatin regions. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides reference genomes for three species bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this group.
Researchers used a cynomolg monkey model to investigate the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV), and the mechanisms associated with survival or death. They found that lymphoid organs are an early reservoir for LASV replication, with the virus entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varies with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa, but systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types leading to inflammation and fatal outcome. The study provides new insight into viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease. 

The researchers developed a cynolg monkey model reproducing different outcomes of Lassa fever in humans, infecting animals with Josiah and AV strains of LAS at same dose and route leading to fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. They analyzed dynamics and tropism of these strains to shed light on pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. Lymphoid organs are early reservoir for LAS replication in all animals, with cell tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differing between outcomes. 

The replication in SLO is followed by systemic dissemination to all organs in severe fever, whereas restricted to few in surviving animals. LAS strains belonging to lineage 5 cause less disease than Josiah in cynolg monkeys. The aim was to characterize pathogenesis and immune responses with survival or death in cynolg model where AV leads to non-lethal and Jos results in death. Early replication occurs in skin adjacent to subcutaneous site, and events in SLO may determine later responses and outcome. IFα and γ, E, IL/J/STAT, G/M, IL/STAT, and complement pathways activated during fever, more intense after Josiah infection. 

Lassa is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa, with lethality 15-30%. LAS displays no spread in surviving, but systemic replication in fatal, leading cytokine storm and organ failure resembling septic syndrome. The discrepancy with natural infection does not alter course, lungs targeted with virus and pathological tropism reported in LAS-infected cynolg using aerosol.
Pathological disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mislocalization of nuclear pore proteins, transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP are seen in both familial and sporadic forms of these diseases. However, whether these alterations represent a primary cause or consequence of disease is unclear, and upstream factors accounting for defects are unknown. This study reports four key findings that shed light on the causal role of Import-β-specific transport in disease onset. Two mouse models of neurodegeneration, NemR86 and NemR87, recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases and show Import-β nuclear block. Cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran, are observed. Interaction between Importβ and mutant Nem86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations is seen. Transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease is identified. Transient inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal cells induces proteinies and transcription alterations seen in models. Convergent results between mouse and human cells provide mechanistic evidence that mislocalized proteins and transcription events in neurogener diseases arise from primary defect Importβ import.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of CRIS-Cas-based phage mutagenesis by temporarily reducing DNA modifications in the phage genome using the eukary enzyme NgET. This method enables precise targeting and seamless integration of point mutations, exemplified by deactivating specific AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. By temporally removing modifications, the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections were elucidated without necessitating gene deletions. The study presents a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining ph engineering with cytosine DNA modifications. Temporal modulation of the phage epigen is valuable for synthetic biology and research comprehending phage mechanisms through generation of mutants. The approach circumvents previous limitations and presents a novel strategy for precise site-specific ph mutagenesis based on reducing ph DNA modifications, enhancing accessibility for Cas nucleases and boosting efficiency of ph DNA double-strand breaks. The scarless nature of this approach allows studying the impact of introduced mutations on ph infection without side effects associated with deletion or gene insertion. Findings propose efficient introducing mutations into genomes of lytic phages with cytosine-based modifications. To assess the impact of NgET treatment on Cas-mediated engineering, two T phage-encoded genes were selected as targets, belonging to the class of AD-ribosyltransferases. During infection, they play a role in takeover control over E coli by T ph, though mechanisms not fully understood. NgET-treated T4 phages were infectious, evidenced by ability to infect and lyse wild-type E coli. The experiment showed treating T with NgET led to delayed lysis of E, importance of ph DNA for fitness. Building on this, CRPRas targeting ph DNA was enhanced due to NgET treatment. However, low mutagen efficiency was observed, dependent on spacer selected for mutagen, strongly reducing applicability of approach for ph mutagen.
A study in yeast identified histone variant H2 Z as a crucial for efficient transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER) following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. TCER is a DNA repair pathway that removes bulky lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. Without H2 Z, TCER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. H Z is needed for proficient TCER and plays a role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation. The study used a genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify H Z as a new player in TCER. Results support a role for this histone in regulation of RNA polymerase II occupancy and TCER efficiency upon UV irradiation. UV-irradiation of Z-depleted cells leads to accumulation of double-strand breaks, a threat to genome stability. H is the only histone conserved from yeast to human, while essential for mammalian development, not in yeast except conditions requiring transcriptional activation. Previous studies linked Z to DNA checkpoint, double-strand break repair, chromosome segregation, double-strand break resolution, and nucleotide excision repair.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindg, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two Drosoph melanogaster strains and their F hybrids from divergent populations: one from the European and one from the African range. Both transcript and microbiome data showed tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic effects. Examination of allele expression revealed cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in genes differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes, with trans effects more tissue-specific than cis. Despite highly variable architecture, trans effects were robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting expression variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during population divergence. Transcript data from parental and F hybrid D melanog strains showed genetic and mode of variation highly tissue and background-specific. The midut, hind, and Malian tub showed divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and backgrounds, with overall expression similar between Malian tub and midut, despite being part of excret and digestive system, while gut part alimentary canal. Tissue type had largest impact on microbial composition and diversity, with genetic affecting microbiome to lesser degree, especially hindut. Gene divergence within same genotype between midut and Malian tub was lower than between these and hindut. Microbiome sequencing showed tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue type having largest impact on community diversity and genetic affecting to lesser degree, especially hindut.
Researchers used a population dynamics approach to estimate the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China and the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK. They validated their model on simulated data and applied it to early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, estimating the first SARS-CoV-2 infection around November 28, 2019 (95% IPR: November 2-December 9, 201). The results fall within previously estimated ranges by genomic studies. The model is generic and can be applied to other outbreaks. The approach estimates the emergence of an epidemic as the date of the first infection leading to sustained transmission, using key epidemiological parameters and first reported cases. The study contributes to the literature on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 emergence, offering weight to estimates using different methodologies. The model was run on simulated data and applied to early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, estimating the first SARS-2 infection around November 28, 201 (95 IPR: November 2-9,201). The results fall close to previously published estimates. The model was also applied to the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK, estimating the first infection August 21,202 (95 IPR: July 23-September 5,202).
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to simulate the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in the presence of non-homous chromosomes. The model captures the dynamics of the entire chromosome ensemble, including attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between non-homous chromosomes. Simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome, and attractive forces come into play when homs are close. A repulsive force that shortens non-hous interactions is a key feature of the model, representing molecular processes that dissociate nonous chromosomes. The model allows analysis of individual trajectories throughout meiotic prophase, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of chromosomal parameters, including number, size, movement, and forces provide insights into their contributions to pairing. The model suggests hom pairing is achieved by two distinct processes: homs confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation with nonous via repulsive, and confinement enabling attractive forces. Simulations indicate disruptions due to collisions with nonous during incipient interactions of hom pairs. The model recapitulates kinetics of wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast and can be adapted to other organisms.
This study investigated the role of microRNA-34 (miR-34) in the zebraf, a model organism, in relation to the tumor suppressor gene TP53. mi-34 is a target of p53 and its expression is induced by DNA damage. However, mi-34-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer development, but lack of mi-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 genes are conserved and syntenic between zraf and humans. Zraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar expression in development, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage by camptecin led to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants were viable and had normal damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, mi-34- compound with gain-function p53R217/217 or p53- mutants were more cancer-prone than p53 mutants, confirming tumor-suppressive of mi-34. Transcriptomic comparisons at 28 post-fertilization (pf) characterized DNA-induced, and at 28 and 72pf determined mi-34-regulated genes. At 72pf, loss mi-34 enhanced erythrocyte levels and upregulated my-positive hematietic stem. Overexpression mi-34 suppressed reporter, not p53 induction and sensitized embryos to camptec but not γ-irradiation. 

The study found that zraf mi-34 and mi-34/c are primarily dependent on p53 for induction under DNA conditions and partially on p53 for baseline expression. Direct evidence of mi-34 tumor-suppressive was provided by earlier onset in mi-34 and p53 mutants compared to single p53. Transient overexpression mi-34 induced sensitivity in zraf embryos to camptec but not γiradiation. Despite mi- loss not affecting p genes, evaluated mi- effects in p mutant zraf given epigenetic silencing MIR in humans TP mutant contributes cancer. Employed tp- and tpR217/217 as mutant and generated homozygous mi-34- tp- tp- and mi34- tpR217/217 compound lines. Expression mi- is partially on p under conditions and by DNA is fully p-dependent. Found mi- has small transcriptomic effects 28pf zraf under control and damage.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of XOL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and males. In males, XOL-1 is highly expressed, while in hermrodites, X-1 is expressed at low levels. X-1 activity is critical for proper C. elegans male development, but its low expression was considered minimal in hermrod development. This study reveals X- plays a role in regulating developmental timing in hermrod embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division and developmentally advanced transcription when X- is lost. Further analysis shows X- regulates initiation of dosage on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription in hermrod. X- mutant embryos overexpress H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and altered H3me. Some effects of X- loss were reversed by MET- These findings demonstrate X plays a developmental role in both sexes and MET as downstream of X- in hermrod.

 X- represses S proteins in males, which regulate sex and dosage in herm. The ratio differs between C eleg sexes, hermrod have two X, while males have one. Xs and ASE compete to repress and activate X in early, due to lower X ratio in males, X is activated. This study confirms X is transcribed in herm early but shows loss results in significant transcriptional changes. X mutant show accelerated herm development and precocious establishment of dosage and sex pathways.

 X is a sensor that toggles on or off depending on X and autos signal. Elements on X, such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39, and fox-1, are X signal (SE) and on autos, such as sea- and sea-2 are autosome elements (ASE). These regulate embryonic development and timing of sex-specific programs. Disruption results in acceleration and developmental pathways. X is responsible for repressing herm sex in XO, hypothesized X mutant would upregulate involved in herm sex in early. Conversely, X activates male pathways, hypothesized loss would downregulate involved embryonic sex.

 X adultmrod look healthy, superficially similar to WT. X is required to potentiate pathways leading to sperm structures in adult. Measured brood counts X mutant and WT. X continue to decline but detectable late embry when obtain morphology. Genes disrupt developmental tend to embryonic or larval lethality. Performed embryonic lar viability assays.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurveillance (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of traps for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations to minimize the time to detect an allele of interest. The framework takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit, such as resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food and breeding sites) and movement between resources on the landscape. It also accommodates traps with differing attractiveness profiles. MGSurveillance is intended for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. The authors demonstrate the application of MGSveillance to distribute traps to minimize the time to detect an allele of interest for Ae. aegypt populations in a suburb in Queensland, Australia, and Anopheles gambia on the island of São Tomé, São and Princ. The framework uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize trap placement, implemented by the DEAP framework. The GA is a subset of evolutionary algorithms that search solution space using biologically operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection. The authors provide functions to analyze and visualize results from the trap optimization, including landscape reports and plots of optimal trap placement alongside mosquito population distribution. MGSurveillance is a tool to detect unintended spread of gene drive alleles beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant or non-effector genes within sites. It can also detect new alleles conferring resistance to interventions, such as bednets or insecticides. The authors conclude that early detection is critical to minimizing impact, preserving possibility of elimination, and maximizing cost-effectiveness of programs.
Symbonas scillans, a tiny (1.4 μm) heterotrophic eukaryote, was previously reported to harbor endosymb bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, the identity and functional role of these endobacteria were unknown. To investigate, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting various bacterial groups and amplification-free metagenomics and whole-genome sequencing of two strains of S. scillans showed the absence of endob of knownosymb lineages. The absence of endosymb bacteria in the sequencing was further supported by the absence of bacterial signal in FISH of subcultures of S. scill grown in Canada (RCC257) and Japan (RCC-257p). 

Sequencing of two geographically distinct strains (RCC24 from Pacific and CC257 from Atlantic) under culture conditions showed a large representation of host sequence as expected. The exception was WGA from CC where no host could be identified. Due to loss of viral in CC-late and complete loss of CC strain, could not conduct infection assay or purify lysates. However, given sequence of proriral reads, completeness BVM, lack of evidence green in cultures, and sample method, argue SVs are directly with S. scill. This is supported by similar but distinct of S. All assembled W data no were assigned to Archaea, while ampl-free metome had Archae contigs with low. Instead endob, contigs to pror with up 200 in CC (S Fig S Dataset). 

The giant virus-like particle (VLP) from CC was visualized with negative TEM. V exhibited icosahedral with diameter 192 nm, large compared to characterized pror. However, within range 180-240 of described endob in S scill. Labzia spp, Hyomon spp were reported in cultures Ostococcus, Symbini, Alexandrium, discids [54-60]. Accounting overwhelming culture-associated, subset whole-genome (W) data selected reas lower GC, associated endosion. However, sequences to endymb lineages detected. Hyomon spp, Balola, Marinumic, Phispha, no endymb line nor draft genomes withos features such as small size, AT-rich, rapid evolution identified.
The leiom (MOD) family of actin-binding proteins play a crucial role in muscle function, and mutations in three family members (MOD1-3) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant isoform MOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no MOD protein is expressed. This study shows that nonsense-mediated decay, a mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides were generated to obstruct the exon complex, preventing nonsense decay of MOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant expression. Investigation lays groundwork for therapeutic intervention in MOD-linked myopathies.

 Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in MOD3, isoform in skeletal, result nemal myopathy, a muscle disorder by weakness. Disease mutations found in cardiac-predant iso MOD2. First case of MOD2 mutation (W*) results in severe neon dilated cardiopathy. MOD protein not detected in explanted heart via western blot, RT-PCR revealed decrease in MOD2 levels, no change preRNA. Hypothesized nonsense decay underlies loss mutant expression. Two MOD disease-causing mutations (R* and LV*) associated with dilated cardiopathy lack MOD protein through decay. Developed steric oligonucleotides to inhibit decay MOD, increasing mutant-truncated protein.

Multiple MOD mutations with dilated cardiopathy lead lack MOD expression through decay. Developed experimental system to test effect MOD disease mutations on MOD expression and stability. Four MOD mutations discovered in individuals with early dilated cardiopathy. Analyzed explanted hearts, two mutations (W and R) result in large decrease protein when constructs containing introns. Significant loss mutant not due defect protein level. Research needed determine extent decay, effectiveness oligonucleotides patient-derived cardiocytes.
Apolipoprotein E (Apo) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with Apo4 increasing and Ap2 decreasing relative to the control Ap3. To investigate how Apo isoforms alter risk, we measured proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human Apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. We identified 484 proteins and tested Apo iso-dependent changes in homeostatic regulation ~270 ontologies. In the brain, Ap4 and Ap2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type Ap3. Ap4 lacks cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing quality. Ap2 proteins of the matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had increased degradation, suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. In the liver, we did not observe these changes, suggesting the Apo-effect proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology.

Compared to Ap3, expression Ap4 increases Alzheimer's risk, while Ap2 is protective. We investigated Apo-dependent changes in protein homeostasis in tissues of human-Apo transgenic mice. Proteasis is the control of concentration and quality in the cell. We demonstrated combining protein and turnover unveils cellular regulation synthesis and degradation. Utilizing proteomics, we compared ontology variations due Ap genotypes in healthy mice. Our findings in vivo evidence harmonize with literature, linking Ap4-dependent changes endosomal, autagy, proteome, and mitochondrial quality. Concurrently, data suggest Ap2 enhances mitochondrial by turnover in tandem with increase proteolysis in the brain.

Ap2 and 4 modulate disease relative Ap3. For example, Ferr et al. observed ~5 increase Alzheimer Disease prevalence in Ap4 carriers relative Ap3 and decreased risk ~0.5 in Ap2 carriers. Our findings substantiate Ap4 dysregulation M structures, potentially disrupted morphology and impaired production. We hypothesize Ap4 reduces autagy and proteas activity, eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria. Ap is a lipid transporter throughout the body, not just brain. We applied kinetic model combining turnover and data reveal Ap iso-dependent regulation synthesis and degradation. Investigated liver and brain, with strong evidence major apolipoproteins, only ApA crosses the barrier. Chemically identical Ap is found separate pools.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila. The toolkit, called CRPRTRM, uses tissue-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitously expressed gRNAs to knock out genes in the desired tissue. The researchers validated the efficacy of CRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. They used CRTRM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance and found that the ESC pathway suppresses NMJ bout growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Additionally, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NM. The researchers successfully developed an NM CRPR mutagenesis approach to reveal genes for NM structural plasticity.
In Drosophila larvae, the lymph gland contains a pool of progenitor cells that accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is essential for their differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase), upregulating fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Using expression, genetic, and pharmacological approaches, we found that Dophila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor from metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing activation of J. ROS serves as metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. Our study sheds light on how NFκ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways crucial regulating cell fate during development.

 Rel is expressed in embryonic lymph and larval progenitor pool, and overexpression leads to downregulation of FA. Negative regulation of NFκ signaling on fatty oxidation has been reported in various conditions. ROS levels in blooditor cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation, and J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. Our study reveals Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and decreases as they move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel leads to activation of J, coaxing to differentiate. Rel inhibits TAK to dampen J activation, preventing precocious differentiation of ROS-rich myel-like progenitors. NF regulates hematopoies through transcription genes in H fate and plays role in H emergence from endothelium. The process shares similarities with vertebrates, and myoid progenitors are enriched ROS.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. This study reports a patient with T features but no pathogenic variants found in RNUAT, instead, the homozygous RT c.295A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on RT function, centrosome engineered RT-depleted cells and patient fibroblasts, neural stem cells (NS) derived CRPR/C9-edited pluripotent cells revealed cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities leading aneuplo, cycle arrest cell death. Cortical organoids discovered additional function RT in self-organisation NS into neural rotes, observing delayed ap-basal polarization NS. These defects contributed delay roset formation RT-mated organoids, thus impeding growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading microceph.

The RT.295A variant alters splicing site of intron 23, confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. This study investigated pathophys mechanisms associated with RT.295A variant in patient fibrobl, iPSC-derived models. Patient with T-like features, no RNUAT variants, wholeome sequencing revealed homozyg pathogenic missense NM RT.295A, altering splicing. RT has been implicated in disease, microceph, short stature, and microgy with seizure (MSS, OM #614). Patient fibro, engineered RPE cells, CR9-ed pluripotent stem (iPSC) differentiated neural stem (NS) cortical organoids (CO) analyzed impact RT isoforms resulting mutated allele cellular studies centome complex functions. Results establish RT.295A variant affects neural cell pool, leading improper cell mass patients.
Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase (LT). In 2015, a set of experiments was initiated to characterize the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LT. Populations of E. coli were allowed to grow on fresh media but not provided with new resources. Whole genome sequencing of hundreds of clones at 12 time points spanning six years revealed novel aspects of adaptation. E coli continuously adapts up to six years through convergent accumulation of mutations. Lineages are established upon entry into LT, convergent with similar lineages across populations. High parallelism with adaptations under LT, combined with LT populations' structure enable to screen for loci displaying significant association of mutations, suggestive of contingency. Associations are frequent, third of converently loci involved in at least one. Results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallel and frequent contingency.
Researchers have investigated the regulation of translation of the iab-8 transcript, a non-coding RNA in Drosophila melanogaster. The i-8 transcript is expressed in the central nervous system and produces a microRNA that represses translation of genes, including abd and Ubx. A shorter version of this transcript, male-specific (MSA), codes for a peptide MSi that mediates sperm usage in mated females. However, MSi is not detected in the CNS where i-8 is expressed, suggesting a repressive mechanism prevents its translation. The difference between MSA and i-8 lies in their first exons, with MSA containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that prevent downstream translation. Cell culture and transgenic analysis show that uORs in the 5 exons of i-8 prevent production of proteins from downstream ORFs. The uFs are conserved in Dophila and may prevent creation of spurious ab-A protein or have a biological function in their own right. The primary function of i-8 is production of i- miRNA, which is important for repressing translation of target genes, including abd and Ubx. Using ribosome immunoprecitation and GFP-ins, MS serves as template for small peptide MSi, which regulates sperm usage in fertilized females. However, GFP fusions were not detected in CNS where i8 is expressed, suggesting uOR prevent translation.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CD) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. Loss-of-function mutations in glycosylation genes lead to CD. Because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms CD can affect most systems. The CD are likely connected because they affect protein glycos and show similar symptoms in patients, suggesting common modifiers may affect multiple CD. We used evolutionary tools to analyze glycos genes and identify modifiers for all CD genes. High ERC between N-glycosylation and GPI synthesis suggest unexplored connections between pathways. ERC occur when proteins under evolutionary constraints. 50 glycos proteins in top-scoring pairs are associated with CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for modifiers. Top scores revealed ERC between PIG and U20 (10.33) and PIGN W36 (9.74). Glycos is conserved from yeast to mammals, allowing strong signals to develop over time. Identified modifier genes for CD have ERC, including PM2PM (7.08) and DPTDPM (4.17). In vivo testing top hits from analysis had a hit rate (10/16) higher than found in ERC studies (5/16 and 12/34). ERC identifies proteins with evolutionary that covary CD, potentially genetic modifiers. Recent studies suggest glycos genes modify CD genes. A study examined PM2CD patients and identified a variant AL6, N-glycos gene segregating with severe outcomes. Patients with same CD and disease-causing variant show phenotyp variability, indicating genetic background and environment influence presentation. Current options CD are limited, focusing management. Identifying modifiers glycos could lead new targets. We calculated ERC for N-glycos across the genome and ran same as for GPI synthesis. Among cytoplasm proteins, three were underrepresented, four overrepresented. ERC between GPI synthesis and N-gcos showed exceptionally high scores, possibly shared reliance on mannose.
The HBV core protein (HBc) contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and arginine-rich C-terminal (C) domain for genomic RNA (pg) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of HBc, especially at Ser and Ser, is essential for nucleation with polymerase (Pol) to initiate pg encapsidation. As caps mature, HBc undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting involvement of a phosphatase in late encapsation stage. Using C-S antibody for nonosphorylated HB-Ser, a transition from phosphorylated to deosphory state during pg packaging was observed. Pol-dependent deosphory of HBer was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val in RNase domain, abolishing deory of HBer. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and structural analyses showed recruitment of host phosphat PP dependent on Pol domain. This recruitment does not HB but require Pol via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory of HBer is essential for pg encapsation completion and associated with endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs). HB may play dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion packaging. Findings elucidate mechanism Pol-mediated deory of HB regulates pg encapsulation and reveal PP as potential target for antiviral development.
This study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. The researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivorous bivalves from the genera Codak and Cten (Lucinidae) on either side of the Isth, to investigate how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbion and their metabolic capabilities. They found that lucin sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazropha symbts, with those from the Caribbean having the potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of fixation under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nHDK operon revealed the last ancestor of Ca Thiazro lacked n genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats required the n operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests H of the n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade, highlighting the importance of nitrogen in ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbion species and the role of bacterialion in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers identified 9,291 TASRs from 661 vertebrate genomes, revealing that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TASR content compared to other vertebrates. Most TASRs are found in clusters, with amphibians having more clusters and genes per cluster than other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis shows that TASRs diverged after major vertebrate lineages were established, with most amphibians forming four major groups and several small groups. The TASR repertoire is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xenobiotics. The TASR count is stable in most lineages, with one-to-one orthologs between closely related species. The number of receptors not in the tongue is directly proportional to the number of TASRs in the genome, suggesting gene subfunctionalization. Gene mining across vertebrates indicates a rapid TASR expansion in frogs and salanders, leading to a wider repertoire than other lineages. Transcriptome analysis of seven tissues in five amphib species shows most TASRs are expressed in the tongue, but also in other tissues. The TASRs in amphibians detect not only bitter compounds known to vertebrates but also substances relevant to their ecology. The TASRs are considered specialized chemosensors, emphasizing their functions beyond oral taste.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in intestinal stem cell maintenance and function in mice with Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) alleles. They found that NDD mice are sensitized to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts. Quantitative MS/MS analysis in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2 or NOT2 revealed an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction of NOT2 with transcription machinery but preserved with HD2 interactome. HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (V) prevented intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma-secretase inhibitors in mice spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation program in stem cells. Not dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about proteome environment with consequences to innate immunity. HD3 interacts with NIC1 regulating stability and activity. Not activation expands stem niche at expense of goblet and entero cells. NDD mice show environmentally modulated susceptibility to DSS and decrease in colonic cells. The study used NDD model to investigate role of N dimer in intestinal colonic cells. NDD mice lose colonic cells when challenged with 1% D, a dose tolerated by wild controls. To test loss of Nimer affects col cells autonomously, colon spher cultures were established devoid of immune components and passaged in vitro. Spher N mice show genes associated with defense against symbion and interferon targets, consistent with elevated col epithelium immunity. Mechanistically, monomer activities of NIC remain unchanged in N mice but d-dependent transcription affected. RNAseq from soids did not identify differential d-dependent targets, instead overall reduction in function such as proliferation and barrier.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection to account for the effects of migration in an island model, showing that migration, in addition to selection and recombination, acts to break the cross-gener association between a neutral and deleterious alleles. In cases where migration rates are comparable or stronger than the strength of selection against deleter alleles, deleter alleles emigrate from local populations at an appreciable rate prior their removal via selection. The effects of background on FST are significantly attenuated under non-trivial migration rates, with greater reductions in π and π. A novel derivation of the effects of background in an island model accounts for the effects of migration, providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of background by truncating crossener associations between neutral and deleter alleles in reproductive success. Theoretical predictions support the expectation that background weakly confounds locus-locus F scans when gene flow is common. Simulations show that background can cause substantial reductions in π despite weak effects on F, particularly in metapopulations with larger effective size. The work extends the theory of background into structured populations and suggests background will minimally confound locus-locus F scans.
Researchers have developed a federated genetic testing tool, FedGAT, to perform association studies while correcting for confounding and polygenic effects among collaborating sites without sharing genetic data. FedAT uses a federated statistical approach and homomorphic encryption to protect intermediate statistics. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves results similar to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. However, federated studies have challenges, such as designing harmonized data collection and covariates, may lead sites to perform meta-analyses sharing summary statistics, reducing computational burden and privacy concerns. Previous research focused on secure GWAS, adopting feder methods like χ2 test, PCA, and logistic regression, but lacked correcting polygenic effects due to complexity. FedAT integrates random effects in different designs without algorithm changes, an advantage from efficient testing GAT formulation. FedAT uses two-step testing and homomorphic encryption to protect statistics aggregated in feder setting, increasing data sharing and protection. Despite regulations like HIPAA, sharing raw data is restricted, FedAT provides unbiased results with large sample sizes and diverse populations. FedAT and Chen-Edalli's method have different advantages, contributing to the literature. Zhu et al developed a federated generalized mixed model for GWAS, one of the first to perform mixed testing. Privacy concerns hinder high-powered GW studies, requiring large samples, leading to data siloed and underutilization due to concerns. Regulations like HIPAA and GDPR protect health records, including genetic data. FedAT modularizes the problem in stages, enabling tiered privacy design for GW.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk, including prostate cancer, by combining multiple genetic variants into a single score. However, these models have not been formally assessed for their performance in prostate cancer, particularly in diverse populations. This study benchmarked six widely used PRS algorithms, four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts, and found modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants and clumping. The findings underscore the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. 

PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening may reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with PSA alone. However, given ancestry-associated PC incidence and outcome biases, it is crucial that scores work equally across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluated performance of published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort, finding no differences in cancer or risk factors such as year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol. Publicly poly risk scores were evaluated in the dataset, trained on allelic scoring of risk and first 10 genetic components with cross-validation, regardless of population. Predictive models improved with integration of age and poly score, similar to findings in UKob, addition of family and BMI did not increase power. The utility of scores from UKob dataset shows genetic coupled with age sufficient to predict cancer. 

The study evaluated poly scores in clinical utility, fitting a model with top PRs, age, assessment, PC history, and BMI, which improved prostate prediction in population manner. The addition of age significantly increased AUROC of PR-only model. Given diversity in incidence and outcome across ancestry, poorly risk tools may compromise stratification and care, particularly those likely afflicted. The work highlights need for algorithms to predict across populations and sampling diverse cohorts.
Researchers used a Drosila model of DPAG1-CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, to identify potential therapeutics. They screened 1,520 FDA-approved drugs and found 42 that improved the model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor partially rescued the model, suggesting dopamine signaling is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. Loss of dopamine synthesis or recycling also partially rescued the model. This links dopamine to glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1-CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine drugs, CO inhibitors, and NK1. These and analyses reveal novel biology of DP1 mechanisms and may represent new options for DP1CD. The Drosila eye is used to study biological processes, including development, and the DP1 model resulted in a 65% knockdown of DP1 expression. Loss of D2 partially rescued the DP1 model, but to a lesser extent than loss of D2 on its own. This is in line with opposing effects of D1 and D on cAMP signaling. The study suggests manipulating DA signaling is a therapy for DP1CD and implicates a role of DA on glycosylation. Compounds identified in the screen are potential therapeutic interactions with DP1 and may be new options for DP1CD.
Researchers developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA) to model the representation of proprioception in the somatosensory cortex. The model was trained on natural human movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey studies: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates and the distribution of preferred directions (PD) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model predicts that encoding across the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs and few neurons encode a single joint. The model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and the basis for neural manifolds with applications to restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of robots. 

The model learns to translate proprio inputs into a latent representation of proprioception read as neural firing. It has minimal bias regarding particular sensory modality and can generalise to other regions of cortex. Proprioceptive areas are critical for goal-directed behaviour but the principles of proprio cortical coding are unclear. The model relates kinematics to proprio encoding and compares to single-unit recordings from monkeys. A novel model predicts neural coding and organisation across cortex. The topoVA model is a deep network that learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs to cortical latent space of spiking neurons embodying a stochastic generative model of movement-related activity. It hypothesises the cortex learns through experience an efficient representation of the somensory world. 

The model makes predictions about the nature of proprio coding one of which is partially validated with limited data. Future work includes identifying constraints to reproduce neural data from proprio cortex. The model finds structure akin to pinwheels of the visual cortex representing movement instead of orientation selectivity. Proprio representations are characterised at two levels: spatial curves of individual neurons and organisation of tuning maps across cortical surface. The model combines proprio stimuli with novel organisation of neurons in somensory cortex to develop understanding of proprio coding.
Researchers investigated the role of ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the perspective of microbes. They found that Azospirillum brasil, a plant-associated bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AER1) that directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduced biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters colonization density and metabolism of A. brasil, indicating the bacterium adapts upon sensing ethylene. This study provides new targets to regulate plant-micro interactions. Ethylene receptors have been well-stud in plants but not extensively in non-plant species. Azo1 is a functional ethylene receptor affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Phylogen analyses indicate putative eth receptors in bacterial phyla, including non-pathogenic proteobacteria associated with plants. Most studies on eth in planticro associations focused on micro-induced eth levels or signaling in plants. This study demonstrates A1 affects bacterial traits in stress and colonization, first in proteobacter. Eth inhibits biofilm formation and aggregation. Ethylene sources include plants and bacteria, and A. brense uses eth as a signal to communicate. Lower nitrogen increases A1 abundance, decreasing eth sensitivity. A1 contains a putative sigma factor binding site mediating response. Manipulating eth in plants or application affects plant health and microbes.
Researchers investigated the role of the IN80 protein in regulating gene silencing on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested a role in the meiotic body. Subsequent deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, and active RNA polymerase II at sex chromosomes of IN80 pachene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex genes. The recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex inhibition (MSCI) was reduced, suggesting IN80-facilitated recruitment of DNA factors for silencing sex genes. This role is independent of common IN80 target H2A. Instead, IN80 reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes. Data suggest a role IN80 in DNA factor localization, facilitating silencing sex genes during pachema.

 IN80 interacts and regulates sex gene silencing in pene spermatocytes, promoting chromatin opening during zyema-pachema transition at DSB regions. Chromatin accessibility is central to DNA repair and transcription. IN80 regulates somatic silencing autosomes in spermat by H3me3 modification, while H4 remains unaffected. IN80 silencing sex genes meiotic is independent of IN direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor recruitment at promoter-prox areas.

IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB sex regions, independent of histone H2. IN80 interacts DSBR factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment sex during pachema. Immunofluorescence IN80 pene spermatocytes staining on sex chromosomes. Chromatinoprecipitation sequencing IN80 showed binding on sex. IN80 occurred zene and pene stages on autos and sex. IN binding corroborates MSCI pene IN80KO spermat. Several studies described roles for M-regulating factors. IN80 DNA response in somatic and meiosis. IN80 interacts damage factors γ2 X and MEC at D repair sites yeast.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the axon regeneration pathway is activated by SV-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasogen family. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an HGF growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease for larval development. However, it is unclear how SV-1 is converted from a protease to growth factor for axon. This study demonstrates that cytidine deaminase CDD-2 plays a role in the conversion of SV-1. The codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His catalytic triad of SV-1 suppresses the c-2 defect in axon regeneration. The stem structure around His-755 in sv- mRNA is required for activation of axon by SV-1. Results suggest C- promotes ax regeneration by transforming SV- from prote to growth through modification of sv- mRNA. C- is required for axon by converting SV- from protease to growth. The study investigated the relationship between c- and sv- in regulation of axon and show that C is essential for ax regeneration. The pathway is activated by signaling involving mammalian H-like factor SV- and its tyrosine kinase SV. SV- is essential for regeneration but not development. SV has a Kringle, N-terminal related plasmin activation and serine domain. SV has dual function, acts as H growth to promote ax and plmin-like prote required lar. However, is unclear how SV can function growth despite intact catalytic. Must be a mechanism that converts SV from prote to growth in ax. The study demonstrates C- converts function of SV from prote to growth. Genetic results suggest- deamates sv- to U, replacing His- (CA) with Tyr (AU) in Asp-His catalytic, producing prote-inactive and growth-active SV. The Tyr form SV loses prote activity but gains growth.
Researchers explored the possibility of controlling collective behavior in biological systems by modifying the characteristics of constituents at the bottom-up level, using zebraf as a model organism. They genetically modified zraf with a homozygous deleterious mutation in the col11a gene (col2/-), which caused vertebral defects, compromised swimming, and slower reorientation. The mutants exhibited less orientational noise, modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. A group of 25 mutant zraf showed more collective motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured the behavior of wild and mutant zraf, with mutants modeled by self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning biological systems by changing state with simple matter. 

The study used zraf, with well-established collective behavior, monitored by tracking individual fish and amenable to genetic modification. Collective behavior can be compared to active matter models encapsulating fish properties, interactions, and environment. The col/-raf exhibited vertebral defects, less bending, and slower reorientation, captured by Vic model with modified orientational rule, attributed to vertebral defects. The mutants showed abnormal skeletal development, vertebral fusions, and intervertebral ruptures, expected to change zraf dynamics compared to wildtype. Knocking out cola changed zraf at individual level, regulating collagen expression, leading to vertebral and interverte defects. 

Phenotyping identified changes in bone and cartilage, micro-computed tomography of 6-month-old zraf provided 3d reconstruction of skeleton. Single-fish features measured phenotypic response to genetic. This study followed biological path by single-fish behavior and bone structures. The linkage between macroscopic (polarization) and microscopic (spinal defects, changed posture) controlled by genetic was first reported, explained by modified Vic model, longer persistence mapped to lower reorientation. The vertebral abnormality contributed to reduced flexibility in mutants, limited bending while swimming, observed in 3 environment. Observations characterized structural differences between mutants and wildtype, supporting biological foundation for behavioral differences.
Researchers developed a hybrid model to simulate short-term in vitro capillary network formation, using the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration and morphology, and continuum to quantify biog deformation and VEG transport. The model bridged mechanical and chemical stimulation, showing good agreement between predicted topology and experimental results, with elongated cells forming networks and cobble-like aggregates. Capillary development relied on adequate biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient for endothelial cues. Cellular network formed when mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously.

The model encompassed mechanical and chemical cues for capillary formation, covering VEG mechanisms on endothelial cells. Soluble VEG induced morphological changes, and bound VEG provided oriental signals, both forming capillary networks. Results revealed necessity of soluble and bound VEG in network development. Capillary grew and maintained stability when both VEG forms worked. Canceling soluble VEG effects hindered cord connection in early stage. Increasing VEG amount increased both soluble and bound VEG concentration, playing significant effect.

The model focused on interactive parameters: cell force, biel, and VFs. Strength of cell traction regulated biel responses adhesion. Omitting soluble VEG results, network features consistent with experimental data. Initially, cells spread, biel and VEG uniform, then migrated, formed cords, and enclosed lacunae. Present model ignored VEG transport hindered by attached cells. VEG diffusion and binding rates on cell surface as free. Hampered V concentration biel surface lower regions attached cells contact medium. Elongated cells connected, lined cords, cobble aggregates. Computed distribution, biel density, and VEG concentration through formation. Strong correlation between cells, biel, and VEG, positive loop among cells, bi,el, and VEG.
This study investigates the role of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) ligands in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans' immune response to bacterial pathogens. The five TGF-β ligands in C. elegans are DB-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, T-2, and T-3, which are classified into two subfamilies: bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF/β/Activ. The study shows that all five TGF ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, with DB-1, a BMP-like ligand, and T-2, a BMP-like ligand, acting independently, while T-2/B and T-3, a TGF/Activ-like ligands, function together. Structural analysis suggests that T-2 and T-3 can form heterodimers. The study also identifies T-2 and-3 as a subset of TGF ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. The canonical BMP pathway is required for response to pathogens, including the Type receptor SMA-6 and Smads SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4, while T/Activ pathway components have minimal effects. The study demonstrates non-additive relationship between BMP and T/Activ ligands, suggesting interaction in a common pathway.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat is shown to be involved in the response to DNA damage, with cells lacking Nat exhibiting increased sensitivity and accumulation of DNA breaks compared to wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. The study reveals that Nat's effects on the damage cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H4, with Nat-deleted cells displaying lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph and diminished binding of the checkpoint protein Rad9 surrounding double-strand breaks. Additionally, Mec1 recruitment to double-strand breaks, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat-deleted cells, resulting in reduced Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad53 indicative of damage activation. The study highlights a novel link between histone N-terminal acetylase Nat and the DDR, associating a hist-modifying activity in genome integrity maintenance.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct cancer phylogenies, which depict the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells in cancer, from bulk DNA sequencing data. Existing methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover phyeny altogether. Orchard uses a factorized approximation of the posterior over phylogen, a novel result derived in this paper, and optimizes each factor sequentially generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogen that culminates in a complete tree containing all mutations. Evaluations demonstrate Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art phylogeny reconstruction in reconstructing more plausible phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogen using up 1,000 mutations. Large and accurate phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations. The algorithm alleviates the need to pre-cluster mutations and solves MS problems with as many as 100 mutations and 100 samples. Benchmark reconstructions against Pair and CAL on 14 B-proitor lymphoblastic leukemias and 90 cancers show Orchard can match or beat ground-truth baselines on reconstruction with up to 300 mutations and 100 samples. Orchard can recover larger trees on simulated data and reconstruct 100-node mutation trees in 26 hours.
Researchers have developed Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MHC immunogenic prediction and integrates T cell receptor (TCR) information. Immugen comprises a MHC encoding module trained on multiple MHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding, and a set of context-specific immunogenic prediction modules. Compared to state-of-the-art models, Immugen performs comparably on MHC affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability tasks, and outperforms on MHC immunogenic prediction with a 7% increase in average precision. Immugen shows improved performance on immunogenic prediction with integration of TCR information. The model's performance is analyzed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing immunogenic models and biases in public datasets. Immugen is designed as a modular approach for immunogenic prediction, allowing additional features to be added to the input classification head, with T specificity performed using peptide:HLA:TCR triplets as input. The MHC module processes peptide:HL input with immunogenic classification fine-tuned with T-based inputs. Immugen provides a framework for immunogenic prediction using a protein model achieving state-the performance on publicly available CD8 reactivity data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based analysis with whole-genome sequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness. They identified a 6.24 kb QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) region on chromosome 15 (G15: 629.34-630.58 kb) associated with lightness and redness. The protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was found to be significantly associated with meat color (P = 8.65E-08). The causal relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness was further validated through Mendelian randomization analysis (P < 2.9E-12). Skeletal muscle-specific PPP1 knockout (PPP-SS) mice were generated and showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in limb muscles. Myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fastwitch. Transcript and metabolome analysis revealed inhibition of PPP1 decreased slow-twitch myiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay revealed a SNP (rs520, C > T) in PPP intron could regulate transcription. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, and rs520 variant expression were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. PPP1 was identified as causative for color and a novel gene variant for meat improvement.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to identify the functional subunits within a ganglion cell's receptive field in the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently locate and reconstruct the subunits. Simulations demonstrate that STR can identify subunits across various model variations and experimental recordings of primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. The technique can reveal sub layouts in a few minutes, making it ideal for online and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure in retina. 

The STR method uses the center-sur structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen sub responses and superolve them below the scale of subunits, allowing tomographic reconstruction of sub. A simplified gang cell model was extended to test STR in a realistic setting, combining principles of stimulated emission microscopy and computed tomography. The technique was investigated via electrophysiological recordings from primate ganglion cells. Rapid sub identification leaves time to use sub layouts for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. Knowing sub locations, stimuli can be manufactured to characterize spatiemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic of each sub, and their similarity across sub within gang cell field. Interactions between bipolar cells were taken into account, an alternative method might locate sub more consistently, reduce effects in reconstruction, and determine sub shape accurately.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical method called CRPR-DR to identify genes that interact with drugs in chemical-genetic interactions (CGI) experiments. The method incorporates both drug concentration and sgRNA efficiency in a modified dose-response equation to capture non-linear interactions between them. CRPRDR requires multiple sgRNAs for each target, varying in strength, and actual efficiencies empirically quantified by growth defects. The approach is applied to a Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset and E. coli growth on different carbon sources, outperforming related methods in precision and accuracy. CRPRDR extends previous work by showing effects of drug and sgRNA can be accommodated in same model. Ideally, interacting genes would exhibit synergistic behavior with drug, where depletion induces excess or enrichment of mutants in presence of inhibitor, concentration-dependent. The main requirements for CRPRDR are multiple sgRNAs for each target, varying strength, and actual efficiencies empirically quantified prior to analysis. The primary case focus is chemical-genetic interactions with drug as covariate. In CGI experiments, variable sgRNA can identify genes whose depletion synergizes with increasing concentration. The CRPR model incorporates sgRNA and drug as parameters, capturing non-linear interaction where "slopes" for effect drug on mutants can be larger for intermediate sgRN, while flatter for high or low efficiency. This contrasts with selecting strongest or weakest sgRN for synergy. CRDR is applicable to libraries with multiple sgRN for each gene, quantified by growth defects. The diversity is useful for identifying synergistic effects.
Researchers developed a community detection method called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM) that does not assume genes are organized into assortative modules. They applied SBM to RNA gene expression data from two tissues in an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population and found it identified ten times more groups than competing methods that assume modularity. Several of these groups were not modular and had strong functional enrichment. This suggests the transcriptome is more complex than thought and modularity is not the main driver of structuring gene-expression. Non-modular blocks are widespread in gene networks and their functional relevance is as strong as modular. This highlights the need to incorporate beyond modularity when exploring biological networks. Methods like graphical LASSO are used in this context and may provide better estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. Combining community detection with network inference can inform each other. The SBM was compared to weighted gene co-expression analysis (WNA) that relies on modularity. SB found more groups and non-assortative blocks in Drosila head and body RNA datasets. Modularity and assortativity are lower in body than head tissue. The degree of modularity can be quantified in a continuous scale to compare networks. Gene-expression informs cell and organism function by encoding associations between genes. Associations indicate common function and connections point central genes.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly ( )-binding protein (PAB) in yeast, which is involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation, initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. They used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and riboSeq to analyze the abundance of components of the yeast proteome and transcriptome in cells lacking the P1 gene. The results showed drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination in P1 cells. The defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in P cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of deadenylation complex, in addition to the loss of P's direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of P manifested a nonsense codon readthrough indicative of a defect in termination. The results indicate that loss of P is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcription regulation.
This study explores an alternative mechanism for generating slow brain rhythms, such as those seen in slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, in neurons with class I excitability. The mechanism is based on the interplay between fast-spiking dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Bifurcation analysis of the system reveals a hysteres loop around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node bifurcation, common in class I excitable neurons. Depending on Na+/ATPase strength, bursts are generated through pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The study suggests transitions between dynamics result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/P activity. A minimalistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics can contribute to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and inform therapeutic strategies.
Researchers developed the COPS package for evaluating single and multi-omics clustering methods, focusing on robustness and prognostic relevance. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data and knowledge-driven clustering methods, incorporating cross-validation for robustness. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models with covariates, and stability of results. Survival and agreement metrics varied across methods and datasets, emphasizing the need for multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case study. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different survival outcomes. The study demonstrated COPS effectiveness in benchmarking multi-clustering to categorize patients based on multi-profiles, providing insights into multiomics analysis for cancer subtyping and implications for patient stratification and treatment.
In C. elegans, the SoxC protein SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and specifying the sexmyoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. A novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified. Detailed analysis of mutant animals harboring this mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM- functions antagonistically with LET-381, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. SEM- is also essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM directly regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic-helix-helix transcription factor and plays critical roles in patterning the lineage. Data suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The study adds to the understanding of the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembry development and the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. SEM-2 regulates hl-8 expression possibly directly in SM and is essential for proliferation and diversification of SM. The study uncovered interactions in the gene network underlying C. elegans postry development, some of which are conserved in other species, and adds to the understanding the functions and structure of SoxC proteins.
