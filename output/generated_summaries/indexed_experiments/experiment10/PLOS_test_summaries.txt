Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the spread of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT), a parasitic disease that can cause severe illness and death if left untreated, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The model was fitted to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province, a region with a high burden of the disease. The stochastic model, which accounts for uncertainty, was able to capture the dynamics of AT observed at the health level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic AT model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for better quantification of results. The analysis used a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology to fit the model to the data. Spatial heterogeneity in cases was reflected in the results, predicting that under current strategies, the area Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will be the last to achieve elimination. The deterministic version of the model, fitted with MCM, had faster computation times but virtually indistinguishable parameterisation. The authors suggest expanding area fitting to more of RC should be done with deterministic for efficiency, with stochastic used to capture parameter and variation in reporting and elimination estimations. The study demonstrates a mechanistic stochastic model can be fitted to health data in RC, providing a framework for detailed projections of future infections under intervention scenarios.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) using spatial functions and random forest models to predict patient outcomes and identify important spatial relationships. The method controls false discovery rate and is resistant to overfitting. It was evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying spatial patterns with known interactions. The approach was applied to triple-negative breast cancer and lung cancer data from multiplex ion imaging. For TNBC, two groups were separated into "compartmentalized" and "mixed" based on tumor-immune cell interactions. The method produced functions for cell-cell interactions, reduced dimensions using principal components, and combined with patient data to predict outcomes. A random forest model was used to identify important interactions.

The method was applied to lung cancer data, comparing squamous and adenocarcinomas, and identified differences in cell relationships. It was also applied to TNBC, identifying clusters and important interactions. The approach overcomes challenges in distinguishing meaningful interactions among many potential interactions, controlling the false rate. It generates easy-to-interpret plots and has high power even with small samples. A random forest model was used to evaluate the importance of spatial interactions and meta-data in predicting outcomes. The method is the first to evaluate spatial interactions in TME that vary with many potential interactions. Many methods rely on simple summaries or simplify data, such as clustering or a single distance.

The approach uses a combination of spatial statistics, functional analysis, and machine learning to identify useful relationships in TME predicting outcomes. It can be applied to data from various technologies, such as OP, Phenycler, Fusion, Mcope, Xenium, and Cosmx. The power to detect a single interaction decreases with increasing cells. The method was applied to TNBC, identifying clusters and interactions, and lung cancer, detecting differences in relationships.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), i. e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP, i. e., without weight-dependent pruning, and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e. g., in Parkinson’s disease.

   . In the present study, we captured the interactions of neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and structural changes while maintaining distinct timescales of the three by employing STDP that connected neuronal spiking and synaptic weight change, hSP that connected average neuronal activity ( firing rate ) and structural change, and weight-dependent pruning that captured the interaction of synaptic weight and structural dynamics

. We aim to study the effect of the two distinct plasticity mechanisms ( synaptic weight and structural ) on the dynamical states of the network and to understand the co-evolution of network activity and structure ( synaptic reorganization ). As shown computationally, stimulus responses of neural networks with STDP may significantly differ from stimulus responses in networks with fixed coupling strength, i. e., fixed synaptic weights [21, 23, 24, 33, 62, 63]

. To account for additional plasticity mechanisms, in this study, we also focus on the effect of SP on the response of neuronal networks to stimulation by comparing the desynchronization of random networks with frozen structures with those that undergo synaptic reorganization to reach a steady synchronized state

. Thus, it is essential to capture the complex interactions between neuronal dynamics and synaptic plasticity during transitions to and in steady ( de ) synchronized states in plastic neuronal networks

. The network model maintains the distinction between the timescales of neuronal activity and plasticity mechanisms. The stochastic SP method is computationally fast and we compare it with a prevailing method introduced in Ref. [61], referred to as Butz and van Ooyen SP ( BvOSP ) in this study, which is neuroscientifically informed but computationally costlier [20]. We show that our stochastic SP method produces network dynamics similar to those by BvOSP

. Establishing a simpler model of SP that captures the essential mechanisms that govern changes in brain networks may allow for a reliable and more detailed numerical analysis. We propose a simple model, stochastic SP ( described below ), which directly builds or eliminates synaptic contacts between neurons without separately modeling the neurite outgrowth/retraction or generation/deletion of synaptic elements

. Incorporating all three in a computational study thus poses the challenge of maintaining such distinct timescales while keeping the network model computationally less costly so that a detailed analysis of the network dynamics may be conducted. Here, we combine the LIF neuron model with a standard additive STDP rule and introduce a stochastic SP rule that adds and eliminates synaptic contacts based on the firing rate of a postsynaptic neuron and the weight of the contacts

. Therefore, we separate the structural updates from the spiking dynamics and the synaptic weight change by considering structural updates as discrete events, similar to a previously used strategy [53]. Specifically, we assume that between consecutive structural updates ( SP iterations ) no structural change occurs for a time interval ΔTsp and the network evolves either with STDP-only or no plasticity

. To understand how each type of plasticity governs the network dynamics, we first studied the synchronized states of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks consisting of identical and non-identical neurons, respectively, with STDP-only. In this context, a perfectly synchronized state is defined by the coincident firing of the entire network

. Plastic networks of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) model neurons have been used to design and validate effective stimulation methods such as coordinated and random reset ( CR and RR ) stimulation [21–24], which leverage the synaptic weight plasticity to induce therapeutic effects. The weight of a synaptic contact can change depending on the exact timing of the spikes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons [25, 26]. This mechanism is termed STDP [26–28]

Neurons form networks that are plastic in nature. The spiking dynamics of neurons, the weight ( transmission efficiency ) of the synaptic contacts, and the structure of the networks can change with time [1–4]. The plastic nature of neuronal networks enables learning and memory [5, 6], stabilization of networks in spontaneous and experience-induced conditions [7, 8], and recovery and rehabilitation after stroke and injuries [9–11]

. As the network progressed through SP iterations, the neurons became increasingly more identical by adding or losing contacts as their firing rates converged to a single target rate with both SP methods ( stochastic and BvOSP ) regardless of weight-dependent pruning, making way for enhanced network synchronization for any value of the probability of weight-dependent pruning, i. e., Pw ∈ [0, 1]

Different implementations of adaptive neuronal networks with synaptic plasticity, both weight and structural plasticity, have been used to study either the properties of emergent network structures in the equilibrium [46, 47, 106] or the resulting synchronization dynamics [20, 50–53]. Synchronization is an emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction of the nodes and the structure of a network

. On the other hand, it makes nearby neurons more likely to connect, producing distance-dependent connectivity [48]. Structural changes in a network occur at a much longer timescale than synaptic weight change ( due to STDP ) and neuronal spiking dynamics [4, 6]

. As the initially random network in the synchronized state underwent structural updates in the presence of weight-dependent pruning, the potentiated contacts survived for longer times, while the depressed ones eventually got pruned. As a consequence, the structure of the network in the presence of SP underwent a reorganization governed by the natural firing rates of the neurons

. The network with STDP+hSP settles with β = 0. 106 and the order parameter and average firing rate similar to those of the network with STDP+SP. To highlight the role of network structure that emerges in the presence of SP or hSP on the robustness of networks against stimulation, we halt the structural updates during and after stimulation. Fig 21 compares the intensity and frequency of stimulus needed to induce desynchronization in the networks considered

. The timescales of neuronal spiking and changes in synaptic weights and network structure are rather distinct. Whereas the spiking activity may occur at a sub-second timescale, the synaptic weight and structural changes may take minutes to hours [58] and hours to days [59, 60], respectively

. Since the neurons are arranged on L × L square lattice, the network structure becomes distance-independent for l 0 ≫ 2 L. The firing rate dependence function, G (. ), is a logistic function defined as G ( Ω, Ω 0, ν ) = 1 1 + exp ( - Ω - Ω 0 ν ), ( 11 ) where the parameters Ω0 and ν determine the midpoint and the slope, respectively. In our model, a synaptic contact can be pruned independently by either the homeostatic or weight-dependent processes

. SP is another noted form of plasticity that reorganizes the network structure via addition and elimination ( pruning ) of synaptic contacts depending on the activity of the neurons, referred to as synaptic reorganization, besides sprouting and reshaping of synaptic elements [4, 6]. The addition and pruning of synaptic contacts may depend on several factors, such as the synaptic weight, firing rates of the neurons, and the physical distance between neurons [4, 38, 39]

. Next, we developed networks from unconnected neurons using STDP+SP ( Pw > 0 ) and STDP+hSP ( Pw = 0 ) and compared their transition to synchronized states as a function of network density with networks generated using hSP-only and the random networks with STDP-only. The network developed from scratch using hSP ( P = 0 ) and STDP ( P > 0 ) reached a synchronized state faster than the network with STDP ( P = 0 ) and hSP ( P > 0. The network with STDP+h ( P = 0 ) and hSP ( P > 0 reached a synchronized state faster than the network with STDP ( P > 0 ) and h ( P = 0. The network with STDP ( P = 0 ) and h ( P > 0 reached a synchronized state faster than the network with ST ( P > ) and h ( P = 0. The network with ST ( P ) and h ( P reached a synchronized state faster than the network ST ( P and h. The network with ST ( P and h reached a synchronized state faster than the network ( P and h. The network ( P and h reached a synchronized faster than the network ( P. The network ( P reached a faster than the network. The network reached faster than the network.
Researchers investigated the regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of flatworm that can regenerate large parts of its nervous system. They found that neurons express a gene delta-2, which interacts with Notch-expressing phagoc progenitors to form glia. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 reduced glia, but not other phocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation, while transplantation of delta-2-express neurons formed gl at ectopic locations. This suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia. The study also explored Notch signaling's role in planarian gl regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal development. Notch is essential for cell fate specification and patterning in metazoans. Neurons regenerate in proper numbers and positions with delta-2 expression, interacting with Notch+ phoc progenitors to form gl. This pathway regulates gl specification and differentiation between mature neurons and unrelated phoc progenitors. Differentiated glia were observed with delta-2-express neurons, supporting interaction between delta- and Notch phoc progenitors for gl differentiation. Inhibition of notch-1, delta-2, and su genes did not affect other phytic cells, but gl were absent in head, eyes, and dorsal regions. The study addresses coordinated regeneration of neurons and gl, a challenge in planarians. Placement of delta-2 neurons in ectopic locations yields access to phoc progen, enabling gl formation. The findings suggest a novel approach integrating gl with neurons in regenerating nervous systems, solving gl specification in numbers and locations using delta-Notch signaling.

    Title: 
    Abstract: New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development. We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. In addition, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. Thus, γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies.

   . On the contrary, Vδ1 T cells expansion occurred only during chronic HIV infection ( CHI ), and was not associated with viral load. Expression levels of CD16 on Vδ1+ T cells as well as CD57 on Vδ2+ T cells during AHI were higher in participants that developed breadth and were significantly associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. Furthermore, levels of CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells were associated with early founder Env specific IgM production

. Here, we investigated γδ T cells prior to HIV-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in RV217 individuals previously identified as ‘broad’ and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers, and determined their relationship with viral replication as well as bNAb elicitation. We found that Vδ2+ T cells were significantly reduced during early AHI and their loss was associated with viral load

. Understanding the mechanism by which γδ T cells promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve vaccine induced humoral immune responses, especially the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibody to HIV-1 Env

. In this study, we evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells longitudinally starting from pre-HIV acquisition and during untreated AHI in participants with or without neutralization breadth [16], allowing us to evaluate the contribution of γδ T cells to initial control of viral replication and to the promotion of humoral immune responses

. The frequency of Vδ2+ T cells was lower at day 18 post first HIV-1 positive test in the participants that developed neutralization breadth, probably reflecting the higher peak VL in those participants. CD16 levels on both Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells as well as CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells were found to be higher on participants that developed neutralization breadth

. Finally, we tested for associations between the phenotype of γδ T cells and peak breadth, potency, as well as autologous gp140-specific IgM at month 1 post HIV-acquisition, that we previously reported to be associated with development of neutralization breadth in the RV217 participants analyzed in this study [16]

First, to determine the dynamics of γδ T cell responses during AHI and CHI, Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells from 22 selected RV217 participants, who were previously identified as ‘broad’ ( N = 11 ) and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers ( N = 11 ) [16] ( Table 1 ) were sorted ( Fig 1A and S1 ) from PBMC samples collected at median −185 ( pre-acquisition ), 18 ( corresponding to peak VL ), 42 ( corresponding to set point VL ), and 980 days ( CHI ) following the first detection of HIV RNA in the blood

. Strikingly, we found that expression levels of CD16 and CD57 by Vδ1+ T cells pre- and post-HIV acquisition were associated with the plasma levels of founder gp140 specific IgM at month 1 post first HIV+ test ( Fig 5D ). Furthermore, levels of CD16 by Vδ2+ T cells pre-acquisition and at day 42 post first HIV+ test, corresponding to set point VL, correlated with breadth and potency

. We found that participants who had high levels of CD16 expression ( above 33% quantile ) by Vδ1+ T cells at setpoint VL ( median 42 days post first HIV+ test ) were significantly more likely to develop neutralization breadth. High expression of CD69 ( above 66% quantile ) at setpoint VL ( median 42 days HIV+ ) or of α4β7 ( above 66% quantile ) at peak VL ( median 18 days HIV+ ) by Vδ1+ T cells were associated with lower odds of developing neutralization breadth

. Our results suggest that γδ T cells might be important for early promotion of B cell engagement following HIV-1 acquisition and subsequent development of neutralization breadth.

. However, the prospective cohort allowed us to show that expression of these two markers was not modulated by HIV-1 and that significant differences were already present pre-HIV acquisition for CD16 and CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells. Infections with HCMV and malaria have been reported to increase expression of these markers by γδ T cells [48, 62]

. While the levels of some of these markers changed over time following HIV acquisition, the only significant difference between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not was the co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR at the chronic time point for conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Fig H in S1 File ). Thus, this indicates that the observed differences in the levels of CD16, CD57, CD69, and α4β7 are unique to γδ T cells

. This includes following interaction with opsonized target cells by CD16, the low affinity FcγRIII, at the surface of γδ T cells [26, 27]. γδ T cells can also promote humoral immune responses directly by stimulating the maturation of B cells [28] or indirectly by stimulating the differentiation of T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells [29, 30]. Thus, γδ T cells bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. HIV-1 has a profound impact on γδ T cells

. CD16 expression by Vδ1+ T cells was associated with B cell engagement during AHI, suggesting that these cells might promote the initial founder-specific naïve B cell response to HIV-1. One possibility is that γδ T cells could differentiate into antigen presenting cells following engagement of CD16 with opsonized target cells [26]

. Participants with Vδ1+ T cells expressing CD16 above the median levels or with Vδ2+ T cells expressing CD57 above the first tertile at setpoint VL ( 42 days HIV+ ) were significantly more likely to develop neutralization breadth ( Fig J in S1 File ). No other marker could separate participants that developed neutralization breadth using cumulative incidence curves

. To gain further insight to the γδ T cell response following HIV-1 acquisition, sorted total γδ T cells were processed for bulk RNA sequencing and gene expression post HIV-acquisition was compared to pre-acquisition ( Fig 3A and S2 File ). The highest number of genes with increased expression was found at peak VL ( median 18 days from first detectable HIV+ test; Fig 3B )

. 841, and 0. 798 respectively ( Fig 5B ). Similarly, at setpoint VL ( median 42 days HIV+ ), CD16+ Vδ1+ T cells, CD16+ Vδ2+ T cells, CD57+ Vδ2+ T cells, and α4β7+ Vδ1+ T cells had an AUC of 0. 84, 0. 793, 0. 795, and 0. 83 respectively ( Fig 5C ). Overall, this suggests that expression of these markers by Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells during AHI discriminate between participants that will develop neutralization breadth. In addition, we performed cumulative incidence curves

. Participants with Vδ2+ T cells expressing high levels of CD57 ( 33% quantile ) or CD16 ( 33% quantile ) at setpoint VL ( median 42 days HIV+ ) or double negative for CD45RO and CCR7 ( 66% quantile ) at peak VL ( median 18 days HIV+ ) were also significantly more likely to develop neutralization breadth ( Fig 5A )

. This is in accordance with our flow cytometry results showing that co-expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR during AHI was associated with viral load. Due to sample limitations, γδ T cell functions were not evaluated. Additional studies are needed to investigate if γδ T cell functions have an impact on HIV-1 progression. Overall, we found no clear evidence that peripheral γδ T cells could limit viral replication during AHI

. This suggests that some of the variability in the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells pre-HIV acquisition might come from exposure to malaria. Next, to investigate what factors associate with Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cell activation, we measured the plasma levels of several inflammatory markers

  Researchers investigated the role of gamma delta (γ) T cells in the development of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in individuals with varying levels of neutralization breadth. They found significant differences in γ T cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutral breadth and those who did not. Activation of γ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on V1 cells and CD57 on V2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers during acute infection and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD on V1 cells were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. γ T cells may promote neutralization development, which has implications for vaccine strategies. The study longitudinally evaluated frequency and phenotype of γ cells from pre-HIV and during acute infection in participants with and without neutral breadth, allowing evaluation of contribution to viral control and humoral responses. Frequency of V2 cells was lower at 18 days post HIV positive in broad neutralizers, reflecting higher viral load. CD levels on V1 and V2 cells as well as CD on V2 were higher in broad neutralizers. The study found associations between γ cell phenotype and breadth, peak potency, and autologous gp-specific Ig at 1 post-HIV, previously associated with neutral in participants. The dynamics of γ cell responses during acute and chronic infection were evaluated from selected participants, previously identified as broad and non-broad neutral. Strikingly, expression of CD and CD by V cells pre and post-HIV was associated with plasma gp140 Ig at 1 post HIV. Levels of CD by V cells pre and at 42 post HIV correlated with breadth and potency. Participants with high CD expression above 33%ile by V cells at set point were more likely to develop neutral. High of CD above 66ile at point and α7 above 66 at peak by V cells associated lower odds of neutral.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

    In this study, we have developed a model of a bispecific antibody ( BS1 ) targeting two key cell surface receptors, IL-6Rα and IL-8RB, which were recently implicated in a synergistic pathway that drives tumor metastasis [12, 28]. Our model is comprised of a series of ODEs for each of the receptors, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes studied

. To study and potentially better target the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network for metastasis inhibition, Yang and colleagues recently engineered a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, against IL-6R and IL-8RB ( also known as CXCR2, hereafter called IL-8R ) [28]. BS1 contains arms with variable domains of two distinct antibodies: the anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab and the anti-IL-8R antibody 10H2 [5, 29] ( Fig 1A )

. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality. Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) have been a fixture in anti-cancer therapeutic regimens over the past 20 years [16, 17] due to their target specificity, in vivo stability, modular construction, and multi-faceted actions

. To better understand the impact of the antibody concentration on bispecific antibody-receptor complex formation, and in particular on the relative formation of binary ( BS1-IL-6R or BS1-IL-8R ) versus ternary ( IL-6R-BS1-IL-8R ) complexes, we performed simulations of BS1 binding over a range of initial antibody concentrations and for cells with differing levels of combined IL-6R and IL-8R expression ( Fig 5 )

. While the total level of receptor expression is a key determinant of bivalent antibody binding, the relative amount of the two different target receptors is also critical for bispecific antibodies. Our simulations revealed that when IL-6R and IL-8R are present in a 1:1 ratio, bispecific antibody binding is nearly identical to the binding of the combination of anti-IL-6R and anti-IL-8R monospecific antibodies ( Fig 7A )

. We demonstrate that the ratio between expression levels of IL-6R and IL-8R is crucial to bispecific antibody binding in vitro and leads to significant differences in monospecific and bispecific antibody behavior. Simulations also predict necessary antibody concentrations for optimal binding, namely that the most stable antibody-receptor complex formation occurs at high receptor concentrations and intermediate antibody concentrations

. To therapeutically inhibit IL-6/IL-8-mediated metastasis, we are examining two existing monospecific antibodies, tocilizumab ( denoted anti-IL-6R ) [42] and 10H2 ( denoted anti-IL-8R ) [5, 29], and the novel bispecific antibody, BS1 ( denoted anti-IL-6R/anti-IL-8R ), first described by Yang et al. [28] ( Fig 1A )

. This modeling could in turn identify optimal bispecific design parameters to balance avidity with the rate of antibody endocytosis and elimination from the system. Additionally, as the aim of BS1 treatment is to inhibit IL-6/IL-8-driven metastasis, adding IL-6 and IL-8 secretion and binding to this system will allow us to directly model how antibody binding leads to ligand inhibition

. Here we presented a mechanistic, computational model for antibodies targeting IL-6R and IL-8R, comprised of a series of ordinary differential equations describing antibody binding dynamics. We fully parameterized the model from existing data, and our simulations closely match experimental data of monospecific and bispecific antibodies binding to cells expressing different levels of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors

. Sengers et al. [40] simulated the kinetics of receptor-antibody-receptor complex formation as diffusion-limited to model BsAb binding at low receptor densities. Here, we extend existing general modeling frameworks to build a quantitative, computational model for a specific therapeutic target: antibodies targeting the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors for the prevention of cancer metastasis

The three key antibodies of interest we are using to target the receptors in the IL-6/IL-8 system are tocilizumab ( anti-IL-6Rα ), 10H2 ( anti-IL-8RB ), and a novel bispecific antibody developed by Yang et al. [28], BS1 ( anti-IL-6Rα/anti-IL-8RB ) ( Fig 1A )

. Our simulation results showed that receptor expression is critical for bispecific antibody binding, both in terms of total receptor levels and in the relative amounts of the individual targets. As IL-6 and IL-8 are both pleiotropic immune factors, their receptors are also expressed on healthy white blood cells and other tissues

. This increases BS1 binding to IL-6R, even when it is present at substantially lower concentrations than the other receptor. This behavior is observed only for the bispecific antibody and is driven by the initial interaction with the excess receptor

. To analyze the impact of individual model parameters on the bispecific antibody binding, we performed local and global univariate sensitivity analyses of the model output ( Fig 8 ). First, we examined the local sensitivity of ternary IL-6R-BS1-IL-8R complex formation and total receptor binding to changes in the values of the association and dissociation rate constants along with initial antibody and receptor concentrations ( Fig 8A )

. While our model provides significant insight into the mechanisms of bivalent and bispecific antibody binding, expanding the model to include additional processes and other cell types has the potential to give even more insight into these treatments

. However, monospecific mAbs have limitations, including the emergence of acquired resistance as cancer cells mutate [18]. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), antibodies engineered to simultaneously engage two different target molecules, demonstrate great potential to overcome the shortcomings of antibody drugs [19–21]. Binding in cis, i. e

. To further examine how antibody-receptor complex formation compares between monospecific and bispecific antibodies, we simulated BS1 and the combination of tocilizumab and 10H2 over a range of different IL-6R and IL-8R expression levels ( Fig 7A ). In these simulations, the total initial antibody concentration was held constant at 10 nM, and tocilizumab and 10H2 were combined in a 1:1 ratio

. Overall, our model simulations with different antibody constructs clarify the effects of binding domain affinity and target expression on receptor inhibition, providing insight that is applicable not only to our particular BsAb system, but also more broadly to bispecific antibody therapeutic design.

. Our detailed simulations of the in vitro monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the target receptors, IL-6R and IL-8R, establish how binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complex formation drives target inhibition

. The proportion of each individual receptor that is bound is reported. IL-8R was simulated as the excess receptor because it has been shown to be up-regulated relative to IL-6R in breast cancer [28], and similar results are shown when for simulations with IL-6R in excess ( S13 Fig ). The monospecific antibodies ( tocilizumab and 10H2 ) each bind to a single receptor type, so the binding of each receptor is independent

    Researchers have developed a computational model of a bispecific antibody, BS1, which targets the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, implicated in a synergistic pathway that drives metastasis. The model is comprised of a series of ordinary differential equations for each receptor, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes. To better target the IL-6/8 signaling for metastasis inhibition, a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, was engineered against IL-6 and IL8. BS contains variable domains of two antibodies: anti-IL6 tocilizum and anti-IL8 10. Simulations of BS binding over a range of antibody concentrations and cells with differing IL-6 and IL-8 expression show that the level of receptor expression is a determinant of bivalent binding. The ratio of IL-6 and IL-8 is critical for bispecific binding, with nearly identical binding to the combination of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 monospecific at a 1:1 ratio. Simulations predict antibody concentrations for optimal binding, with most stable antibody-receptor formation at high receptor and intermediate antibody concentrations. Monospecific antibodies tocilizab and 10 bind a single receptor, with binding independent of each other. The bispecific BS1 binds IL-6, even at lower concentrations than IL-8, due to initial interaction with excess receptor. Local and global sensitivity analyses of the model show ternary IL-6-BS-IL-8 complex and receptor binding to changes in association and dissociation rate constants and antibody concentrations. The model provides insight into mechanisms of bivalent and bis binding, expanding to include additional processes and cell types has potential for more insight.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types, oocytes of most species lack these structures. During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles, but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure. Simultaneously, microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood. Here, we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division, but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood. We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects. Importantly, experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Further, we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. Altogether, our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis.

   . Thus, we propose that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in C. elegans oocytes: 1 ) ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics, to facilitate the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and 2 ) ZYG-8 influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules, to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. These two functions could be interconnected

. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain [22]. Previous studies using a series of temperature-sensitive zyg-8 mutants demonstrated that ZYG-8 is required for proper spindle positioning in C. elegans mitotically dividing embryos [22, 23]. Moreover, analysis of astral microtubule dynamics demonstrated that ZYG-8 depletion led to reduced growth rates and increased nucleation rates, demonstrating that ZYG-8 modulates microtubule dynamics in mitosis [24]

. Here, we show that ZYG-8 is required for both the assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle. Further, we demonstrate that ZYG-8’s kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis, and we reveal important roles for this protein in modulating both microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle

. Further experiments will be crucial to understand the various ways that ZYG-8 contributes to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and spindle forces. In summary, our studies have provided new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division. Moreover, our work has shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles, and on how the bipolar spindle structure is stabilized

. Therefore, the phenotypes observed following ZYG-8 depletion cannot be explained solely by overactivation of BMK-1, demonstrating that ZYG-8 contributes to proper spindle organization in additional ways. Previous studies have demonstrated that ZYG-8 regulates microtubule assembly in C. elegans mitotically-dividing embryos; ZYG-8 depletion via RNAi led to reduced microtubule growth rates and increased nucleation rates [22, 24]

. In a similar vein, since our data suggest that ZYG-8 regulates both microtubule dynamics and motor-driven spindle forces, it is also possible that this represents a separation of function mutation, and that kinase activity is required for one of these functions but not the other. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ZYG-8 plays multiple important roles during meiosis and provide important new insights into how the spindle is formed and stabilized in oocytes.

Altogether, our data reveal an important role for ZYG-8 in facilitating the assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle ( Fig 9 ). During spindle assembly, microtubule minus ends must be pushed outwards away from the chromosomes, necessitating the production of outward forces [10]. However, mechanisms must also exist to limit these forces and microtubule dynamics must be precisely regulated in order for the spindle to maintain a stable length ( Fig 9A )

. Thus, ZYG-8 likely has both kinase-dependent and independent functions. Doublecortin-family proteins have been shown to bind microtubules directly to regulate aspects of microtubule dynamics, including decreasing the catastrophe frequency and increasing the nucleation rate [32, 33, 56–60]. Since ZYG-8 localizes broadly throughout the spindle, it is possible that it directly modulates microtubule dynamics via its microtubule-binding doublecortin domain

. In oocytes, ZYG-8 is required for anaphase B spindle elongation [25] and a recent study demonstrated that it excludes the microtubule crosslinker SPD-1PRC1 from the anaphase spindle, thus regulating spindle structure during chromosome segregation [26]. While this study also noted that there were metaphase spindle defects following ZYG-8 depletion, the question of how ZYG-8 facilitates proper spindle organization was not explored

. elegans [17]. Moreover, members of the XMAP215 family of microtubule polymerases can also be phosphorylated [54] and the C. elegans XMAP215 homolog ZYG-9, like ZYG-8, is required for spindle stability in oocytes [9]. Or finally, another possibility is that ZYG-8’s kinase activity is required for its own localization or function

In most cell types, centrosomes function to nucleate and organize a microtubule-based spindle [1]. However, oocytes of most species lack centrosomes and yet are able to form a bipolar spindle [2, 3]. In human oocytes, these acentrosomal spindles have been shown to be highly unstable; after bipolarity is achieved, the poles often split apart, and this instability leads to a high incidence of chromosome segregation errors [4]

. Therefore, precise tuning of microtubule number, length, and dynamics is essential for the spindle to properly form and maintain its structure. Although it is known that force balance and microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled in the acentrosomal spindle, the mechanisms by which this control is achieved are not well understood. Here, we provide insight into these mechanisms through analysis of ZYG-8, a conserved microtubule-associated protein

. These methods have made it possible to either deplete proteins prior to spindle formation, to probe for roles in spindle assembly, or to remove proteins from pre-formed spindles and then assess effects on the stability of the structure [7–9]. In C. elegans oocytes, assembly of the spindle begins with nuclear envelope breakdown. Microtubules initially nucleate and form a cage-like structure around the meiotic chromosomes

. The decreased turnover of GFP::tubulin suggests that microtubules are more stable following ZYG-8 depletion. This change in dynamics could contribute to the observed spindle defects since a global stabilization of microtubules would be predicted to cause spindle elongation. Thus, ZYG-8 is required for proper microtubule dynamics in the acentrosomal oocyte spindle, revealing another function of ZYG-8 that likely contributes to spindle assembly and stability

. Interestingly, this study also demonstrated that dynein provides an inward force on the spindle; acute dynein depletion caused the spindle to elongate and the poles to splay. Thus, a balance of motor-generated outward and inward forces is essential to form and maintain the acentrosomal spindle in C. elegans oocytes. In addition to motors, other factors are also necessary for spindle stability

. An important question is how ZYG-8 performs its various roles within the spindle. Notably, our studies demonstrate that kinase activity is required for ZYG-8 function. This is an important finding, since the mammalian homolog of ZYG-8 ( DCLK1/doublecortin-like kinase 1 ) is upregulated in a wide range of cancers, and knockdown studies have suggested that it is required for tumor progression

To begin investigating the function of C. elegans ZYG-8 in acentrosomal spindle assembly, we utilized two different zyg-8 temperature sensitive mutant strains, one with a mutation within the microtubule-binding Doublecortin domain, zyg-8 ( or484 ), and the other with a mutation within the kinase domain, zyg-8 ( b235 ) ( Figs 1A and S1A ). These mutants have been previously characterized and both display mitotic defects at the restrictive temperature of 25°C [22, 23]

. This could be a reason why spindles formed in the absence of ZYG-8 are longer than in wild type oocytes, and why acute removal of ZYG-8 from pre-formed spindles results in spindle elongation ( Figs 2A and 2B)

    Title: 
    Abstract: Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL ) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications.

    In this study, we have investigated the links between plasma metabolite profiles, genetics, and the risk of T2D and subsequent complications, to evaluate the metabolic consequences of T2D. We have identified more metabolites as causally affected by T2D liability rather than having a causal effect on disease risk. Further, we have shown that T2D occurrence seems to have an impact on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels

. We investigated whether there was a different effect of the genetic variants on metabolite profiles, which could explain the causal effects of T2D liability on metabolite profiles, through an interaction mQTL analysis. We identified 222 variants having a significant interaction between the mQTL effect and T2D status, corresponding to 14 metabolites, including glycine and various lipids

. All of the interaction variants replicated in the EstBB are mQTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the overall UKBB cohort but are not associated with T2D risk in the latest T2D GWAS meta-analysis [3]. These findings suggest that the different genetic regulation of metabolite levels observed between T2D patients and controls is a consequence rather than a cause of the disease, in line with the results of the reverse MR for S_HDL_FC_pct and L_VLDL_TG_pct

. In addition to investigating relationships between metabolite levels and T2D, we described for the first time, to our knowledge, differences in their genetic regulation between T2D patients and controls for 14 metabolites, of which four were replicated in an independent cohort. All of the significant variants identified were found to be significant mQTLs in the overall UKBB but were not associated with T2D risk [3]

. Improved prediction of various complex traits using metabolite profiles over genetic scores has been shown[9], but this improvement is rather limited when compared to classical risk factors including age, sex and family history of disease [10, 11]. The limited prediction of metabolite profiles may be related to the uncertain causal role in modulating T2D risk, a question investigated using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) [12]

. By using interaction models, we went one step further to describe the consequences of T2D occurrence on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation. We highlight that changes in metabolite profiles can be useful to better understand T2D disease progression, as exemplified by the metabolites associated with the risk of developing T2D complications

. To this end, multi-omics data such as metabolite levels offer great promise, as they enable the study of molecular phenotypes closely implicated in the disease. A large number of metabolites have been associated with T2D, as highlighted in a recent study from Julkunen et al. [4], which described 230 metabolites as nominally associated with incident and prevalent T2D

. Consistent associations between T2D risk and metabolites across studies mostly cover increases in various amino acid levels, especially branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) [5–7], and dyslipidemia [4, 8]. However, the predictive value of metabolite profiles in T2D risk is still debated

. Here, we aim to address these questions and elucidate the metabolic consequences of T2D by investigating the links between metabolite profiles, genetics, and the risk of T2D and subsequent complications

. Previous MR studies performed in the UKBB cohort have used only the first release of data for the 249 metabolites and were either limited to a few metabolites, or only investigated a single causal direction [16, 18, 26]. Secondly, we performed an interaction mQTL analysis to assess whether there is a different genetic regulation of metabolite levels between T2D patients and controls

Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a common, complex disease, with a prevalence that is expected to increase dramatically, and for which the genetics has been largely described through genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis efforts [1–3]. The next step towards translating these associations into the clinic is to understand the biological mechanisms behind them

. Finally, we investigated how metabolite profiles are associated with T2D complications, and whether these associated metabolites overlap with the metabolites causally affected by T2D liability.

. Conflicting conclusions exist for other metabolites, and little is known about the role of genetic regulation in shaping these relationships. The genetic regulation of metabolite profiles is increasingly described, for example through the latest meta-analysis reporting over 400 independent loci associated with 233 metabolite levels [19]

. We identified 165 associations between metabolite levels and the risk of developing T2D complications, most of which were shared across complication groups with only few, such as creatinine and glycine, being more strongly associated with microvascular than macrovascular outcomes despite smaller sample size of the microvascular group. A total of 118 metabolites were also found to be significant in the MR analyses, with similar profiles of association

. Finally, our study provides useful insights into the metabolic consequences of T2D but is limited by the assayed metabolite panel, which is mostly composed of lipid-related plasma metabolites. Additional metabolite classes, as well as metabolite levels from different tissue types would help in better unravelling biological mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolites were considered individually as exposure, which does not capture overall metabolic pathways

. These metabolite QTLs, also called mQTLs, are usually reported in the general population, and studies are starting to emerge on how they are modified by factors such as diet [20]. However, no study to date has investigated the question of whether the genetic regulation of metabolite levels is affected by the occurrence of T2D. A large part of the healthcare burden associated with T2D is due to subsequent complications of the disease

. TG levels, which we found to be causally affected by T2D liability and for some of the related percentages significant in our interaction QTL analysis, may therefore contribute to increased glucose levels. For all other types of lipoproteins that were significant in the reverse MR analyses, T2D liability had a causal effect on decreasing their levels. This includes absolute LDL levels and to a lesser extent their related percentages, in line with previous studies [4, 18, 41, 42, 53]

. By performing an agnostic genome-wide scan to look for interaction signals, we have observed that all the interaction variants, which are mQTLs at a population-level, led to a decreased magnitude of metabolite genetic regulation in the T2D patients’ group compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed that these interactions resulted in attenuated differences in metabolite levels between cases and controls

. A genetic dysregulation of glycine levels might, therefore, be involved in T2D complications etiology, but replication is needed in an independent cohort. Our findings also provide insights into the role of lipoprotein classes in T2D etiology. For example, TG levels have been described to be positively associated with T2D[40] and are known to positively correlate with glucose levels, a relationship that may be exacerbated in individuals with high polygenic risk scores for T2D[52]

. However, replication of these associations is still needed, as well as investigating whether the metabolites associated with T2D complications are distinct from the ones causally affected by T2D liability. Exploring the links between metabolite levels and T2D can help us gain insights into how these relationships may influence trajectories towards T2 complications

The study of metabolite profiles in T2 has been shown to improve prediction of disease risk [9, 10, 11] but is limited compared to classical factors such as age, sex, and family history of disease [10, 11]. This may be due to the uncertain role of metabolites in modulating T2 risk, investigated using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) [12. We used interaction models to describe the consequences of T2 occurrence on metabolite levels and their regulation, highlighting that changes in metabol profiles can be useful in understanding T2 disease progression, as exemplified by metabolites associated with the risk of developing T2 complications

In conclusion, this study provides a map of the consequences of T2 on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2 trajectory to complications. Our findings suggest that T2 occurrence has an impact on the regulation of metabolite levels, which is not a cause but a consequence of the disease, in line with the results of reverse MR for HDL_FC and LLDG. We identified 165 metabolites associated with T2 complications, of which are not causally linked to T2 in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides insights into the metabolic of T2 and its impact on genetic regulation of metabolite levels.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA, USA300 ), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55% and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. In this QTL, the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival.

   . These differences in immune parameters suggest that the two strains differ in their immune response after infection. To understand the genetic components involved in tolerance after infection, we created an F1 population by crossing MRSA susceptible CC061 mice with MRSA tolerant CC024 mice. We infected 14 animals from the F1 generation and compared their phenotypes with those of their parents

. aureus than mice expressing these genes [45, 46]. We investigated the genetic factors behind the tolerance to infections with MRSA USA300. We chose a susceptible strain ( C0061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ) from our previous 7 day MRSA infection screen to identify genomic regions that are involved in these phenotypes [31]. The tolerant strain, CC024, survived longer and lost less weight than CC0061, despite similar colonization, including high colonization in the kidney

. C3 deficient mice are more susceptible to S. aureus infections [67, 68]. While we do not understand the mechanism underlying the baseline up-regulation of complement genes, C3 and C4b in CC024, increased expression of these immune factors may improve CC024 survival by reducing the initial pathogen load. To identify the genes needed for CC024 mice to tolerate MRSA infection despite high colonization in some organs, we generated an F2 cross between CC024 and CC061

. The median survival for the F1 generation was seven days, similar to CC024 mice and significantly higher than CC061 mice ( Fig 3A ). F1 mice maintained their weight more similar to the CC024 parent, most losing less weight than the CC061 parent ( Fig 3B ). These data support a complex dominant inheritance pattern for survival in the F1 cross between CC061 and CC024 mice. Survival after MRSA infection has a genetic component and is likely linked to dominant alleles in CC024

. F1 mice were bred together to generate a large panel of F2 mice to further investigate the genetic components of tolerance and susceptibility. We infected 316 F2 mice with MRSA USA300. Among the 316 mice, 175 ( 55% ) survived the 7-day study period, while the other 141 ( 45% ) met our euthanasia criteria prior to day 7. Pre-infection weight ( R = 0. 04 ) and infection dose ( R = 0. 05 ) did not correlate with survival ( S1A Fig )

. aureus bacteremia ( SAB ) [11], and approximately one-third of SAB cases lead to sepsis [12, 13]. This variability in disease outcomes after S. aureus colonization, suggests that this host-pathogen interaction may depend on both bacterial and host genetics. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection

. We created a large F2 intercross panel by crossing collaborative cross ( CC ) strains with known phenotypes with respect to MRSA USA300 infection, using a MRSA susceptible strain ( CC061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ). In our previous work we determined that parental CC061 mice rapidly lost weight and met our euthanasia criteria, while CC024 mice lost less weight and survived the study period [31]

. The increased production of IL-10 by CC061 mice may create an anti-inflammatory state that contributes to reduced survival of these mice during MRSA infection. Whether S. aureus itself manipulates IL-10 levels to evade the innate immune system is not clear. Six cytokines were increased after infection in serum of MRSA tolerant CC024 mice, after accounting for pre-infection baseline differences

. In the confidence interval region, the WSB allele contributed to tolerance in CC024 mice, and the C57BL/6J allele contributed to the sensitivity phenotype of CC061 mice ( Fig 4B ). We identified a significant peak on chromosome 7 linked to weight change after infection ( S3A Fig ). We called this peak 24WMI ( CC024 Weight change after MRSA Infection ). The peak was located at 22. 79 MB, with a confidence interval between 13 and 25 MB

. Cytokine and gene expression patterns differed between these strains both before and after infection. In this work we demonstrate that survival in F1 and F2 generation followed a complex dominant pattern of inheritance for the CC024 phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in the parental strains, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection

. Our data suggest that the genetic factors influencing MRSA colonization are well segregated in the F2 generation, and a complex trait controls their interaction. Survival in F2 mice ranged from 2 to 7 days post-infection, with a median of 6 days. Kidney colonization in F2 animals was roughly equivalent, irrespective of the euthanizing day. Thus, most of the F2 mice appear to be tolerant, as they survive the infection with higher bacterial loads ( Fig 4 )

. aureus [41, 42]. Up-regulation of the complement cascade before and after infection in CC024 may play an important role in survival of CC024 mice after infection. Three pathways were up regulated in CC024 mice compared to CC061 mice after MRSA infection ( Fig 6B ). In KEGG, the S. aureus infection pathway is part of the complement and coagulation cascade

. After accounting for strain differences in baseline levels of these cytokines, seven cytokines differ significantly between CC024 mice and CC061 mice post-infection. IL-10 was significantly increased in CC061 mice after MRSA infection ( Fig 2C ), while IL-1β, IL-4, IL-9, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-27 were significantly increased in CC024 mice after infection ( Fig 2C, 2D and 2E )

In our previous study, two CC strains, CC061 and CC024, were infected with MRSA USA300 and monitored for a week after infection [31]. All of the CC061 mice met our euthanasia criteria with a median survival of three days and were classified as susceptible ( Fig 1A ). All the CC024 mice survived until day 7 with high organ colonization and were classified as tolerant ( Fig 1A and 1B ). CC061 mice lost 18% of their body weight on average ( Fig 1C )

. This hypothesis is also consistent with our finding that heterozygotes at these loci survive poorly ( Fig 5B and 5C ) ; a single CC061 allele for one of these receptors may be sufficient to allow activation of the complement system, leading to reduced survival in heterozygotes. These C5ar1 and C5ar2 variants, independently or together, are strong candidates for an important role in the increased survival during MRSA infection of CC024 mice

. Several genes located in this QTL region suggest a mechanism for tolerance to MRSA infection.

. In a recent S. aureus vaccination study, increased levels of IL-10 and reduced IL-17 production lowered the efficiency of the vaccine [64], further supporting important roles for IL-10 in disease outcome after S. aureus infection. We determined that the complement and coagulation cascade pathway is up regulated in CC024 mice both before and after MRSA infection. The complement system is one of the first host defense systems that S. aureus encounters during infection [42]

. Resistance is defined as maintaining health by limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of infection despite a high pathogen burden [14]. Mechanisms underlying tolerance to infection have recently been described for parasitic [15, 16] and viral infections [17]. However, little is known about tolerance to bacterial infections, including S aureus. We identified a QTL on chromosome 7 for survival and weight after MR infection in the F2 generation. The QTL, 24MI ( CC Weight after MR Infection ) was located at 22 79 MB with a confidence interval between 13 and 25 MB. The WSB allele in CC024 contributed to tolerance, while the CBL/6J allele in CC mice contributed to susceptibility ( Fig 4B )
This study investigates how genetic networks influence adaptation during an adaptive walk, focusing on the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of beneficial mutations. Current models of adaptation consider genotype-phenotype relationships, ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. The authors model a trait as the product of a simple gene network, the autoregulatory motif, and use forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive theory is the distribution of fitness of beneficial mutations is exponential. However, both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect alleles than expected. The network model had a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients. This is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Results suggest interactions from genetic networks generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness. 

The study combines biological realism with tools for the evolution of quantitative traits, evaluating the shape of DFE among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks, finding differences from classical expectations in some cases. Understanding genetic influence is an under-explored area, particularly the study of DFE. Both models exhibit similarities in aspects of adaptive walks, the number of steps and distribution effects among fixations beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than additive on average. This was highlighted by a difference in responses to selection, the rate of trait evolution. The study explores a simple network's influence during adaptive scenario, introducing a nonlinear map into adaptive theory. At the foundation of any trait lies a network of genes and regulatory elements controlling expression. Networks can generate epistasis, implications for evolution, recombination, maintenance, and trade-offs between complexity and adaptability.
Researchers propose a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conduct-based neurons and synapses, suggesting they are naturally equipped to optimally integrate information. In this approach, apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. They demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains various findings on single-cell and multi-sens integration, illustrated with simulations. Experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian integration and plasticity are made.

 The biophysics of neurons can be interpreted as Bayesian computations. Conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from Gaussian functions represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior, and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to a target. Before plasticity, specific neuronal dynamics arise from the Bayesian view. Conduct-based integration predicts properties differ from classical models. In absence of input, somatic reflects prior. Dendrites adjust reliability based on past contributing to desired distributions.

 A probabilistic view of single computation shows top-down approach yields same membrane dynamics. Gaussian priors and likelihoods reflect summation of independent inputs yields normal, in agreement with data. Conduct-based integration can be viewed as probabilistic pooling. Each dendrite is an individual with opinion and reliability. Single neurons are equipped with Bay-optimal integration capability. Gradient formulation explains hierarchically organized networks. Inputs from different fields or modalities need to be combined into coherent basis for actions. Bayesian theory provides recipes for optimally solving, but biological implementation unclear.

 The biophysical system computes posterior via evolution. Dendrites represent likelihoods or priors, parametrized by reversal and conduct. Our framework suggests conduct-based coupling enables neurons to perform probabilistic previously thought only at circuit level. Previous studies demonstrated interacting populations perform probabil computations, mechanistic models underlying Bay-opt behavior. Here, probabil may be ingrained in biological, single neurons.

    Abstract: Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets. Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights. Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification, we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. On average, we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. Additionally, we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets.

   . 8% for eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively. This suggests that among larger well-understood protein families, we are seeing a convergence between sequence and structural classifications facilitated by highly accurate structure predictions. At the same time, among homologous groups that are less populated, structural domain classification is still finding domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications

. The resulting domains from these proteomes suggested biological insights for their respective organisms, and they were made available on the ECOD website. The flood of protein predictions after the release of AlphaFold, and the observed domain content relative to unstructured or low-confidence regions, prompted us to examine the behavior of our domain classification more closely on the broadest selection of whole proteomes

. The division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with more distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or regions that are unstructured or have no domains whatsoever will continue to be a useful strategy for grappling with these large structural datasets. Here we classify the domains from 48 whole proteomes available in the AFDB. These proteomes include a wide selection of model organisms such as zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli

. The lower classification rate for domains in eukaryotes from AFDB predicted proteomes has previously been observed [31] and is likely due to some combination of prediction errors as well as contextual errors from regions that are only structured in the context of the correct higher-order multi-domain protein or protein complex. On average, DPAM returned classifications for 98% of the residues attempted ( Fig 1 )

. The widespread access to proteins that were previously difficult or unamenable to structural classification dramatically diminishes the gap between structural and sequence classification. Finally, we illustrate those homologous groups that are enriched by domains and use well-known sequence domain annotations to estimate the degree to which structure prediction of proteins and classification of their domains has expanded our knowledge of previously unknown domains.

Domain classification can reveal functional information by identifying homologous relationships between domains. By classifying whole proteomes, we can determine the prevalence of given homologous domain groups within different organisms as well as determine those domains previously unannotated by sequence methods

. Although the principal goal of ECOD has been the classification of proteins with experimental structures, we have recently demonstrated the utility of ECOD for domain classification in both eukaryotic [27] and bacterial ( Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD ) proteomes. In both cases, ECOD, combined with a recently developed structural domain parser ( DPAM ) for AlphaFold models [29, 30], classified the available residues into either domains or low-confidence and disordered regions

. The domain classification of these proteomes was performed to determine the balance of homologous groups in different organisms, to develop techniques for broadly filtering low-confidence and poorly assigned domains from the final sets, and to establish the performance of both AlphaFold and DPAM on different domains of life. Future domain classification by DPAM of larger data sets will necessarily be on clustered data where full coverage of a given species will not be guaranteed

. We chose whole proteomes as a target for this analysis to understand the behavior of our algorithm on results unbiased by clustering and to observe potential orthologs and paralogs that might be removed by a larger clustering method. In the future, we anticipate that the results herein will guide our target selection for proteins from larger ( and sparser ) data sets. We observed that a lower fraction of individual eukaryotic proteomes was well-assigned ( 57. 6 ± 5

. In total, we classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. By comparison, the reference version of ECOD ( develop285 ) used for classification contained 898, 379 domains from 599, 852 peptide chains in 179, 294 PDB depositions. These domains and their boundaries have been made available on the ECOD website ( http://prodata. swmed. edu/ecod/index_af2. php ) and have been deposited in a Zenodo repository [33]

. For nearly a decade, we have classified domains into our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures using a combination of structural and sequence aligners along with expert curation on selected difficult cases [15, 28]. As opposed to other structural domain classifications, ECOD’s hierarchy is structured to prioritize homology over topology

. 6 ± 5. 5% ) on average than bacteria ( 81. 1 ± 6. 9% ). Because of this difference, we more closely examined the well-assigned domains from those proteomes and enumerated the commonalities and differences among the most populated ECOD homologous groups ( Fig 3 ). Among the eukaryotes, the ARM repeats ( discussed above ), the β-β-α Zinc fingers ( BBA Zn ), the Igl domains, and the HTH domains are the most populated homologous groups ( Fig 3A )

. We examined the length, secondary structure content, and sequence family assignments ( by InterPro/Pfam where available ) of sequence cluster representatives from this set of domains. Although a full manual curation of unassigned domains is the focus of future work, we discuss the properties of domains within this set and illustrate an example of a fast-evolving protein domain that is likely indicative of the types of curation necessary to classify this set

. coli. They also include numerous organisms that cause diseases such as malaria, leprosy, and bacterial pneumonia. We examine the varying population of homologous groups among predictions from whole proteomes and the experimentally characterized protein universe. We also examine the differing classification between eukaryotes and bacteria in these predicted examples

. Domain classification of predictions can rescue regions of the protein that might escape recognition amid an overall low-confidence prediction. Commonalities and differences between the classification of eukaryotes and bacteria The whole proteomes in AFDB can be subdivided by taxonomy into eukaryotes, bacteria, and ( a single ) archaea ( S1 Table ). The eukaryotes include multiple plants ( O. sativa, Z. mays, A. thaliana, G. max ), mammals ( H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, and M

. Moreover, closely associating domains from predictions with experimental data, where possible, is one way to mitigate possible errors from the structure prediction algorithm. The classification of proteins into domains is one potential strategy for grappling with the size and quality of the data offered by large structure prediction efforts

. Protein domain classifications determine and organize these homologous domains [8] and either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam [9], CDD [10], or SUPERFAMILY [11] that partition protein sequence into domains and derive their taxonomy principally by sequence similarity measures or 2 ) structure classifications such as SCOP [12, 13], CATH [14], or ECOD [15] that use structural similarity to determine more distant homology ( at the cost of access to fewer proteins )

. A single member of the archaea, M. jannaschi was also included as a model organism. This set includes five proteomes we previously published as a component of our human classification [27] using an earlier version of our domain partition and assignment algorithm ( DPAM, see Methods ) that has subsequently been improved. They are presented here in the context of comparison to other whole proteomes

. Among the available models, there is a breadth of structure quality, arising from multiple potential causes: 1 ) lack of structural context for multimeric complexes 2 ) biological disorder within proteins 3 ) conformation changes, 4 ) genome annotation, and 5 ) error in structure prediction. We suggest that domain classification from these structures, and positively identifying different types of regions within them, is necessary to use these predictions most effectively

. We classified domains from 48 whole proteomes from AFDB [32] using the DPAM v2 ( Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models ) domain assigner and ECOD develop285 as a reference [28, 29]. The proteomes include a diverse set of organisms such as zebraf, fruit flies, E. coli, and M. jannchi. The classification of these proteomes was performed to determine the balance of homolog groups in different organisms, develop techniques for filtering low-confidence and poorly assigned domains from the sets, and establish the performance of AlphaFold and DPAM on domains of life. Future classification by DPAM of larger sets will be on data where full coverage of a species not guaranteed. We observed a lower fraction of eukotic proteomes well-assigned 57.6 ± 5. In total we classified 746, 349 domains 536 808 proteins comprised over 226 424 000 amino residues. By comparison the version EC develop contained 898 379 domains 599 852 chains 179 294 PDB depositions. These and boundaries made available on EC website and deposited in Zenodo [33]

    Title: 
    Abstract: BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antivirals. The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. Here, we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first. By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication, we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication. Thus, BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection. Together, these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV.

    Using single-cell techniques, our studies revealed that BK polyomavirus depends on the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production. Our data contrasts with the model where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the initial S phase for viral replication. Instead, our data supports a new model whereby BKPyV requires an initial host S phase to replicate, which aligns better with the other small DNA tumor viruses such as papilloma- and adenoviruses [23, 46]

. Since even at early timepoints, robust TAg expression was consistently observed in ≥4N cells, these data suggest that BKPyV production is dependent on an initial S phase. To determine if viral replication depended on an initial host S phase, we used chemical inhibitors to specifically prevent cellular DNA replication

. BKPyV infection is unusual in that the host DNA is re-replicated and maintained re-replication is required for viral replication [8]. To achieve induction into S phase and subsequent re-replication, the current model for BKPyV infection ( Fig 1A ) supposes early TAg expression first causes S phase entry for viral replication. Since viral replication activates the DNA damage response, mitosis is blocked and the cell undergoes re-replication

. Instead, canonical origin licensing and firing mechanisms were required for re-replication and displayed an expected distribution of activity across the cell cycle. Together, these findings change our understanding of the BKPyV life cycle to include the requirement of an initial S phase for robust TAg expression and viral production ( Fig 6 )

. Expression of the late genes revealed that VP2/3 expression followed the robust TAg expression as cells progressed to re-replication ( Fig 1G ), suggesting that infectious virions are formed in re-replicating cells. This agrees with the current model of the BKPyV life cycle, wherein robust expression of TAg precedes expression of the late proteins, but places viral replication after the cell arrived at 4N

. Our analysis of the cell cycle in BKPyV infected RPTE cells revealed that robust expression of TAg was primarily observed in the re-replicating population, which suggested that robust TAg expression depended on an initial host S phase. Indeed, inhibition of host origin licensing or firing prior to re-replication decreased viral titers and prevented TAg expression

. Like what was seen with SCFi, late inhibition of either kinase did not decrease viral titers. Together, these data show that BKPyV requires an initial host S phase for viral production. Since robust levels of TAg were only observed in S phase cells that had ≥4N DNA content ( Fig 1E and 1F ) and suppression of host replication prior to re-replication decreased BKPyV production ( Fig 2A and 2B ), this suggested that BKPyV robustly expresses TAg following the initial S phase

. Together, these data inform a revised BKPyV life cycle, in which BKPyV requires an initial host S phase for robust TAg expression and viral replication during host re-replication.

. Importantly, the re-replication phenotype of the host DNA is also found in kidney biopsies from transplant patients with uncontrolled BKPyV reactivation, in which enormous, TAg+ nuclei are observed [13]. Given this requirement of host re-replication and the evidence of re-replication in vivo, a mechanistic understanding of how BKPyV induces re-replication is required. Human DNA replication is temporally separated into two steps: origin licensing and origin firing [14]

. Using dual-pulse labeling to track an initial S phase population throughout the cell cycle revealed a rapid accumulation of TAg as cells entered G2, which was followed by VP2/3 expression. Since BKPyV required host replication, we investigated if BKPyV infection caused aberrant host licensing, but found that licensing pathways behaved canonically. Similarly, both host origin firing kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2 were required for efficient re-replication

. Therefore, it is unknown how BKPyV induces re-replication without causing increased DNA damage [8], or how the virus blocks mitosis by activating the DDR without also inhibiting Cdc7 and Cdk2 [21]. To understand how BKPyV manages to replicate host DNA despite DDR activation, we used single-cell techniques to characterize the cell cycle during a BKPyV infection of human primary renal kidney epithelial ( RPTE ) cells, which are the site of natural infection in humans

. In agreement with our previous findings, ATMi increased the number of mitotic cells at 4N ( Fig 2H ). Importantly, the overwhelming majority of these mitotic cells displayed robust TAg intensity ( Fig 2H and 2I ), suggesting that TAg expression preceded re-replication. These data show that the robust expression of TAg during a BKPyV infection occurs after the initial S phase induction, but prior to the onset of re-replication. Thus, robust TAg is expressed in late S or G2

. While TAg expression would promote S phase transcription, it is less clear how mitotic suppression is occurring as robust DDR activation was observed after the onset of re-replication. Indeed, it may be possible that BKPyV-induced re-replication represents an endogenous cellular response to infection that BKPyV has evolved to depend upon. This dependence of BKPyV on the host cell re-replication program may also explain the cellular tropism of BKPyV

. While robust TAg expression required an initial S phase, we could not determine if the increase in TAg occurred before or after the onset of re-replication. Previously, we reported that ATM inhibition during a BKPyV-infection caused cells to complete S phase and enter mitosis rather than re-replicating [8]. Therefore, the TAg state of the mitotic cells during ATMi should reveal whether TAg is expressed robustly before re-replication or after

. While BKPyV relies on the host replication machinery to replicate the viral DNA, it provides its own helicase, large tumor antigen ( TAg ) [1]. BKPyV replication using TAg and host replication machinery activates a cascade of kinases known as the DNA damage response ( DDR ), which prolongs S phase and is necessary for robust viral replication [8, 9]

. After the rapid increase in TAg+ cells, the percent of TAg+ cells within the BrdU+ cells plateaued as cells that underwent mitosis did not go on to express TAg. These data show that BKPyV-infected cells robustly express TAg after the initial host S phase and near the onset of re-replication, while cells that did not express TAg underwent mitosis

. While our data agree that TAg expression is observed before the viral capsid proteins, the cells robustly expressing TAg were in late S/G2 rather than G1 even at early times post-infection. Additionally, inhibiting host replication did not result in the accumulation of TAg expression in the G1/early S phase population, but prevented robust TAg expression all together and reduced viral titers; demonstrating that TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase

. Alternatively, TAg mRNA stability may be cell cycle dependent through an unknown mechanism. BKPyV infection of primary cells induces cells to endoreduplicate, whereby the host genome is re-replicated without cells progressing through the cell cycle phases M and G1

. If host replication was inhibited after infected cells had already reached the 4N DNA content and TAg was expressed, host replication was no longer required for maintaining TAg expression or viral production. Proteasome inhibition failed to increase TAg expression suggesting that the increase of BKPyV TAg in G2/M is not due to a shift in protein stability, as has been reported for the related MCPyV [36]

. Unexpectedly, the TAg- cells displayed higher rates of S phase than mock cells ( Fig 3D ), but did not undergo re-replication ( Fig 3E ). One possibility is that these cells are infected and BKPyV is driving S phase induction, but TAg fails to be expressed. However, this is not the case as TAg was observed in cells that had ≥4 DNA content ( Fig 1 and 2 ) and TAg was not observed in cells that had <4 DNA ( Fig 1 and 2 ), suggesting that TAg expression is dependent on host-replication

BKPy is a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no antiviral. The current model is that BKV expresses TAg early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where viral can access host replication machinery. Here we performed single-cell analysis of TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal robust TAg required replication of host first. Using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication we show both TAg and viral production rely on initial phase BKV is known to promote cellular replication where cell re-enters S from G2 ( without passing mitosis or G1 to S for viral replication Thus BKV results in cells with >4 DNA content We found these rounds of replication host relied on canonical cell machinery despite BKV infection Together these suggest a model for polyavirus replication where robust TAg depends on initial host and BKV primarily replicates during host-re Having better understanding of molecular required for BKV will help identify targets against BKV

The final answer is: 
BKPyomavirus (BKV) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no antiviral. The current model is that BKV expresses TAg (T antigen) early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where viral can access host machinery. Here, we performed single-cell analysis of TAg throughout the cycle to reveal robust TAg required host replication first. Using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral, we show both TAg and viral production rely on initial phase. BKV is known to promote cellular replication where cell re-enters S from G2 (without passing through mitosis or G1) to S for viral replication. Thus, BKV results in cells with >4 DNA. We found these rounds of replication host relied on canonical cell machinery despite BKV infection. Together, these suggest a model for polyavirus replication where robust TAg depends on initial host and BKV primarily replicates during host-re. Having a better understanding of molecular required for BKV will help identify targets against BKV.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ). While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time, recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Here, we present FABIO, a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. As a result, FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. In the real datasets, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27. 9%-36. 9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its improved power, FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits.

   . Therefore, modeling multiple genes on an entire chromosome may be advantageous in capturing GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually, thereby potentially increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping. Here, we introduce a novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FABIO ( Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes ) that effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations

In this study, we have presented FABIO, a novel TWAS fine-mapping method tailored for binary outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, FABIO not only incorporates a probit model to capture the binary nature of disease traits but also jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for GReX correlation across genes in different LD blocks. As a result, FABIO produces reasonably calibrated test statistics and achieves high power

. Different from existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches, FABIO explicitly models the binary nature of the outcome trait through a probit model, and simultaneously models all genes on an entire chromosome to account for the GReX correlation both within and between LD blocks, which also reduces the residual error variance to enhance the precision of TWAS fine-mapping. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for model inference, making FABIO scalable to large biobank scale datasets

. We also used the genotype data from the same set of cis-SNPs in UK Biobank to construct the GReX underlying these genes, selected some genes to be causal, and simulated a binary outcome trait of interest in the GWAS. Afterwards, we applied different methods to perform TWAS fine-mapping to identify the causal genes. In the process, we considered a baseline simulation setting and varied one parameter at a time to examine the influence of different parameters on top of the baseline setting

. We refer to our method as FABIO ( Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes ). We conducted simulations to assess the performance of FABIO and compare it with existing fine-mapping methods FOCUS and FOGS. To do so, we used real genotype data and simulated both gene expression and the binary outcome trait. Specifically, we randomly sampled 50, 000 individuals of European ancestry in UK Biobank to serve as the GWAS data

We consider a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) performed on n individuals for a binary trait of interest. We denote y as an n-vector of binary phenotypes measured on the n individuals. Our goal is to identify genes whose genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) is associated with the outcome trait through TWAS fine-mapping

Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits [1–3]. However, the traditional approach of conducting marginal TWAS analyses, which examine one gene at a time, has important limitations

. FABIO relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple GReX to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on a chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FABIO through comprehensive simulations

. To overcome the limitation of marginal TWAS analysis, several statistical methods for TWAS fine-mapping, including FOCUS ( fine-mapping of causal gene sets ) [4] and FOGS ( Fine-mapping Of Gene Sets ) [6], have been developed [7–9]. These TWAS fine-mapping methods can prioritize associated genes by jointly modeling multiple genes within a specific region of interest. The TWAS fine-mapping methods begin by constructing GReX prediction models using data from eQTL mapping studies [2, 10]

. We also applied FABIO to analyze six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank dataset, where FABIO was able to narrow down a small set of causal genes, with the set size 27. 9–36. 9% smaller than those yielded by current TWAS fine-mapping methods. Notably, FABIO prioritized multiple candidate genes previously validated for their association with the respective diseases, such as GATA3 for asthma; ABCG2 for gout; and SH2B3 for hypertension

. We retained a total of 14, 388 genes that contained at least 10 cis-SNPs for TWAS fine-mapping analysis. For a given trait in UKBB, we kept all individuals of European ancestry with self-reported case status of that trait in the GWAS data. Same as the simulations, we used BSLMM to construct GReX prediction models for FABIO, FOCUS, and GIFT, and used the elastic net regression for FOGS and cTWAS following the recommendation from its developer

. 25 genes per replicate, respectively. Next, we examined a more challenging null simulation setting where the causal genes were not included in the analysis. Under this setting, because the null genes may display gene expression correlation with the causal genes and may have cis-SNP overlap with them, the null genes will display marginal TWAS signals and could be falsely identified to be causal in the fine-mapping analysis

. We performed TWAS fine-mapping analysis on six binary disease traits through integrating the eQTL mapping study of GEUVADIS and the GWAS of UK Biobank ( details in Material and Methods ). Specifically, we focused on 14, 388 genes residing in 1, 433 independent LD blocks and examined their associations with each of the six binary traits

. The constructed prediction models are then used to impute GReX in GWAS, enabling the association testing between GReX and the trait of interest at the locus level. Different TWAS fine-mapping methods employ distinct modeling frameworks. Specifically, FOCUS, a Bayesian method, specifies a sparsity-inducing prior on gene effect sizes on the outcome trait and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) for modeling inference

. With the SNP weights, we directly constructed GReX in the GWAS data for FABIO and GIFT, then carried out TWAS fine-mapping analysis. For the other three methods, we performed marginal association analysis in the GWAS data with logistic regression using PLINK 2. 0 [53] to first obtain GWAS summary statistics. We then paired the GWAS summary statistics with the SNP weights as inputs for them. For those methods, we calculated the LD matrix using the same set of individuals in UKBB.

. Consequently, employing linear regression as an approximation to logistic regression in TWAS fine-mapping settings may not accurately capture the binary nature of the outcome, potentially leading to a loss of power. The second limitation of existing TWAS fine-mapping methods is that they only consider the correlation among GReX within local genomic regions defined by LD blocks

. Specifically, we applied the three TWAS fine-mapping methods using only half of the samples for the same six traits and examined whether the results obtained in such reduced sample analysis is consistent with full sample analysis. We found that FABIO identified more gene candidates that lied in the GWAS or TWAS risk regions than FOCUS and FOGS in the reduced sample analysis ( S3 Table )

. The number in the bracket is the number of identified genes that are located in a risk region with GWAS or TWAS signals. We used an estimated FDR threshold of 0. 05 to declare significance for all methods in the fine-mapping analysis. Next, we performed TWAS fine-mapping using FABIO, FOCUS and FOGS on all 14, 388 genes from the 1, 433 independent LD blocks

. Secondly, similar to FOCUS and FOGS, FABIO adopts a two-stage fitting strategy for TWAS fine-mapping: it relies on a reference eQTL study to predict GRe and then uses the predicted GRe in GWAS to test the association between GRe and the trait. However, unlike FOCUS and FOG, FIO uses a probit model to capture the binary nature of the trait and models all genes on chromosome to account for GRe correlation among genes in LD

    Title: 
    Abstract: Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined, particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants. We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. [PSI+] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form. Instead, both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity. Taken together, our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation.

   . In this current study we have investigated the roles of the Hsp42 and Btn2 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein misfolding and aggregation [18, 19]

. This was significantly increased following hydrogen peroxide exposure for both sequestrases suggesting that Btn2 and Hsp42 play a role in triaging aggregated proteins formed during oxidative stress conditions ( Fig 3B ). Since Hsp104 appears to be required to protect against protein aggregation during the response to oxidative stress, but its cellular concentrations remain unaltered during these stress conditions, we hypothesised that Hsp104 may become limiting in btn2 hsp42 mutants

. Our data identify the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases as key chaperones required for oxidant tolerance that are required to sequester misfolded proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure. The proper sequestration of aggregates is an important defence strategy that prevents the dysfunction and toxicity that is associated with protein misfolding diseases

. In agreement with this idea, we show that btn2 hsp42 mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress implicating a functional role for protein sequestration in oxidant tolerance. Together, our data show that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases act to protect against widespread amorphous and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative stress conditions.

. We show that the levels of protein oxidative damage formed in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants, but protein aggregation is elevated suggesting that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cells antioxidant defence system

. The finding that mutants lacking Btn2 and Hsp42 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress, but not heat stress, suggests a more direct functional requirement for these sequestrases during stress conditions that promote protein oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide stress is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein aggregation [18, 19]. All amino acids in proteins are potential targets of oxidation

. These data indicate that whilst protein oxidation is elevated in sequestrase mutants during non-stress conditions, elevated levels of oxidatively damaged proteins do not appear to accumulate in sequestrase mutants that might explain the sensitivity of the double btn2 hsp42 mutant to oxidative stress. We next examined whether protein aggregation is altered in sequestrase mutants to explain their sensitivity to oxidative stress

. In the absence of Hsp42 and Btn2, protein sequestration is deficient and non-specific protein aggregates accumulate in cells. These aggregates are targeted by Hsp104 and other chaperones, but non-specific aggregates ultimately overwhelm the protein homeostasis machinery resulting in sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions

. Taken together, these data indicate that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to protect against protein aggregation caused by oxidative stress conditions in a mechanism that requires the Hsp104 disaggregase. Most studies that have examined protein misfolding and aggregation in sequestrase mutants have relied on model PQC reporter substrates and little is known regarding the in vivo substrates of these chaperones

. The irreversible nature of many types of protein oxidation may also require sequestration as a strategy to prevent protein aggregates from accumulating at non-specific sites as we observed in btn2 hsp42 mutants. The sequestration of misfolded proteins is thought to protect the proteome against an overload of protein misfolding

. However, no increases in Btn2 or Hsp42 protein levels were observed in response to hydrogen peroxide stress suggesting that the basal levels of these sequestrases are sufficient to promote oxidant tolerance ( Fig 1B ). In comparison, Btn2 and Hsp42 protein levels were increased by 12-fold and 2. 3-fold respectively, in response to a 37°C heat stress ( Fig 1B )

. To test this idea, HSP104 was over-expressed under the control of the constitutively active TDH3 promoter [14] in wild-type and btn2 hsp42 mutant strains. Whilst overexpression of HSP104 did not affect the hydrogen peroxide tolerance of the wild-type strain, the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of the btn2 hsp42 mutant was improved ( Fig 3C ). This suggests that Hsp104 can become limiting in sequestrase mutant during oxidative stress conditions that promote protein misfolding and aggregation

. To further confirm that overexpression of Hsp104 rescues the oxidant sensitivity of btn2 hsp42 mutants by protecting against the toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation in the absence of sequestrase activity, we directly examined protein aggregation in wild-type and sequestrase mutants. Insoluble protein aggregates were separated from soluble proteins by differential centrifugation and any contaminating membrane proteins removed by detergent washes [24, 26, 27]

Given the lack of sensitivity of sequestrase mutants to heat stress conditions, we examined whether Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress, as another stress condition that causes protein misfolding and aggregation. For these experiments we used single hsp42 and btn2 mutants as well as a double btn2 hsp42 mutant. We first confirmed that mutants lacking BTN2 or HSP42 are unaffected in temperature sensitivity ( Fig 1A )

. Hsp104 is the main cellular disaggregase that mediates refolding from the aggregated state and can be used to visualize the sites of protein aggregate formation in cells [21–24]. We hypothesized that Hsp42 and Btn2-mediated sequestration might normally act to triage oxidized proteins and their absence would therefore lead to an accumulation of protein aggregates in hsp42 btn2 mutants

. In agreement with this idea, we found that overexpressing Hsp104 improved oxidant tolerance in btn2 hsp42 mutants. Increasing Hsp104 levels in a wild-type strain did not affect oxidant tolerance indicating that Hsp104 levels are normally sufficient to protect against an oxidative stress when sequestrases are active

. For the hsp42 and btn2 hsp42 mutants, protein aggregation was further increased in response to oxidative stress compared with the wild-type during oxidative stress conditions ( Fig 2B ). This was particularly apparent for the btn2 hsp42 mutant strains where 30% cells contained multiple Hsp104-marked aggregates

. Protein aggregation was strongly increased in the btn2 hsp42 mutant and again Hsp104 overexpression reduced the cellular levels of protein aggregation. Hsp104 overexpression also appeared to cause alterations in the protein aggregates detected in the btn2 hsp42 mutant particularly under oxidative stress ( Fig 3D ). Western blotting was used to confirm that Hsp104 is similarly overexpressed in wild-type and btn2 hsp42 mutants ( Fig 3D )

. The oxidant-induced, increased Sup35 aggregation detected in btn2 hsp42 mutants required the Sup35 PrD which has previously been implicated in the formation of non-amyloid Sup35 phase separated aggregates during nutrient depletion stress conditions [51]. Our model is that soluble proteins, such as Sup35, undergo misfolding in response to oxidative damage, and the oxidatively damaged proteins are normally triaged by Btn2 and Hsp42 to the various protein deposit sites in cells ( Fig 7 )

. Using this assay, we found that protein carbonylation is elevated by approximately 50% in a wild-type strain in response to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide exposure ( Fig 2A ). The basal levels of protein carbonylation were increased in the btn2, hsp mutant during non-stress conditions ( Fig 2A ). However, the levels of oxidatively damaged proteins did not accumulate in btn2 hsp mutants during oxidative stress ( Fig 2 ) suggesting that the sequeases act to triage oxidatively damaged proteins during oxidative conditions

We found that Sup35 is an in vivo substrate of Btn2 and Hsp sequeases and that these chaperones suppress the formation of the amyloid form of Sup35, the [PSI] prion ( Fig 5 ). The [PS] pr is an amyloid form of the translation termination factor Sup35 that forms in response to nutrient stress [51, 52]. The formation of the [PS] pr is thought to occur at the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to form heritable prions. However, we found that [PS] pr formation in btn hsp mutants does not require the IPO site ( Fig 5 ) suggesting that prion formation occurs at multiple sites during oxidative stress in the absence of sequease activity

We also found that both amorph and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn hsp mutants ( Fig 5 ) consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress in the absence of sequease activity. This is in contrast to the idea that prion formation occurs at the IPO site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to form heritable prions. Our data indicate that protein seque is a key antioxidant mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein-induced aggregation during oxidative stress.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes, while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ), transcripts without protein-coding potential, for role in GBM invasion. We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel. Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis. Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments. Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33–83% decrease in invasion ( p<0. 01 ) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, identified from effect size and p-value, demonstrated 82. 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade ( p<0. 0001 ). RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3, previously implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lncRNA expression, while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. Finally, WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD. CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to GBM invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3.

    To efficiently identify novel lncRNAs in GBM that affect the invasive ability of malignant cells and determine possible therapeutic targets, we developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen. Here we report the first large-scale CRISPRi screen on lncRNAs implicated in glioblastoma invasion. Our results identified LINC03045 as significantly associated with in vitro glioma cell invasion across 3 tumor lines

. These pools of lncRNA cellular perturbation are then selected for those cells displaying a phenotype of interest. Association of the specific lncRNAs knocked down in remaining selected cells then identifies the lncRNAs that are most closely associated with the selected phenotype. Here, we developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen to identify lncRNAs that affect the in vitro invasive capacity of glioma cells

To screen for and identify lncRNAs affecting in vitro glioma cell invasion, we utilized an invasion screen with CRISPRi as a tool for gene knockdown. Repression of transcription occurred when CRISPRi recruited the Cas9 protein fused to a KRAB repressor ( dCas9-KRAB ), which is guided and targeted to transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) by single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) [19]

. In this screen of 2, 307 candidate lncRNAs, we sought to identify specific lncRNAs associated with glioma cell invasion. We further assess the clinical association of candidate lncRNAs with tumor grade and patient outcomes while also evaluating potential mechanisms by finding associations of candidate lncRNAs with potential coding genes affecting GBM invasion.

. After utilizing a large-scale functional CRISPRi invasion screen, LINC03045 was identified to regulate in vitro invasion of multiple GBM cell lines. Subsequent evaluation of patient clinical data reveals significant associations between LINC03045 and tumor grade, as well as patient survival. Analysis of patient data, tumor cell lncRNA knockdown, and WASF3 knockdown reveal that WASF3 mediates the LINC03045 tumor effect

. Prior studies on lncRNAs in GBM invasion, however, remain scarce, and our study uniquely addresses the role of lncRNAs specifically in GBM invasion, suggesting that noncoding RNAs play a significant functional role in this phenotype. Knockdown of our candidate lncRNA via multiple methods, including via both CRISPRi and ASO, revealed similar decreases in tumor invasion while not affecting tumor proliferation

. To identify novel genetic therapeutic targets in cancer treatment, systematic functional screens have recently been successfully employed to rapidly and efficiently identify transcripts could sensitize cancer cells to treatment. Despite the rapidly emerging use of these functional screens to identify novel genetic targets, few studies have specifically identified novel candidate lncRNAs targeting glioma

. While prior manuscripts have notably focused on the role of coding genes affecting glioma invasion [32], the body of literature characterizing the role of lncRNAs in GBM pathogenesis has only just begun to grow in recent years and have primarily focused on the role of lncRNAs in GBM proliferation and progression [33–37]

. The limited efficacy of treatment options necessitates novel therapeutic strategies and molecular targets that can limit this tumor invasion and subsequent tumor recurrence. While current genetic studies in glioma research have primarily focused on targeting coding genes, about 80% of the genome is composed of non-coding RNAs [9, 10]

. Multiple methods of lncRNA knockdown further validated the functional role of LINC03045 via CRISPRi-based and ASO-based knockdown in all three lines. Patient gene expression analysis of TCGA, and GTEx raw transcriptional data revealed that LINC03045 expression was associated with tumor grade and patient survival, as well as widespread changes in global gene expression data, including oxidative phosphorylation and RNA processing

. 5, sgRNA2: p = 0. 4 ) ( Fig 3B ). To assess a whether a second KD method for LINC03045 is associated with decreased malignant glioma cell invasion and to utilize a drug-based method with translational potential, antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) were utilized for LINC03045 KD in three glioma cell lines: a patient-derived tumor line, USC02, and two commercial lines, U87 and U251

. In the non-invading cells, 45 gene targets were significantly enriched in the library, which represents genes that are necessary for glioma cell invasion. Positive hits were identified through this process, and the top candidate was identified as LINC03045 ( annotation LH02236 ) on chromosome 10

. While lncRNA-based prognostic and diagnostic markers and lncRNA-based therapeutics described above are still in their experimental stages, the study of lncRNAs often offers insight into mechanisms regulating tumor phenotypes such as, in our study, invasion

. Notably, our experimental data was also confirmed to be clinically relevant, as TCGA and GTEx analysis showed that LINC03045 expression is higher in GBM ( grade 4 ) than in LGG ( grades 2–3 ), and higher in LGG when compared to normal cortical tissue. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all gliomas ( LGG and GBM ) showed patients with higher LINC03045 expression were associated with decreased survival

. DESeq2 was used to calculate to calculate the significance of LINC03045 differential expression between the glioma datasets and control, against a backdrop distribution of all other chromosome 10 genes. Information on WHO grade and molecular subtype ( e. g. IDH status ) of the GBM and LGG cohorts from TCGA were obtained from a prior study[63]. Kaplan-Meier ( KM ) survival curve and log-rank test were performed for all gliomas ( LGG and GBM ), LGG and GBM

. Finally, gene expression analysis following LINC03045 KD revealed that WASF3, a factor evaluated for tumor cell invasion in multiple studies, could be a possible mediator of LINC03045 function [30, 31]. Mechanistic studies supported the role of WASF3 as a lncRNA mediator, with WASF3 KD paralleling invasion loss seen with LINC03045 KD in both 2D Matrigel and 3-dimensional invasion modles

. Prior literature has shown that lncRNA expression has been associated with GBM outcome in multiple studies and has been explored in other lncRNAs as a biomarker for prognosis [11, 43]. Thus, further study of these findings may reveal the role of LINC03045 expression in resected patient tumors as a prognostic biomarker

. In addition, our study initially screened CRISPRi lncRNA knockdowns within a commercial tumor cell line, U87. The 24-hour screen of a patient-derived cell line proved challenging due to difficulties achieving stable transfection of both the dCas9 and sgRNA plasmids

. Finally, WASF3 rescue experiments confirmed that WASF3 overexpression restores loss-of-invasion from lncRNA KD. The CRISPRi invasion screen of 2, 307 loci identified 45 hits that affect GBM invasion. Upon evaluation of these candidate hits, LINC03045, a previously unannotated and poorly studied lncRNA, was noted to be significantly associated with invasion

. Our study does carry limitations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is a robust tool for lRNA knockdown, it is not without its limitations, such as off-target effects and mosaic effects [ 45, 46]. In addition, our screen was limited to 2, 307 lncRNAs, which is a small fraction of the total lncRNAs in the human genome [9, 10]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of other lncRNAs in glioblastoma invasion

In conclusion, our CRPR-based screen identified LINC45, a novel lncRNA associated with glioblastoma invasion. LINC45 expression is associated with tumor grade and patient survival. Mechanistic studies suggest that L030 may regulate invasion via WAS3, a previously implicated in tumor invasion. This study highlights the role of lRNAs in glioblast invasion and the potential of L030 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target

The final answer is: 

A CRISPR-interference (CRPR) was used to evaluate the invasive function of glioblastoma (GB)-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in an unbiased screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. Forty lncRNAs were significantly associated with a 33–83% decrease in invasion (p < 0.01) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC45, identified by size and p-value, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while LINC45 expression was significantly associated with patient and tumor grade (p < 0.0001). RNA analysis of LINC45 knock revealed WAS3, previously implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS3 KD was associated with significant in invasion. Finally, WAS3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive lost function with L45 KD. CRPR screening identified L45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest this novel lRNA may regulate via WAS3.
Researchers used a new clustering procedure to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic process. The goal was to identify the putative model the brain assigns to the sequence of stimuli. The procedure groups EEG signals by their law, employing a dissimilarity measure based on the Kolmogorov-Smir distance. Results indicate the prefrontal cortex uses the occurrence of a strong beat in the sequence to build a model of the sequence. The brain selects a partition of the past of the sequence with four clusters, defined by the last occurrence of the beat. Clustering has two stages: individual, grouping segments of EEG per participant, and a consensus procedure to summarize individual results. Consensus clustering has been used in neuroscience to obtain stable and reliable groupings. The sequence used in the experiment can be characterized by the recurrent occurrence of a strong unit. The brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences and organizes them to classify stimuli and make predictions. A partition of the past with four elements is an economical representation of the sequence. The use of the strong to model the sequence indicates the brain identifies structural aspects to estimate the next event amidst stochasticity.

    Title: 
    Abstract: While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e., the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, “cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ”. Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In this study, we address and overcome these limitations/problems associated with solid tissues/organs by developing a method to compute coefficients, cell type-specific weighting-factors ( cWFs ), to offset the transcriptome size- and cell dissociation/processing-induced problem. Furthermore, we also calculate cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs and use them to illustrate their diagnostic and biological utilities.

. We validate the computed cWFs by five methods: 1 ) Reconstitution ( Figs 4 and S2–S5 ), 2 ) deconvolution ( Figs 5 and 6 ) of the whole-organ RNAseq data using their composite scRNA-seq data, 3 ) the comparison of the cWFs to the experimentally measured transcript-contents ( Figs 7 and S6 ), 4 ) independence of cWFs from differential cell-type ratios ( S7 Fig ), and 5 ) prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data ( S8 Fig )

Since the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) technologies early this century, this method is becoming one of the essential tools in biomedical fields [1]. While scRNA-seq provides useful information of cellular composition and gene expression at single cell resolution, it has limitations. It is well-known that the total number of RNA molecules per cell, also known as transcriptome-size, varies from-cell-to-cell [2–4]

In this study, we report a computational method to calculate cWFs, coefficients to offset the lack of the representation of transcriptome size variations and differential cryptic gene expression among different cells of solid organs ( Fig 2 ). Using this method, we computed and describe cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 organs ( Fig 3 )

. We show that they indeed account for the relative variations of the transcriptome-size of the cells and their differential cryptic gene expression by demonstrating their requisite role for accurately reconstituting and deconvolving the whole-organ RNA-seq data using their composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs ( Figs 4–6 ). We also show that they recapitulate the experimentally-determined total mRNA content-differences, using PBMC data ( Fig 7 )

First, the major premise is as follows. If the transcriptome size differences and the cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression ( abbreviated as “cryptic gene expression” hereafter for convenience ) are corrected in the conventional scRNA-seq, the bulk ( i. e., tissue/organ ) RNA-seq should be the sum of gene expression of each composite cell-type weighted by cell-type ratios. We evaluated this premise

. The reconstitution and deconvolution results demonstrate that cWFs enable the accurate representation of individual cells in the context of the whole-organs of highly heterogeneous compositions, presumably by weighting the variations of the transcriptome-size of different cell-types. We further validate this account by directly comparing the cWFs variations to those of the experimentally-determined total mRNA-contents of the corresponding cell-types

. Despite the usefulness of cWFs, some limitations must be noted. While our method is effective for the organs consisting of heterogeneous cell-types, it is ineffective for a relatively homogenous organ such as the liver consisting of predominantly hepatocytes ( >95% ) ( Figs 3, 5, S4, and S5 ). Another limitation could be the requirement of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of the organs and the tissues of interest

. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm to compute such unrepresented factors ( Fig 2 ). The concept of the algorithm is schematically described in Fig 2 and as follows: In the real scRNA-seq data analyses, the total transcript counts per cell ( i. e., the transcriptome-size ) of the real scRNA-seq data are normalized ( i. e., the total counts per cell are equal among all composite cell-types of the organs )

. The similar improvement was found with additional organ RNA-seq datasets ( S3 Fig ), further supporting the notion that the method does not necessarily require both whole-organ RNA-seq and the corresponding scRNA-seq data at the same time. In fact, the relative differences of cWFs among the composite cell-types of each organ remained similar regardless of the organ RNA-seq datasets ( Figs 3, S4, and S5 )

. We then summed these weighted transcript counts for all composite cell-types of each organ according to their ratios to construct the synthetic whole-organ RNA-seq ( syn-woRNAseq ( +cWF ) ), data. Then, they are compared to the corresponding real whole-organ RNA-seq ( r-woRNAseq ) data

. We next evaluated whether our method always requires the exactly matched organ ( bulk ) -RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data of the organ of interest. For this purpose, we performed the deconvolution of the heart RNA-seq data of a myocardial infarction model [26, 47], using the cWFs of the normal heart ( i. e

. For the 13, 135 genes, we normalized all bulk and scRNA-seq count data to count per million. These preprocessed datasets were used for further analyses as described below. The reference cell-type ratios were as described in each original single-cell study, except for the mouse heart, the mouse brain, and the human PBMC and HEK293T/Jurkat cells

. However, in scRNA-seq analyses, the transcripts are sequenced in individual cells and their transcript-counts are normalized, allowing the comparison of the relative abundance of each transcript-species across individual cells/cell-types [5–9]. This internal normalization process of the analyses cancels out the putative transcriptome size-variations among different cells, concealing potentially important functional differences among the cells

. Briefly, the synthetic whole-organ RNA-seq data are calculated as the sum of the normalized transcript counts weighted by the known ratios of the composite cell-types of the organs, using the signature genes for distinguishing the cell-types for each organ ( see “Datasets”, “Data preprocessing”, “Calculation of reference cell-type ratios”, “Selection of signature gene sets” at the bottom of this section for the details )

. t. wj≥0 ( 2 ) Here, S is the number of whole-organ RNA-seq count data. This quadratic problem was solved by using ‘osqp’ package in R. The process of both random-selection of the cell subject combination and w˜j calculation was recursively performed until more than 100 wj were generated for all selected cell subjects. The result shows significant variations of the cWFs among different cell-types in many of the organs, uncovering the body-wide degree of such variations ( Fig 3 )

. Furthermore, we examined whether such putative changes of the cWFs actually indicate the progression of aging. For this purpose, we used the Tabula Muris Senis, the atlas of the multiple-organ single-cell transcriptomics across multiple aging stages of mouse [27, 29] ( see also “Datasets” in the previous Description of the Methods section for the details ). This atlas provides both the whole-organ RNA-seq data and their corresponding composite scRNA-seq data

. For this purpose, we computed the cWFs using the bulk RNA-seq data of two cell-types that are mixed to the predetermined differential ratios ( S7 Fig ) ( see also “Datasets”, “Data preprocessing”, “Selection of signature gene sets” in the previous Description of the Methods section for the details ). In this analysis, we used the bulk RNA-seq data derived from the samples where HEK293T and Jurkat cells are mixed to the ratios of 20: 80 and 80: 20 [10]

. In contrast, they are not applicable to solid tissues/organs composed of highly heterogeneous cell types. Individual cells can be dissociated from solid tissues/organs and then analyzed by scRNA-seq. However, this dissociation induces cryptic gene expression and transcript-size variations among the cells, leading to discrepancy between bulk-seq and reconstituted bulk-se data using sc-se data. This is a major limitation of scRNA-se analysis of complex tissues/organs. We address this problem by developing a method to compute cell-type weighting factors ( cWF ) to offset transcript-size variations and dissoci/processing-induced crypt gene expression. We computed cWF for 76 cell-types across 10 organs and validated their fidelity by reconstitution and deolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and cWF. We also show that c effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic and biological utilities. Our study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of solid/organs and suggest biological significance of c. 

The final answer is: 

This study addresses the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in analyzing complex tissues and organs by developing a method to calculate cell-specific weighting factors (cWF) to account for transcript size variations and dissociation-induced gene expression. The authors computed WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs and validated their fidelity by reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using sc-se data and WF. They also showed that WF predict aging progression, indicating diagnostic and biological significance. This study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of solid organs and suggests biological significance of WF.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously. MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core IV assumptions. Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants. Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a radial formulation of MVMR, and an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised. Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR. We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy. We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). In combination with simulated examples, we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package. Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates, and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. 

    Supporting Text:
    Radial MR and MVMR approaches facilitate the assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS summary data. Conducting analyses within a radial framework allows for outliers to be effectively visualised, and MVMR analyses allow for the direct effects of multiple exposures to be estimated simultaneously

. This makes visual inspection of outliers, or comparison of effects challenging. In this paper we present a Radial MVMR approach which allows for visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and identification of SNPs that are outlying based on their association with all of the exposures. We then show how Radial MVMR can be used to prune outliers and so obtain results that are not influenced by outlying SNPs

. RMVMR plots are particularly useful as a tool for highlighting the extent to which individual SNPs contribute towards global heterogeneity with respect to each included exposure. Performing a univariable MR analyses will result in biased estimates where SNPs are associated with multiple causally relevant phenotypes

. We used these to estimate the direct effect of each exposure in a single model with radial MVMR, estimate exposure specific heterogeneity statistics and conditional F-statistics to test instrument strength. We finally applied pruning to remove any SNPs that contributed more to the heterogeneity statistics than would be expected by chance and re-estimated the radial MVMR model without them included. Results from all of the analyses conducted are presented in Table 4

. For each exposure, univariable radial MR analyses are performed, after which radial MVMR models including all exposures are fit to the data. We identified SNPs strongly associated with each exposure ( p < 5 × 10−8 ). Independent SNPs were retained using a linkage disequilibrium clumping threshold of R2 < 0. 001, and palindromic SNPs were also removed prior to performing analyses

. Radial MR estimates for each individual exposure are presented in Table 1, while univariable radial plots are provided in Figs A—E in S2 Text. In Table 1 we can see that effect estimates exhibit substantial bias when estimated using univariable radial IVW. The high Q-statistics estimated for each exposure provide evidence of heterogeneity in estimates obtained using each instrument individually, suggesting potential violations of assumption IV3

. We then show how the application of Radial MVMR can be used to visualise the MVMR results and to obtain more robust effect estimates through the identification and removal of SNPs which contribute more to heterogenetiy in the MVMR results than would be expected by chance. Throughout we perform all analyses using the RMVMR R package for the R software environment, which has been developed to facilitate the application of radial MVMR analyses

Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a methodological framework in which genetic variants- often single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - are used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding [1, 2]. MR analyses are often performed using summary data from publicly available genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), reflecting the ease with which such data can be accessed in contrast with individual-level data [3]

. Radial MVMR builds upon both these existing methods, providing a means for visualising MVMR approaches absent until this point, and an approach of outlier identification and removal in a MVMR framework. We propose that the radial MVMR approach be used to assist in communicating key findings as a visual aid, and also as a sensitivity analysis for identifying pleiotropic bias using adjusted heterogeneity statistics

In univariable MR analyses one or more SNPs are used as instruments to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure X upon an outcome Y. Let Gj represent the jth independent SNP from a set of j ∈ {1, 2, …, J}, and let U denote one or more unmeasured confounders. A SNP is considered valid provided it satisfies assumptions IV1–3, with assumed relationships depicted in Fig 1

. 05. MVMR extends the univariable MR framework to include multiple potentially correlated exposures, leveraging the entire set of SNPs associated with at least one included exposure [8, 10]. This allows for the direct effect of each exposure to be consistently estimated, ( that is, the effect of an exposure holding the others fixed ), provided that the MVMR assumptions hold; These assumption are illustrated in Fig 2

. When implementing the Radial MVMR approach it is crucial to consider the underlying assumptions of MVMR. Instruments selected should be sufficiently strong so as to overcome substantial weak instrument bias, estimated using the conditional F-statistic. Specific to Radial MVMR, the correction of individual ratio estimates is reliant upon unbiased estimates of the direct effect of each exposure

. The univariable radial MR model can be readily extended to include multiple exposures, creating an analogue of the MVMR regression model shown in Eq 12: β ^ 1 j ( w 1 j ) = β I V W 1 ( w 1 j ) ) + β I V W 2 w 2 j + … + β I V W K w K j + ϵ j ( 12 ) where wkj represents the weighting for each SNP with respect to exposure k

. As demonstrated in the simulation study, if the majority of the SNPs have pleiotropic effects in the same direction the outlier adjusted Radial MVMR estimates will still be biased. As previously emphasised, care should be taken to consider identified outliers and phenotypic associations which could plausibly form horizontal pleiotropic pathways

. Causal effect estimates and tests for pleiotropic instruments can then be performed using the ivw_rmvmr ( ) and pleiotropy_rmvmr ( ) functions. Finally, the plot_rmvmr ( ) function can be used to construct RMVMR plots. Outliers are detected based on their contribution to heterogeneity after adjustment, and are calculated with respect to each individual exposure

. SNPs that contribute to this heterogeneity by more than would be expected by chance are often considered to be outliers and their role in any potential pleiotropic effects investigated further. [5, 6] Radial MR has previously been proposed as a method for MR that allows for visualisation and removal of outliers, as measured by the SNPs that contribute more than expected by chance to heterogeneity in the analysis [7]

. The mean effect estimate, standard error, Q-statistic and F-statistic for each exposure estimated by Radial MVMR with and without outliers removed are given in Table 2 with balanced pleiotropy and Table 3 for unbalanced pleiotropy. Each simulation has a sample size of 100, 000 and 1000 repetitions

. This weighting is given by; w k j = γ ^ k, j σ ^ Y j 2 ( 13 ) Where γ ^ k j is defined as before and σ ^ Y j 2 is the estimated variance of the association between the outcome Y and SNP j. An immediate benefit of conducting MVMR within a radial framework is plotting β ^ k j w k j against w k j can be accomplished using generalised axes scales, allowing ratio estimates for each exposure to be projected onto the same scatter plot simultaneously

. To visualise the extent to which the addition of an exposure minimises effect estimate heterogeneity, a pair of RMVMR plots can be constructed. Initially an RMVMR plot is created including regression lines showing the MVMR estimate for each exposure. For the first plot, each data point shows the the square root weighting for each instrument ( w k j ), and the product of the square root weighting and unadjusted ratio estimate for each exposure

. We now consider the effect of removing SNPs that contribute to heterogeneity more than expected by chance, and re-estimating the MVM model without them. This can be done using the prune function in the RMVR package, which removes SN that contribute to heterogeneity more than would be expected by chance, and re-estimates the MVM model without them. This is shown in the second RMR plot, where each point represents the square weighting for each instrument and the product of the square weighting and adjusted estimate for each exposure. The difference between the two plots shows the effect of removing SNPs that contribute to heterogeneity more than expected by chance

Radial MVM can be used to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) using data from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4C4C GWAS. We used the RM package to estimate the effect of each lipid fraction on CHD. The results are shown in Table 4, with the effect of each lipid on CHD estimated using univar MR and MVM. The effect of each lipid on CHD estimated using RadialMR with and without outliers is shown in Table 5. The effect of each lipid on CHD estimated using Radial with outliers removed is shown in Table 6. The effect of each lipid on CH estimated using Radial with outliers removed is shown in Table 7. The effect of each lipid on CH estimated using Radial with outliers removed is shown in Table 8. The effect of each lipid on CH estimated using Rad with outliers removed is shown in Table 9.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.

   . Additionally, we find a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days. We identify the hour after dawn as ethologically unique, and show that this time point appears to track the general behavioral health of the flies. Our high-resolution data also reveals a difference in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily appearing in the grooming component of behavior

. melanogaster circadian cycle, and find distinct daily patterns in all measured behaviors, including grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion speed. We see an overall decline in the difference in behavior between day and night hours across days in the experiment as flies weaken and die, similar to the known weakening of circadian rhythms with age

. An important aspect of animal behavior is how different timescales interact, from hours to days to lifespans. Investigating these interactions requires a model organism with a broad variety of behaviors but a short lifespan, to allow us to capture the breadth of all the timescales it might inhabit. Drosophila melanogaster have a rich set of behaviors, many of which are spontaneous and can occur in simple, isolated environments. Over the course of a 24-h light/dark cycle D

. Previous behavioral studies of the D. melanogaster diurnal cycle have used relatively coarse metrics, such as the activity counts generated by Drosophila Activity Monitors [9]. These studies have shown that D. melanogaster have peaks of locomotion activity around their subjective morning and evening, with the increase in activity slightly anticipating the actual change in lighting conditions [5, 6]

. We recorded 47 freely moving D. melanogaster using constant IR illumination and an IR-sensitive camera at a frame rate of 100Hz, with a 12-h visible-light day/night cycle. We tracked 14 body parts from each fly using SLEAP [19] and utilized MotionMapper [11], an unsupervised machine-learning method, to develop data-driven definitions of stereotyped behavioral states, such as grooming, locomoting, and proboscis extension

. We leveraged our high-resolution behavior data to carry out an in-depth analysis of the daily pattern of D. melanogaster behavior, focusing on the first day of the experiment when the diurnal cycle was strongest ( Fig 2C ). Flies were reared from embryos to two day old adults with the same light/dark cycle time and phase as the experiments. Even before enclosing, D

. As flies age and die in our experiment, their proboscis extension bout length decreases, perhaps revealing an age- or stress-related attenuation of deep sleep. By investigating locomotion speed specifically during locomotion bouts, we find that locomotion speed, in addition to the fraction of time spent locomoting, has a daily pattern that matches the pattern of activity found in previous circadian studies

. melanogaster behavioral assays [5]. In Drosophila Activity Monitors, activity counts are recorded each time a fly crosses an infrared beam [9], and these counts could increase due to a combination of increased movement time and increased movement speed. Here, we are able to separate these two factors. In addition to daily patterns of behavior, the flies’ behavior changed across days as they weakened and died

. This dataset is also the first to continuously capture high dimensional, high-resolution behavioral data across a diurnal cycle, allowing us to investigate how changes in internal state related to time of day affect behavior. By recording when flies feed ( as measured by proboscis extension ), this data may also provide new insights into the effects of hunger and satiety. We provide both high-resolution recordings and our postural tracking output to facilitate further data analysis

. With our combination of postural tracking and unsupervised behavioral classification we are able to specify behaviors at a higher level of granularity, such as different grooming modalities and locomotion states. Our ability to distinguish these fine-grained behaviors allows us to see changes in specific grooming modalities with time of day, and track how flies gradually lose their ability to walk normally with age and stress

. The resulting ethograms permit analysis of patterns in locomotion, proboscis extension, and grooming ( Fig 1D ). Because our data is continuous over multiple 24-h periods, we can look at how behavior varies with time of day and across days of the experiment. Our data is closed ( i. e. the fraction of time spent in all behaviors must add up to one ) requiring us to use methods of compositional data analysis to examine changes across flies, hours, and days [20, 24]

. The first hour after the lights turn on is particularly distinct from all other hours, with higher levels of locomotion and grooming. The locomotion and grooming behavior components increase in the hours leading up to lights on and lights off, indicating the anticipation of the change in lighting condition characteristic of circadian rhythms. Over the course of the experiment, the flies’ behaviors start changing significantly after Day 3 ( Fig 1F )

. Previous work has found an elevation of ‘micromovements’ during day-time hours [17]. These movements would not be detectable in most activity-count based systems and would be classified as ‘idle’, but in our experiment are quantified as grooming, proboscis extension, and very short bouts of locomotion including single steps. The flies exhibit peaks of activity around lights on and lights off, although the morning peak is much more prominent than the evening peak

. Even before enclosing, D. melanogaster exhibit daily patterns of certain behaviors, such as larval negative phototaxis [34] and eclosion [35], so it is unsurprising that even 2–3 day old adults already have a strong diurnal pattern. The geometric means of behavior components across all flies versus ZT for Day 1 show the expected pattern of increased idle during the night and increased locomotion during the day ( Fig 3A )

. Because our behavior classifications occur at a higher time-resolution and are based on limb tracking, we are able to observe the pattern of ‘true grooming’, separate from small fidgets and steps. D. melanogaster’s typical morning and evening peaks of activity are regulated by different populations of neurons [7, 36]. Certain life stage- or context- dependent behaviors such as eclosion [35] and egg-laying [37] occur in the morning and evening, respectively

. Overall, we find that our data captures both expected and novel patterns of D. melanogaster behavior across multiple 24-h periods. Our findings, particularly with regards to the ethological distinction between the morning and evening, offer a new window into the hourly and daily patterns of D. melanogaster activity, and represent a significant step forward in our ability to quantify the inherently multi-timescale structure of animal behavior.

. Our data recapitulates many previously described trends in D. melanogaster diurnal and aging/dying patterns of behavior, while also finding novel features of the daily and lifelong behavior trends. The method of behavior capture presented here improves on previous efforts to quantify D. melanogaster behaviors over long timescales

. We have found that the morning and evening activity peaks are also ethologically distinct in the set of spontaneous behaviors that occur throughout the entire D. melanogaster lifespan. In particular, D. melanogaster spend the hour after dawn in a high locomotion and grooming state that is not seen in the dusk hours

. In particular, we find that hind and wing grooming make up a significant portion of day-time grooming behaviors, but are almost eliminated during dark hours, suggesting that these grooming modalities may serve a different purpose and/or be under different circadian regulation than fore grooming, which occurs at comparatively larger levels during the day and night hours. The flies in our experiment lack the strong ‘siesta’ ( low activity levels midday ) that other work has found

. These studies are able to provide longitudinal behavioral data, but are limited in their ability to identify discrete behavioral states, generally adding an additional non-locomotion/non-idle state which is labeled as “grooming” or “micromovement”. Here, we are able to distinguish between these states using postural tracking and unsupervised machine learning. Our results show that D. melanaster exhibit distinct patterns of locomotion, probis extension, and grooming across the 24-h cycle, and that these patterns change over the course of the experiment

The study of animal behavior across timescales, from hours to lifespans requires a model organism with a variety of behaviors and a short lifespan to capture the breadth of the times it might inhabit. Dophila melanogaster have a set of behaviors, many of which are spontaneous and occur in simple environments. Previous studies of the D melanog diurnal cycle have used coarse metrics, such as activity counts by Dila Activity Monitors [9]. These have shown that melan have peaks locom activity around subjective morning and evening, with increase in activity anticipating change in lighting [5, 6]. We recorded freely moving D melan using constant illumination and IR-sensitive camera at frame rate 100, with 12 visible-light cycle. tracked 14 parts each using SLE [19] and MotionMapper [11] unsupervised method to develop data-driven definitions stereot behavioral, such as grooming, locom, probis extension

We leveraged high-resolution data to carry in-depth analysis of daily pattern melan behavior, focusing first day experiment when diurnal was strongest ( Fig 2 ) Flies reared from embryos to day adults same lightark time as experiments. Even before, flies age and die experiment probis extension length, perhaps age or stress attenuation sleep.

The final answer is: 

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster across multiple timescales, from seconds to days, using high-resolution recordings and postural tracking. The results show distinct patterns in stereotyped behaviors, such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion, across the 24-hour cycle, and changes in these patterns over the course of the experiment.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored. Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-biased genetic screen, we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To better understand the functions of PTPN-22, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development. Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline, as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions. 

    Supporting Text:
    In this study we identified PTPN-22, a conserved tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type, as an effector of C. elegans molting. Specifically, loss of PTPN-22 catalytic activity alleviated molting defects in nekl mutant backgrounds with partial-to-moderate loss of function. An appealing model is that the NEKLs and PTPN-22 may exert opposing effects on one or more common substrates or may act on distinct components within a discrete complex or pathway

. Together these findings implicate PTPN22 in cell adhesion, although analogous functions for PTPN22 beyond the immune system remain largely unexplored. As described below, we identified the C. elegans ortholog of PTPN22 in a genetic screen for genes that affect the C. elegans molting process. Molting is an essential developmental process in nematodes and other members of the ecdysozoan group, allowing for organismal growth and adaptation to new environments [34]

. elegans PTPN-22 might functionally interact with NEKL proteins in the context of molting. We therefore took a non-biased approach to identify potential partners and targets of C. elegans PTPN-22 by mapping its in vivo ( proximate ) interactome using biotin-based proximity labeling methods

. We observed that ptpn-22 ( C306S ) suppressed nekl-2; nekl-3 molting defects by ~50% ( Fig 1B ), indicating that it is the loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity that leads to the suppression of nekl-2; nekl-3 molting defects. Although mammalian members of the PTPN22 family have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system, those findings did not suggest an obvious mechanism by which C

. Notably, among the 237 protein phosphatases in C. elegans, 94 are presumed to be PTPs and over 50% of C. elegans phosphatases have human orthologs [10, 11]. Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type ( PTPN ) is a subset of the PTP family comprising 17 protein tyrosine phosphatases in humans

. Taken together, our genetic and localization data suggest that PTPN-22 plays a positive role in the function of C. elegans hemidesmosomes. Nevertheless, we failed to detect gross changes in the localization pattern of CeHD components ( MUP-4, IFB-1A, and LET-805 ) in ptpn-22 null mutants ( S6A Fig ), consistent with the viability and normal morphology of ptpn-22 mutants. As such, PTPN-22 could play a role in fine-tuning CeHD function, assembly, or stability

. Collectively, our data indicate that loss of ptpn-22 can suppress weak and some moderate loss-of-function nekl mutations but not strong loss-of-function mutations, a profile exhibited by several other previously described nekl suppressors [40, 43, 44]. Human PTPN22 is an 807-amino-acid ( aa ) protein containing a tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain at the N terminus followed by an interdomain and several C-terminal proline-rich motifs ( P1–P4 ) ( Fig 1D ) [45]

. Our results suggested a significant increase in the percentage of suppressed nekl-2; nekl-3 worms when both PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 were inhibited as compared with the loss of single proteins including putative null mutations ( S4C Fig ). Overall, our genetic results suggest that PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 are unlikely to be fully dependent on each other for their activities and also suggest that PTPN-22 may affect molting through one or more additional targets

. Ongoing research continues to uncover the precise mechanisms by which NEKLs and MLTs affect the molting process in C. elegans. Most notably, we have shown that NEKLs and their human counterparts regulate several aspects of membrane trafficking [39, 40]

. Our findings from proximity labeling, molecular modeling, and subcellular localization studies, in conjunction with previously published yeast two-hybrid interaction data, suggest that PTPN-22 may be an accessory component or regulator of this complex [66]. Such a model is consistent with our current and previously published genetic data showing that inhibition of PTPN-22, DNBP-1, CDC-42, and SID-3/ TNK2/ACK1 can suppress nekl molting defects

. Collectively, our proximity labeling studies provide a foundation for uncovering previously unknown molecular and cellular functions and partners of the PTPN-22 family of proteins within the context of an intact developing organism. Given that we identified ptpn-22 as a suppressor of nekl molting defects, we were interested in identifying proteins that could functionally connect PTPN-22 to the NEKL–MLT pathway

. Given that CeHDs are extensively remodeled during molting cycles, we were curious if loss of ptpn-22 might contribute to nekl molting suppression in part through its effects on CeHDs in addition to its implicated interactions with DNBP-1. As a test for this, we carried out partial RNAi knockdown of the hemidesmosome proteins mup-4 and let-805 in nekl-2; nekl-3 worms but failed to observe any mitigation of the molting-defective phenotype ( S6B Fig )

. 3-fold ) ( Figs 5A and S7A and S4 File ) [78, 89]. To explore a potential role for C. elegans PTPN-22 in integrin function and other adherens junctions beyond CeHDs, we conducted RNAi enhancement tests to assess ptpn-22 genetic interactions with pat-2 and dlg-1. ptpn-22 ( S33Stop ) worms had significantly higher paralysis rates when subjected to various dilutions of pat-2 ( RNAi ) feeding treatment as compared with wild-type worms ( Fig 5B and 5C )

. In this study, we identified mutations affecting PTPN-22, which we showed binds to the Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) DNBP-1, loss of which also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects

. Along those lines, we previously identified a mutation affecting PAA-1/PPP2R1, a conserved serine/threonine PP2A phosphatase subunit, as a suppressor of nekl defects [41]. Nevertheless, whereas PP2A could directly reverse NEKL-mediated phosphorylation at serines and threonines, PTPN-22 is predicted to target specifically phosphotyrosines and may thus oppose NEKL functions more indirectly

. As compared to its human ortholog, C. elegans PTPN-22 is relatively small ( 469 aa ) and contains a single proline-rich region near its N terminus, followed by the catalytic domain and two additional proline-rich regions in its C terminus ( Fig 1D ). Sequence alignment between PTPN-22 and orthologs in other organisms indicates conservation primarily within the catalytic domain ( S1 Fig ) ; PTPN-22 is 38% identical to human PTPN22 and 59% similar in this region

We previously showed that nekl-2 and ne-3 act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation [39, 40] and that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-function mutations in nekl-2 and ne-3 ( Fig 1B ), suggesting that PTP-22 may interact with NEs at this interface.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Current malaria elimination targets must withstand a colossal challenge–resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug, namely artemisinin derivatives. If artemisinin resistance significantly expands to Africa or India, cases and malaria-related deaths are set to increase substantially. Spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia is therefore critical for health organisations to prioritise malaria control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse. We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance. Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022. Moreover, the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region. Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone, thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution. By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level, this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia.

   . We develop a geostatistical model of the presence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance, in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, calibrated to the most comprehensive dataset available from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ). The spatio-temporal maps of K13 marker prevalence presented in this paper will be able to support monitoring of drug resistance in Southeast Asia, appropriate targeting of preventive strategies and malaria elimination efforts.

. No such fine-scale predictive maps exist for artemisinin resistance within Southeast Asia. However, to generate predictive maps using appropriate model-based geostatistics, large numbers of unique spatio-temporal locations are needed [6]. This is impossible to achieve with clinical measures of resistance; the data are simply not available owing to the expensive and time-consuming nature of clinical studies [4, 7]. A way forward is to use molecular markers associated with resistance

. Since the identification of K13 markers, many studies have been conducted ( and historical blood samples reanalysed ) so that now a significant amount of data exists on the prevalence of these markers. In this paper, data-driven, predictive spatio-temporal maps are presented for the first time of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives across the Greater Mekong Subregion

This paper has provided the first data-driven, predictive maps of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion. These maps provide estimates of drug resistance for locations where no data are available and can be used by health agencies to guide the prioritisation of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance

. In 2015, Tun et al. quantified the spread of K13 propeller mutations with a similar Bayesian model–based geostatistics framework [15]; however, predictions were only for Myanmar in 2014 and based on the limited amount of available data at the time. The results presented in our paper are consistent with this earlier modelling work as well as the underlying data collected to assess the spread of artemisinin resistance ( e. g. [4, 5] )

. Genetic mutations known to be associated with drug resistance can be used to monitor spatio-temporal trends in antimalarial drug resistance as a proxy of clinical efficacy. Genetic studies are easier to conduct and are a fraction of the cost of clinical studies, thereby allowing larger numbers of samples to be collected across more spatio-temporal locations [7]. Data from genetic studies are readily amenable to model-based geostatistics. In a previous study, Flegg et al

. If artemisinin resistance becomes established in Africa, it will likely facilitate the emergence and spread of ACT partner drug resistance, jeopardising the efficacy of ACTs, which will lead to an increase in malaria cases and, ultimately, an increase in malaria-attributable deaths. The maps presented in this paper provide predicted artemisinin resistance levels in places and at times for which no data are available

In a previous study, Flegg et al. developed a predictive model for the geographical and temporal trends across Africa of the prevalence of mutations in the dhps gene of the parasite that are known to be associated with SP resistance [8]. A continuous predictive surface in space and time was inferred for dhps markers using Bayesian model–based geostatistics over the spatial domain of sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2010

. The maps and model output can be used to help inform recommendations for appropriate drug choices at the local and regional levels. Furthermore, the success of existing resistance containment strategies can be assessed using the model by considering the predictions of the changing extent of resistance. The maps and model outputs are available to share with regional national malaria control programs to facilitate spatial decision support, including country and provincial level predictions

. This paper has confirmed the spatio-temporal patterns of drug resistance to artemisinin derivatives in Southeast Asia, where malaria elimination by 2030 is being actively targeted. The current elimination targets need to withstand the challenge of resistance to the current gold standard group of antimalarial drugs, artemisinin derivatives, that first emerged in Cambodia. Such resistance has now been detected in the Greater Mekong Subregion [4, 5]

. P. falciparum infections with significantly slowed parasite clearance under artemisinin-based therapies have now been detected in neighbouring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion; namely in Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar [4, 5]. Spatial information on changes to antimalarial resistance is critical for health organisations to prioritise control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse

. We note that we could exclude regions based on other measures of malaria transmission that are more likely to reflect disease burden in the region accurately; however, parasite rate is the only metric publicly available at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale. In locations where resistance is predicted to be established in 2000 already ( e. g

. g. [4, 5] ). The identification of mutations in the K13 protein that are associated with artemisinin resistance in 2014 provided a means for monitoring artemisinin resistance on a large geographical scale. Almost 200 different candidate mutant genotypes were first established [11, 12]; meanwhile, a study from WWARN has since identified a refined set of K13 mutant alleles associated with slow parasite clearance–the clinical hallmark of artemisinin resistance [12]

. The work presented in this paper significantly advances earlier work by providing predictions of K13 prevalence over the entire Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022 based on a comprehensive dataset of K13 studies conducted in the region. It illustrates the expansion of artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion in the last 10 years and the increase of prevalence in east and north Myanmar, bordering Indian States. In 2015, Tun et al

We use data publicly available through WWARN’s comprehensive artemisinin molecular surveyor [13], which collates the prevalence of molecular markers in the propeller region of the K13 gene of the malaria parasite. All non-synonymous mutations at any K13 locus > 440 ( i. e., within the propeller region ) are captured along with a date of sample collection and geospatial information. In some studies, a non-synonymous mutation in locus 252, outside the propeller domain, was captured

. However, these factors each have an important mechanistic role to play in the rate of change of artemisinin resistance, which could be modelled by considering another hierarchical layer in the statistical model that relates the level of resistance to, for example, the incidence of Pf malaria during a time interval. There are several limitations to the work presented here

. Of extreme concern is that there are signs of emergence in Africa [18–20]. The consequences of artemisinin resistance may be dire: historically, the emergence and spread of parasites resistant to the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and later SP resulted in dramatic increases in malaria-related morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa [1]

. We have characterised the changes in artemisinin resistance in terms of the prevalence of the K13 markers. Moreover, we have incorporated several key factors ( transmission, human population, temperature suitability and accessibility ) as covariates in the mean of the Gaussian process

. We downloaded data from WWARN’s Artemisinin Molecular Surveyor on 7 June 2023. In this work, we model the overall prevalence of any K13 mutation that has been associated with delayed parasite clearance [12]. That is, a sample is classified as ‘positive’ if it has a mutation at any K13 locus listed in Table 1 and classified as ‘negative’ otherwise. For a given study, the prevalence of K13 mutations is then defined as the proportion of positive K13 samples out of those tested

. The analysis showed that SP should be considered compromised, and countries should switch to alternative strategies if the dhps-A581G marker is prevalent at more than 30%. In 2014, mutations in the propeller region of the K13 protein that are associated with slow parasite clearance response to artemisinins were identified and almost 200 different candidate mutant genotypes were established [11, 12]. The K13 propeller region is the target of artemisinin binding and mutations in this region are associated with artem resistance [12,13]. The propeller region of the K protein is the target of artemisinin and mutations in this region are associated with artem resistance [12,13 ] The propeller of the K protein is the target artem and mutations in this region are associated with artem resistance [12,13 ] The propeller of the K protein the target artem and in this region are associated with artem resistance [12,13 ] The propeller of K the protein the artem and in region are associated with artem [12,13 ] The propeller K the protein artem in region are associated with artem [12,13 ] The propeller the artem in region are associated artem [12,13 ] The artem in region are associated artem [12,13 ] artem are associated artem [12 ] artem artem ar [12 ] ar ar ar [12 ] ar ar [ ] ar ] ar ] ar ] ar ] ar ] ar ] ] ar ] ar ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]

    Title: 
    Abstract: Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, critical for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides, which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. However, the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes, while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction. In addition, we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex, DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complex; however, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of hNLRP1. Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8, it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.

   . These results demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 exist in a steady state characterized by the formation of NT-CT and FL-CT autoinhibitory complexes, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism among these FIIND-containing proteins. Previous structural studies have shown that the host protease DPP9 forms a ternary complex with FIINDFL and UPA of hNLRP1, rNLRP1, and CARD8, effectively preventing UPA-mediated oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome activation [22–24]

The formation of distinct autoinhibitory complexes involving FIIND-containing proteins, such as NLRP1 and CARD8, represents a highly regulated mechanism in controlling inflammasome activation. Our findings demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes, including NT-CT and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct molecular mechanisms. Both the NT and FL proteins bind to CT and restrict CT’s activity for inflammasome assembly and activation

. Both NLRP1 paralogs and the CARD8 inflammasome can be activated by pathogenic proteases through a mechanism termed “functional degradation”, whereby these proteases cleave the NT, leading to the degradation of both NT and FL, thus liberating CT for inflammasome assembly [9–12, 17, 19]. Consequently, these viral or bacterial proteases can activate both NT-CT and FL-CT autoinhibitory complexes

NLRP1 and CARD8 are the sole mammalian proteins containing FIIND domain and they exist in three forms at steady state: full-length protein ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal peptide ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal peptide ( CT ). This diversity arises due to autoproteolysis occurring between ZU5 and UPA subdomains within FIIND ( Fig 1A–1C )

. It is believed that mNLRP1bNT interacts with mNLRP1bCT to silence the inflammasome activity [8–11]; however, the specifics of this interaction have not been clear demonstrated. Here, we utilized biochemistry approaches to characterize the autoinhibitory complexes of CARD8 and rodent NLRP1 variants, including mNLRP1b and rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ), revealing that all of these proteins form both NT-CT and FL-CT complexes. albeit through distinct mechanisms.

. Consequently, we investigated whether other NLRP1 paralogs, such as mNLRP1b and rNLRP1, as well as CARD8, are capable of forming similar autoinhibitory complexes. In alignment with hNLRP1, co-immunoprecipitation assay conducted in HEK293T cells demonstrated that N-terminal Flag-tagged mNLRP1bNT, rNLRP1NT, and CARD8NT can interact with their corresponding C-terminal HA-tagged CT counterparts ( Fig 1D–1F )

. Among the canonical inflammasome pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ), both NLRP1 and CARD8 contain a unique function-to-find domain ( FIIND ), which undergoes autoproteolysis to yield two noncovalently associated polypeptides: the N terminus ( NT ) and the C terminus ( CT ) [7]. Human NLRP1 ( hNLRP1 ) is structured with an N-terminal PYD, followed by the NACHT domain, LRR, FIIND, and a C-terminal CARD

. However, these studies primarily focused on the FIIND domain or utilized proteins with significant deletions of their N-terminal domains [22–24]. As a result, it remains unclear whether other regions of NLRP1 or CARD8 contribute to DPP9 interaction or to the formation of autoinhibitory complex

. Cellular DPP9 has been identified as a critical checkpoint for both NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes through the formation of similar complexes ( FL-DPP9-CT ), dependent on autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain. Indeed, DPP9 binds only to full-length hNLRP1 but not its NTs or CTs; mutations at the cleavage sites of hNLRP1 ( S1213A ) eliminate their interactions with DPP9

. The FIIND domain of FL proteins forms a relatively conserved ternary complex with the cleaved CT and the cellular protease DPP9 [22–24], while NT utilizes different domains or regions to interact with and inhibit CT ( S4F Fig ). Specifically, hNLRP1NT employs its Linker1 region ( between PYD and NACHT domains ) to bind to hNLRP1CT [8], whereas mNLRP1bNT utilizes Linker3 ( between LRR and FIIND ) to interact with mNLRP1bCT

. In addition to the NT-CT interaction, cleavage-resistant mutants—mNLRP1bS984A, rNLRP1S969A, and CARD8S297A also interacted with their corresponding CT, consistent with previous reported interactions ( Fig 1G–1I ). These findings suggest that the formation of these two different complexes is a common feature shared by both CARD8 and NLRP1 paralogs. Next, we assessed whether these complexes influenced the activation of the NLRP1 or CARD8 inflammasome

. In conclusion, our research elucidates that the formation of NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes in FIIND-containing proteins constitutes a sophisticated mechanism of regulation, presenting potential avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated inflammasome activation. Further investigation into the structure-function relationships within these complexes will enhance the understanding of their biological significance and therapeutic potential.

. These results demonstrate that LF can activate rNLRP1 by disrupting the rNLRP1NT-rNLRP1CT complex. Aside from NLRP1, CARD8 is the only other protein containing FIIND domain that undergoes post-translational autoproteolysis. While CARD8 and NLRP1 share similar C-terminal regions, CARD8 lacks a structured N-terminal region, possessing only a 160-aa N-terminal unstructured region ( UR )

. hNLRP1 forms two distinct autoinhibitory complexes in which both hNLRP1FL and hNLRP1NT interact with hNLRP1CT, effectively preventing the assembly of the inflammasome mediated by hNLRP1CT [8]. The Linker1 region, located between PYD and NACHT of hNLRP1, is critical for forming these autoinhibitory complexes [8]; however, this region is not conserved in NLRP1 paralogs or CARD8

. In addition, the NT peptides of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, or CARD8 also interacted with DPP9, whereas their CT peptides did not bind ( Fig 2A–2C ). Interestingly, a prior study indicated that DPP9 can also bind to the ZU5 subdomain of rNLRP1 independent of the FIIND-DPP9-UPA complex, suggesting a wider range of interactions [24]. Indeed, the ZU5 subdomain of rNLRP1, mNLRP1b, and CARD8 interacted with DPP ( Fig 2D–F ), forming NT-DPP-CT complex. However, D9 did not bind to NT of hLR1 ( Fig 2G ), indicating specificity of the interaction

Our results demonstrate that NLR1 paral and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions but distinct mechanisms. The Link3 region between LRR and FI in mLR1 plays an essential role in forming NT-CT autohibitory complexes, while Z5 of rLR1 and CARD mediate NT-CT interaction. In addition, we explored the involvement of the protease D9 in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and significance of domain. Besides FL-D9-CT, D9 interacts with NT of mLR1, r1 and CARD through Z5, forming NT-D9-CT; however, D9 cannot bind NT of hLR1. Functional assay indicated that D9 is involved in NT-CT of rodent LR1 and CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. Our study enhanced understanding of the functions of FI-containing in inflamome autohibition and underscored the complexity of interactions within immune response.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and, consequently, overall tissue health. In various growing tissues, cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised, often referred to as ‘loser’, cells by the healthier neighbors. The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth, albeit under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. In summary, these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival.

    In this study, we present compelling evidence supporting the role of Rer1 as a regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila. We show that Rer1 is localized to the ER and cis-Golgi compartments and loss of Rer1 activates PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicating the onset of proteotoxic stress in the ER. These observations are consistent with the proposed function of Rer1 as a regulator of ER proteostasis [73]

. Here, we investigated the role of Retention in Endoplasmic Reticulum-1 ( Rer1 ) protein in the competitive cell proliferation in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Mutations in the rer1 gene were first described in yeast, where it was identified in a screen as a factor required for proper transport of Sec12p between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi [36]

. Furthermore, we found that loss of Rer1 creates proteotoxic stress in the developing wing epithelium, and when surrounded by wild-type cells, the clonal population of rer1 mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated specifically via the process of cell competition. We have also analyzed the role of Rer1 in Myc-induced overgrowth and Rer1 levels were found to be upregulated upon Myc-overexpression

. However, its localization and function in Drosophila remains unknown. Utilizing the GFP-rer1 genomic rescue construct, we observed that GFP-Rer1 colocalized with both ER ( Calnx ) and Golgi ( Golgin-245 ) markers in the wing epithelial cells ( S4A–S4B Fig ), affirming its conserved localization. Next, we wondered if the loss of Rer1 also affected protein homeostasis in flies

. Moreover, studies in yeast, worms and mouse cerebral cortex have shown that absence of Rer1 induces ER stress and activates the UPR pathways [43, 74], suggesting a well-conserved function of Rer1 across species. Our results show that proteotoxic stress induced by Rer1 deficiency creates loser cells that are eliminated via cell competition

. While the reduction in translation is probably not sufficient to induce cell competition [17], it may pose a disadvantage to the RpS3+/–cells when competing with the rer1–/–cells. In any case, aligned with other studies, our work shows that proteotoxic stress, even without a reduction in protein translation, is sufficient to drive elimination of the loser rer1–/–cells. Stress-mediated activation of UPR is associated with both proapoptotic and cytoprotective responses [76, 77]

. This is in line with recent studies that have implicated mutations in genes, for example, RNA Helicase Hel25E, E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahjong and Rp mutations, in causing proteotoxic stress and subsequent elimination of mutant cells via cell competition [11, 12, 15, 16, 49, 56]. Interestingly, our results show that despite both rer1–/–and RpS3+/–cells exhibiting increased p-eIF2α, rer1 mutant cells outperform RpS3+/–cells when juxtaposed

. Thus, the boundary cell death in rer1–/–clones observed in otherwise normal background is due to higher fitness of the surrounding wild-type cells. Altogether, these results show that the loss of Rer1 created loser cells which are eliminated via cell competition. Studies have shown that Rer1 is localized dynamically between the ER and cis-Golgi compartments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [52, 53] and mammalian cells [40, 44], where it functions in protein quality control processes [45]

. Thus, we analyzed the level of phosphorylated eIF2α ( p-eIF2α ), which is a well-established marker of proteotoxic stress [54]. Consistent with the proposed function of Rer1 [43], higher levels of p-eIF2α were observed in both rer1–/–clones ( Fig 3A–3C ) and RNAi-mediated depletion of Rer1 ( S5A–S5F Fig ) compared to the control regions, indicating activation of the UPR pathways. The increased level of p-eIF2α in rer1–/–clones was restored upon the expression of GFP-rer1 ( Fig 3D–3F )

. Four kinases, namely, PERK, GCN2 ( general control nonderepressible 2 ), PKR ( protein kinase R ) and HRI ( heme regulated inhibitor ) are known to sense cellular stress and cause phosphorylation of eIF2α, however, in Drosophila only PERK and GCN2 are conserved [58]. Studies suggest that phosphorylation of eIF2α via PERK is due to ER stress [59, 60], whereas the phosphorylation via GCN2 is due to amino acid starvation [61, 62]

. Moreover, p-eIF2α levels remained high in rer1–/–cells expressing bskDN ( S10E–S10F Fig ), placing JNK activity either downstream or parallel to stress induction. Altogether, these results suggest that activation of JNK signaling contributes towards the maladaptive effects of p-eIF2α in rer1–/–cells, restricting their growth. Our observation that the loser status of rer1 mutant cells is due to the proteotoxic stress aligns with similar findings in Rp mutants [11–16, 56]

. Despite the fact that Rer1 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, its function in the development of organisms remains largely unknown [43–45]. By creating a rer1 loss-of-function mutant, we show that rer1 is an essential gene in Drosophila

. We propose that this is due to the involvement of Rer1 itself in the cytoprotective processes. This was evident in our analysis of Rer1 in the regulation of proteostasis in Myc overexpressing cells and Myc-driven overgrowth. Myc-overexpression leads to PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α [30] and the induction of autophagy, which is required for the Myc-driven overgrowth [33]

. More importantly, we found that loss of Rer1 is sufficient to suppress Myc-induced overgrowth. In summary, our results demonstrate that Rer1 is an essential protein for proper maintenance of protein homeostasis and competitive cell survival in a developing tissue.

. Furthermore, p-eIF2α levels were strongly increased in Myc expressing rer1–/–cell, as compared to either rer1–/–or Myc-overexpression alone ( Fig 8A’–8D’ and 8A”’–8D”’; quantified in Fig 8F ), indicating that the Rer1 alleviated proteotoxic stress in the Myc-overexpressing cell. However, these experiments did not rule out the possibility of an independent additive effect of Myc-overexpression and loss of Rer1 on p-eIF2α levels and clonal growth

. Several potential reasons for the difference in their fitness can be envisaged. First, RpS3+/–cells, that are also rer1+/–, may experience higher stress levels than rer1–/–cells, potentially rescuing later from their loser fate. Second, different downstream pathways may be activated by stress originating in the cytoplasm of RpS3+/–cells as compared to stress in the ER of Rer1-deficient cells

. However, recent studies have shown that Rp+/- cells exhibit high proteotoxic stress [11–14] and activate the expression of bZip transcription factor Xrp-1, which plays an essential role in the elimination of the Rp+/- cells [11, 15, 16]. Interestingly, Xrp-1 appears to be responsible for the manifestation of various defects in Rp+/- cells, including reduced global translation and proteotoxic stress, contributing to the loser status [17]

. We observed that the expression of dominant-negative Basket ( bskDN ), the Drosophila ortholog of JNK, in rer1/–clones did not rescue the loser status (10–10 Fig ), suggesting that JNK activity is not required for the maladaptive effects of p-e2 in rer1/–cells. However, this does not rule out the possibility that JNK is activated in response to stress in rer1/–cells and contributes to their maladaptive effects

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that R1 is a novel regulator of proteost in Dophila and its role in competitive survival. We show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eIFα and that R1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through competition. Moreover, we find that R1 levels are upregulated in My-overexpressing cells alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting My-driven overgrowth. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of R1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis and cell survival in a developing tissue.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3, 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2, however, have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ). One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity. Here we tested all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ). Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2, 417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. Combined, this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. 

    Supporting Text:
   . To carry out a DMS screen. we made a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants using error-prone PCR, screened the library en masse for rad53 complementation, then used next generation sequencing ( NGS ) to identify complementors in the selected yeast. This resulted in testing 4, 885 of the 4, 887 possible CHEK2 SNVs, including all but one of the 3, 913 possible codon changes ( stop, synonymous, or non-synonymous )

. Yeast rad53 complementation has been used as a method for protein function assessment on several other CHEK2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants. For example, the CHEK2 founder mutation, c. 1100delC was tested for complementation of yeast rad53 mutants and no complementation was observed [24]

. Several functional studies of CHEK2 variants have included an “intermediate” category purported to represent variant function that is intermediate between wild-type ( tolerated ) and complete loss of function ( damaging ). To see if our rad53 complementation score could be used to predict intermediate function, we looked at 443 variants that have been tested in another functional assay that includes an intermediate category

. Having established that the results from the rad53 complementation screen correlate well with known function or pathogenicity, we used the screen data to functionally classify the 3, 187 unique amino acids changes that result from non-synonymous SNVs. Here we refer to variants that appear to reduce CHK2 function in the yeast assay as ‘damaging’ and those that are functionally indistinguishable from wild type as ‘tolerated’

. Another method to assay the function of CHK2 variants is to test their ability to complement a yeast RAD53 loss-of-function mutant ( rad53 ). Human CHEK2 was cloned and first tested for its ability to complement yeast rad53 in a complementation growth assay in 1998 [1]. This study also demonstrated that the CHK2 kinase defective mutant, D347A, failed to complement rad53

. Over 2, 700 CHEK2 missense variants, however, have not been tested in a functional assay, including most of the VUS in the ClinVar database. To test the ability of all possible CHEK2 coding SNVs to complement a rad53 mutant, we conducted a version of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) [36, 37]

. The same study also showed that a CHEK2 missense variant leading to S428F within the kinase domain does not complement, while a missense variant leading to P85L in the SCD has wildtype-like activity. Additionally, rad53 complementation assays using the DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) have been performed to evaluate the functional impact of over 100 germline missense variants detected in familial breast cancer patients or selected from the ClinVar database [33–35]

. Roeb et al. [33] and Delimitsou et al. [34], assayed rad53 complementation in the presence of DNA damaging agents to test 26 and 119 CHEK2 missense SNVs, respectively, and functionally classified each as either damaging, tolerated, or intermediate. While these two assays were very similar to each other, the results agreed on only 7 of the 17 variants that were tested in common

. 42, stdev = 0. 84; p 3. 2x10-23 ), which mimicked the synonymous SNVs ( Fig 3 ). Using individual clones, we confirmed that variants ( p. Gln510stop ) and ( p. Arg519stop ) were indistinguishable from wild-type in rad53 complementation ( Fig 1 ). Combined, these results strongly suggest that premature termination beyond residue 500 does not adversely affect the ability of CHEK2 to complement rad53 ( discussed further below )

. These assays include complementation of yeast rad53 mutants either in the presence or absence of DNA damaging agents [24, 32–34], phosphorylation of various CHK2 substrates in vitro or in mammalian cells [23, 26, 29–31, 52, 53], DNA damage responses in cells [53, 54], and protein stability [30, 31]

. 1100delC, which leads to a protein truncation in the kinase domain, have a 2-3-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer [12–14]. This pathogenic variant has also been associated with increased risk for male breast cancer, gastric, testicular, prostate, and thyroid cancers [15–20]. Additional CHEK2 variants that impair protein function have been identified in the germline of individuals with cancer and are associated with the development of cancer [21–27]

. A second region within the kinase domain, from V408 to F427, had a preponderance ( 70% ) of damaging variants and low RCS ( ave. -2. 47 ), visible in Fig 5. Previous functional assays for 162 CHEK2 missense variants generated by SNVs were summarized in [51] ( S3 Table )

. 94 ( range -7. 30–5. 20 ). To begin to test the assertion that loss of CHEK2 function correlates with screen depletion, we constructed 30 variants and tested them individually for rad53 complementation. We found that the 9 variants that did not fully complement rad53 in individual assays were more depleted in the screen ( ave. RCS -3. 64, SD = 1. 12 ) than were the 11 variants that fully complemented rad53 in individual assays ( ave. RCS -0. 76, SD = 1. 10 ) ( Fig 1 )

. Functional analysis can provide supporting evidence for clinical classification of rare variants that otherwise could not be supported by population and family data [11, 28]. Several different functional assays have been used to test individual and small sets of CHK2 missense variants identified in patients, including tests of protein stability, kinase activity toward various substrates, and activation by DNA damaging agents [22, 23, 29–32]

. Another recent large study by Stolarova et al. [22], functionally characterized 427 CHEK2 VUS selected by the international ENIGMA ( Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles ) consortium for variants with an association to an increased risk of breast cancer

. All CHEK2 clones were verified by sequencing. For complementation of the rad53 deletion, we used yeast strain YGB272 ( MATa rad53::HIS3 pRAD53::URA3 ), which was derived from a MATa/MATα RAD53/rad53::HIS3 SML1/sml1-1 heterozygote ( W303 background ) transformed with pJA92 encoding RAD53 and URA3 [60] ( diploid and plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Elledge )

. For example, our assay measured the ability of CHK2 variants to promote growth in the absence of Rad53 and DNA damaging agents, while other assays in yeast measured the ability of CHK2 variants to overcome DNA damage in a strain that does not require Rad53 or CHK2 for growth. Thus, our screen may miss damaging variants in positions in CHK2 that are not required for rad53 growth complementation, but instead may be required for activity in response to DNA damaging agents

The fact that several known loss-of-function CHK2 variants are associated with increased cancer risk leads to the expectation that any CHK2 loss-of function variant would also contribute to cancer risk. This forms the rationale for determining the functional consequences of CHK2 variants, either experimentally with functional assays or computationally with VEPs

. It is also possible that differences may arise for variants that affect CHK2 activity toward one subset of its targets and not another. Furthermore, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to successfully assess human genetic variants it does have its limitations. Some ORF variants may impact transcript splicing, protein binding sites, thermostability, or other post-translational modifications that are not captured by yeast complementation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g., colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. 

    Supporting Text:
   . These lines of evidence have strongly suggest that TenA and SpxA1 form a previously uncharacterized type II toxin-antitoxin system, in which toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. To figure out the molecular mechanism behind the action of TenA in regulation of pneumococcal epigenetic and colony phases, we performed affinity pull-down assay with His-tagged TenA to identify potential protein ( s ) that acts as liaison between TenA and the hsdS inversions

. In this study, we have serendipitously discovered a new type II toxin-antitoxin system in S. pneumoniae, SpxA1-TenA system, which was not included in the previously predicted type II TA systems [19]. The tenA ( toxin ) and spxA1 ( antitoxin ) genes are co-transcribed as an operon. The balance of the SpxA1-TenA system is controlled at the transcriptional level by the variable length of the AT dinucleotide repeat ( AT-rich ) region upstream of the spxA1-tenA promoter

. In short, this spontaneous genetic variation in the expression of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system may represent a programmed mechanism of epigenetic adaptation in S. pneumoniae.

. At the epigenetic level, the pneumococcal strain with the hu promoter-driven tenA completely lost the 6-mA methylation of the DNA motif recognized by the HsdSA1-specific DNA methyltransferase, with more abundant methylation of HsdSA2- and HsdSA3-recognized sequences. The TenA-driven epigenomic overhaul dramatically alters various aspects of bacterial biology

. Second, our transcriptional analysis showed that spxA1 and tenA are co-transcribed as an operon, which is consistent with the operonic feature of the type II TA genes. Third, TenA exhibited a toxic effect on S. pneumoniae ( enhanced autolysis ) when overexpressed. This toxic activity agrees with the TenA-induced growth inhibition in E. coli. The relatively milder toxic effect of TenA in S. pneumoniae is consistent with the mild toxicity of other type II pneumococcal TA pairs

. The comX1-X2 mutant completely lost the 6-mA methylation of all HsdSA1-specific motif loci in the pneumococcal genome. These genetic and epigenetic features were consistent with the dramatic shift of the colony phenotype toward the T phase in these mutants. Mechanistically, our affinity pull-down experiments suggested that ComX links TenA with the hsdS inversions by repressing the expression of the psrA invertase gene

. Our previous studies have demonstrated that PsrA-catalyzed inversions of hsdS genes in the cod locus and the resultant genome methylation patterns or methylomes epigenetically determine pneumococcal colony phases ( Fig 2A ) [9–11]

. pneumoniae employs the sequence variation in the AT-rich region to generate phenotypic diversity in clonal populations through modulating the expression of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system. Taken together, we propose a working model of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system ( Fig 7F )

. It is noteworthy that our TenA affinity pulldown did not identify SpxA1. This might be due to excessive degradation of SpxA1 by an unknown protease under the excess of TenA. It is also possible that SpxA1 neutralizes the toxic activity of TenA without forming a typical toxin-antitoxin complex. The striking effect of TenA overexpression on pneumococcal colony phase has enabled us to find the functional linkage between TenA and the DNA configurations in the cod locus

. Excessive TenA profoundly affects pneumococcal biology in DNA methyltransferase hsdS gene configuration, genome methylation pattern and the resultant colony phase.

. To understand the biological importance of the 5’-ATAT-3’ insertion that boosts the expression of the type II toxin TenA ( Fig 1C ), we characterized the 209-bp upstream sequence of spxA1 from 33, 625 genome sequences of S. pneumoniae in the PubMLST database ( https://pubmlst. org ) ( S6 Table ) [42]

. These SMRT sequencing data further confirmed that TenA promotes the T colony phase formation through enriching the non-HsdSA1 methylome. Taken together, TenA triggers the PsrA-catalyzed IR1- and IR2-mediated hsdS inversions to non-hsdSA1 state and results in the T phase methylome, which finally generating a T-dominant colony phase. TenA is annotated as a hypothetical protein without any known biological function in the pneumococcal genomes [29–32]

. Pneumococcal phase variation in colony opacity is epigenetically determined by reversible DNA inversions in the three DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the Spn556II/SpnD39III type I restriction-modification ( R-M ) system or the colony opacity determinant ( cod ) locus [7–9]

. Database search suggested that TenA ( 92 amino acids ) and SpxA1 ( 133 residues ) constitute a new type II toxin-antitoxin system. TenA and SpxA1 share 59. 8% and 73. 7% amino acid sequence identities with the toxin GinC ( accession WP_002984497 ) and its antitoxin ( accession WP_010922362 ) of Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively ( S3A Fig ). These result suggest that TenA and SpxA1 represent an uncharacterized TA system

. Taken together, these data demonstrates that TenA promotes the formation of T colony phase by locking the cod locus in a T phase-defining genetic configuration. Because only the hsdSA1 allele encoding HsdSA1 MTase defines the O phase methylome [9, 28], the abovementioned changes of the tenA-overexpressed variants in hsdSA allele genotypes and colony phenotypes strongly suggested that TenA modulates pneumococcal methylome

. S. pneumoniae also possesses a homolog of SpxA1—SpxA2. The two proteins share 45. 9% amino acid sequence identity ( S3B Fig ). Turlan et al. show that SpxA1 and SpxA2 have a redundant function, as deletion of spxA2 is synthetically lethal in the absence of spxA1. However, these two proteins have their unique functions in regulation of competence genes ( for SpxA1 ) and cell growth ( for SpxA2 ) [25]. We determined whether SpxA2 impacts spxA1-tenA expression and hsdSA1 abundance

. The hsdS inversions generate six bacterial subpopulations, each of which carries a different hsdSA allele ( hsdSA1 to hsdSA6 ) [7, 9, 10]. Each of the six HsdSA subunits drives the N6-methyladenine ( 6-mA ) methylation of a unique sequence motif that is present in the pneumoccal genome [9, 28]. The methylation of the hSA motifs by HSA1, HSA2, and HSA3 is mutually exclusive [9, 28]. The methylation of the hSA motifs by HSA, HSA, and HSA is mutually exclusive [9, 28 ]. The methylation of the hSA by HSA and HSA is mutually exclusive [9, 28 ] The methylation of the hSA by HSA and HSA is mutually exclusive [ 9, 28 ] The methylation of theSA by HSA and HSA is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation ofSA by HSA and HSA is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation ofSA by HSA and H is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation of by HSA and HSA is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation by HSA and H is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation H and H is mutually [ 9, 28 ] The methylation H and H is mutually [ 9, 28 The methylation H and H is mutually 9, 28 ] The methylation and H is mutually 9, 28 The meth and H is mutually 9 , 28 The and H is mutually 9, 28 The and H is 9, 28 The H is 9, 28 The is 9, 28 is 9 28 28 9 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28

    Title: 
    Abstract: High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

   . Moreover, cPCA is asymmetric, identifying the most enriched dimensions in the first condition after subtracting out the second condition as background; it cannot treat the two experimental conditions equally. Here we propose a novel solution to these problems we call generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ). We first demonstrate the role the α hyperparameter plays in cPCA, then explain our strategy for eliminating it

Investigators in the biological sciences are increasingly collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze, with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell RNA sequencing. Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) and its many variants [1–5] are used widely to help simplify these datasets and facilitate analysis

Discovering low-dimensional patterns that differ between conditions in high-dimensional datasets is a crucial analysis in many research contexts. Here we present gcPCA, a method that achieves this by examining the covariance structure of the datasets to find dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions. This work builds on the pioneering insights in the development of cPCA [14] but solves cPCA’s key problem, the requirement for the hyperparameter α

. This addresses more subtle and detailed questions, such as which subsets of neurons exhibit increased temporal correlations in condition A than B, or which subsets of genes are more likely to be up- or downregulated together in individual cells in condition A than B. Mathematically, answering these questions corresponds to finding dimensions that account for more variance in A than in B ( S1A Fig ). Recently, contrastive PCA ( cPCA ) was proposed as a method to address this problem [14]

Our motivation for the following method stems from eliminating the necessity of the free parameter α in the contrastive PCA method. To accomplish this, we introduce a normalization factor to mitigate the bias toward high-variance dimensions. We will summarize the process of calculating the gcPCs using gcPCA v4. 0 as an example, but v2 and v3 are analogous. gcPCA v4. 0 has the following objective function, as shown in equation ( eq

. We tested whether gcPCA could extract hippocampal replay in template-free fashion by contrasting post-task activity ( condition A ) with pre-task activity ( condition B ) ( Fig 3B ). We then compared the results of gcPCA to a template derived from activity during the task. To make this template, we performed traditional PCA on neuronal activity during running on the track

. For our analysis, we only used neurons that had a minimum firing rate of 0. 01 spikes/s during the task. We binned the neural data using a bin size of 10 ms and smoothed using a rolling average with a Gaussian window of size 5 bins. The data was then z-scored and normalized by the norm before applying the contrastive methods. The task data was then projected on the contrastive dimensions for evaluation. The same normalized data was used for the PCA analysis

. However, in many cases, the goal is to compare data collected under two different experimental conditions, which we refer to here as datasets. Since PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques operate on only one dataset, they cannot take experimental conditions into account. The most common approach for comparing two high-dimensional datasets is linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) [12] or its multidimensional analog, partial least squares discriminant analysis [13]

. We have developed an open-source gcPCA toolbox with implementations in Python and MATLAB of several different variants of gcPCA. This toolbox is freely available at: https://github. com/SjulsonLab/generalized_contrastive_PCA. Here we will present the different variants of gcPCA and their use cases. To illustrate the utility of gcPCA with real-world datasets, we first use the Chicago Face Dataset [17], which contains faces with different facial expressions

. This reveals that although the only explicit hyperparameter for cPCA is α, the automatic α selection algorithm depends on k, the number of components requested, thus constituting a second de facto hyperparameter. Another key application of gcPCA is high-dimensional omics datasets, which often compare two conditions ( e. g. disease vs. healthy ) to identify a list of features ( e. g. genes ) that differ between conditions

. 2 for the next iteration. This process continues until k gcPCs are found, which can be the number of features in the dataset, the minimum rank of the conditions, or a number specified by the user. We developed an extension for sparse gcPCA by using a similar approach to sparse PCA [3] and sparse cPCA [15]. We will first review the sparse PCA framework, then explain how we adapt it for gcPCA. In the synthetic data, we generated two conditions with 1×105 samples and 100 dimensions

. We then describe an open source toolbox for Python and MATLAB implementing several versions of gcPCA with different objective functions that are either asymmetric or symmetric, orthogonal or non-orthogonal, or sparse or dense, tailored to suit the specific application at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in the analysis of diverse biological datasets.

. One limitation of this study is that we did not establish rigorous criteria for what constitutes "noisy and finitely-sampled" data likely to benefit from penalizing high-variance dimensions ( Fig 1 ), but almost all real-world biological datasets likely qualify to some degree. There may also be situations in which cPCA’s α could be a feature, rather than a bug, if the investigator has prior knowledge that the patterns of interest will lie in high- or low-variance dimensions

. The biological sciences are currently undergoing an explosion of technologies that produce high-dimensional datasets, including novel forms of microscopy and neuroimaging, high-speed video tracking, Neuropixels recordings, -omics approaches with single-cell resolution, and many others. In addition to the analyses of electrophysiological recordings or single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated here, gcPCA could be applied to any of these experimental modalities

. PCA examines the covariance structure of the data to find dimensions that account for more variance than chance; these constitute patterns that are overrepresented in the data, such as assemblies of neurons whose activity fluctuates up and down together across time in a neural recording [6–9], or networks of genes that are up- or down-regulated together across cells in a single-cell RNAseq dataset [10, 11]

. gcPCA accomplishes this by extracting axes of increased variance in unsupervised fashion ( S1C Fig ), not by clustering or classifying the faces in a supervised manner as with LDA ( S1B Fig ). A key application for gcPCA is neuronal recordings, which frequently contain activity from hundreds of individual neurons [22, 23]

. We first performed sparse PCA separately on each condition and plotted the cells from both conditions in both PCA spaces ( Fig 4A-4B ). Cells from different subjects tended to aggregate together, and this pattern was largely preserved in either PCA space. This is because T2D and control cells exhibited similar covariance structure, with the loadings on the top PCs highly correlated ( Fig 4D )

To explain the need for the hyperparameter α in cPCA and how we avoid it in gcPCA, we will describe the objective function of each method and show how they perform in generated synthetic data. For illustration purposes, we generated synthetic data for two experimental conditions containing two-dimensional manifolds on a background of high-variance shared dimensions

. Strikingly, projecting the same runs onto the top gcPCs yielded qualitatively similar results ( Fig 3D ), suggesting that gcPCA ( v4, see Methods ) is extracting replay of task-related activity. Using PCA on either the pre- or post-task activity failed to extract this structure ( Fig 3E ), indicating it can only be found by contrasting POST with PRE

. A well-studied neurophysiological phenomenon is hippocampal replay, in which hippocampal neurons encoding spatial trajectories traversed during a behavioral task "replay" the same activity patterns in post-task periods [24]. Note that spatial location is a continuous variable, so we are not expecting gcPCA or cPCA to find dimensions that cluster the activity into different groups, as with the facial expression in Fig 3B. Instead, we are looking for dimensions that account for more variance in post- than pre-activity, as shown in Fig 3C

We used gcPCA to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data from type II diabetes (T2) patients and healthy controls (C) to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the two conditions ( Fig 5 ). We compared the results of gcPCA to those from PCA and LDA ( Fig 5 ) and found that gc identified more differentially expressed genes than PCA and LDA. This is likely because gc captures the covariance between genes that are up or down-regulated together in T2 and C, while PCA and L focus on individual genes that are differentially expressed between the two conditions

In conclusion, gcPCA is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method for comparing high-dimensional datasets to gain insights into complex biological phenomena. We provide an open-source toolbox with implementations of gc in Python and MATLAB and demonstrate its utility in diverse biological datasets, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocal replay in neurophys recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing.

    Title: 
    Abstract: B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1, OCI-LY3 ), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring. 

    Supporting Text:
    In this work, we established a ( semi ) -quantitative signaling network of the BCR and tested it in different B cell lymphoma cell lines. We explored how a more quantitative understanding of signaling can be used to describe a conserved B cell receptor regulated signaling network, which can be used as a starting point to quantify cell-specific, individual networks

. This supports the view that our model reflects common elements of intracellular signaling of acute B-cell signaling. Additional phosphoproteomic analyses of selected interventions support key insights of this model. After establishing these quantitative network models, we found that the BL-2-derived network structure forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in cell lines from Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) with aberrant BCR signaling

. Despite the discovery of feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling we could not find a cellular dependency in the cell lines we studied. However, as we determined that those signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types it might be possible that insights of this study apply also to other B cell lymphomas

. Importantly, by extending the network, the modeling procedure discovered three novel connections that significantly improved the model fit: ( i ) a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, ( ii ) a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70 and ( iii ) a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK. After we have established a semi-quantitative network model of BCR signaling in BL-2 cells, we aimed to assess if the final network describes BCR signaling in a general way

We decided to generate the first model on the Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL-2 as this type of lymphoma is a role model for studying acute B cell signaling [21, 44]. In BL-2 cells an external stimulus ( α-IgM ) is able to activate the BCR and its downstream intracellular signaling [44, 45]. Stimulation-mediated intracellular signaling typically displays a strong transient response with different kinetics followed by short or longer lasting activation plateau interval

. Since none of these outlier links is inherent to both cell lines of DLBCL or Burkitt Lymphoma origin we are unable to assign those differences to adaptations to chronic B-cell receptor signaling. Looking for more subtle common changes between acute and chronic BCR signaling a stronger positive feedback from GSK3 and a stronger coefficient between mTOR and RPS6 for HBL-1 and OCI-LY3 is observed. This points to the fact that only subtle changes seem to occur

. In summary, the BL-2 model constitutes a generic network structure that can accurately describe signaling for both BL cell lines. This finding is important as it demonstrates the existence of a signaling network core for the activated BCR in BL cells. In addition, three hitherto undescribed links in BCR mediated intracellular signaling in BL cells were unveiled to disentangle upstream wiring including the yet not fully resolved receptor proximal signaling events ( Fig 1C )

. While the mechanism of the crosstalk remains unclear, the phosphoproteome does identify 19 candidate phosphosites that are p38-regulated but not known ERK targets which could be investigated in future studies. Having developed a semi-quantitative model for activated BCR signaling in BL cells we sought to investigate if a similar signaling network exists in cells with aberrant BCR signaling such as in ABC-like DLBCL

. Compelling evidence is provided that in different NHL subtypes aberrant BCR signaling activation is important [9, 13–19]. BCR signaling is often studied in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines [5, 6, 12, 20, 21]. While the EGFR-signaling network or the T cell receptor pathway have been quantitatively studied in many contexts, the BCR signaling and its oncogenic variations have so far only gained limited attention

. This demonstrates that the observed p38-ERK crosstalk is not only limited to BCR activation, but is an inherent mechanism in BL signaling. To further characterize the crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK and to investigate more general consequences on overall signaling, a systematic proteomic analysis was performed

. Furthermore, it indicates that the BCR signaling network structure developed from BL-2 data can be seen as the most representative BCR signaling structure for BL cells activated by a crosslink of the BCR ( Fig 1C ). Next, we compared the fitted coefficient ( path ) s of BL-2 cells and BL-41 cells using the BL-2-optimised network structure ( Fig 2E )

. Thus, the well-known RAF->MEK->ERK-|RAF regulatory loop also exists in BLs and DLBCLs, whereas the negative impact of BCR mediated p38 activation onto this loop is a newly discovered crosstalk found in three BL cell lines BL-2, BL-41 and CA-46 and one DLBCL cell line HBL-1. We propose that the identified negative crosstalk from BCR mediated activation of p38 to the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway might dampen an excessive RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade

. B cell receptor signaling represents a network for which the extend of feedback and crosstalk still remains unclear. Furthermore, a better dissection of chronic vs. acute signaling will support our understanding of related diseases. In normal B cells, the pathway is triggered by antigens, but is chronically activated in specific sets of Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma ( NHL )

. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that the more generic network trained from BL-2 and BL-41 cell lines had better transfer capacity to DLBCL cell lines HBL-1 and OCILY3 than the literature network indicating that a model trained on BCR-activated B-cells is informative to be transferred to BCR-driven cancer models

. Fig 1D presents the literature-derived starting network adjusted to the structure of the final BCR signaling network model for BL-2 cells with pruned links indicated in grey and novel links indicated in green ( see S2 Fig for model fit vs. data comparison ). Four of the removed links correspond to redundancies in the receptor proximal signaling structure around PI3K where removal resolved this non-identifiability

., 2015; Vanshylla et al., 2018 ) [5, 6]. This signal transduction network downstream of the B cell receptor ( BCR ) has received much attention, as it is a major regulator in adaptive immunity [7–10]. It has been shown that the relative activity of the multiple pathways downstream of BCR determines the outcome of BCR signaling [11]. The activity of the BCR is important for the expansion and survival and can be supported by both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms [12]

. The few existing BCR signaling models are mostly deterministic models that include BCR signal propagation by a specific set of network nodes [23, 24, 34, 35]. The models cover both membrane proximal, early signaling events and to some extend downstream signaling events. Furthermore, a detailed model of the feedback loops involving LYN and SYK incorporating every phosphorylation event for six proximal signaling components has been established [34]

. These so far undescribed network links include the strong negative crosstalk from p38 to RAF/MEK/ERK, which has been previously described in endothelial cells [48] or EGFR-activated epithelial cells [49]. For BCR activated signaling this feedback however was not yet described. Therefore, we decided to conduct further experiments to characterize the model-predicted p38-mediated dampening of MEK/ERK phosphorylation

. Thus, it is evident that the current best network structure found for BL-2 cells can be transferred to BL-41 and results in an equally good model fit as if using the individually fitted network structure from BL-41 data. This successful transfer strongly supports the view of the similarity of BCR signaling in both BL cell lines

. In addition, also JNK and p38MAPK are activated downstream of the BCR [4]. These pathways converge in the activation of a set of transcription factors that regulate B cell survival and proliferation [5, 6, 7, 8]. BCR signaling has been shown to be deregulated in B cell lymphomas [9, 10, 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,73,74,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,101,103,105,107,109,111,113,115,119,123,127,131,135,139,143,147,151,155,159,163,167,171,175,179,183,187,191,195,199,203,207,211,215,219,223,227,231,235,239,243,247,251,255,259,263,267,271,275,279,283,287,291,295,299,303,307,311,319,323,331,335,339,343,347,351,359,363,367,371,379,383,391,395,403,407,411,419,423,431,435,443,447,451,459,463,471,475,483,487,499,503,511,523,535,547,559,571,583,595,607,619,631,643,655,667,679,691,703,715,727,739,751,763,775,787,801,815,839,851,863,887,911,923,947,971,995,1019,1033,1055,107,109,111,113,117,121,125,129,131,135,139,143,147,151,155,159,163,167,171,175,179,183,187,191,195,199,203,207,211,215,219,223,227,231,235,239,243,247,251,255,259,263,267,271,275,279,283,287,291,295,303,307,311,319,323,331,335,339,343,347,351,359,363,367,371,379,383,391,395,403,407,411,419,423,431,435,443,447,451,459,463,471,475,483,487,499,503,511,523,535,547,559,571,583,595,607,619,631,643,655,667,679,691,703,715,727,739,751,763,775,787,801,815,839,851,863,887,911,923,947,971,995,101,103,105,109,111,113,117,121,125,129,131,135,139,143,147,151,155,159,163,167,171,175,179,183,187,191,195,199,203,207,211,215,219,223,227,231,235,239,243,247,251,255,259,263,267,271,275,279,283,

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

   . In this study, we combine experimental approaches and mathematical modelling to explore the molecular control of Notch1 receptor activity by the ligands, DLL4 and JAG1. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role for heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complexes, which could enable angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tips cells and trailing stalk cells.

. These data argue that a heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complex, formed when the ligands are expressed in the same cell, relieves Notch1 receptor cis inhibition and thereby enables efficient Notch1 receptor signalling. Overall, our experimental work raises the possibility that two factors could underlie the mechanism by which JAG1 antagonizes DLL4 to enable appropriate tip and stalk cell selection to drive angiogenic sprouting

. Consistent with the experimental findings, DLL4 homodimers, but DLL4-JAG1 heterodimers, mediate Notch1 receptor cis-inhibition. Since angiogenic sprouting involves a tightly regulated interplay between Notch signalling and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor ( VEGFR ) signalling, based upon our new experimental results, we further elaborated our DLL4/JAG1-Notch signalling model ( 1 ) and propose a new theoretical model of DLL4/JAG1-Notch-VEGF signalling

. In summary, we have presented a model of Notch signalling which incorporates the novel finding that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes, which could underlie the observed opposing effects of JAG1 and DLL4 in sprouting angiogenesis

. Significant advances in our understanding of Notch signalling have emerged, and continue to emerge, through use of powerful mathematical approaches coupled to in silico modelling of the biological consequences of the molecular and cellular processes involved in this pathway [14–16, 25–29, 39–43]. Several existing models have addressed the distinct roles of JAG1 and DLL4 in angiogenic patterning [33, 41]

. Collectively, these data demonstrate that our model recapitulates endothelial cell fate driven by the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, in sprouting angiogenesis, and underscore the importance of DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization and the different affinities for Notch1 of trans DLL4 and JAG1 in this process.

. In Figs 2–4, we have shown that the heterodimerization of DLL4 and JAG1 could be a central mechanism in the control of Notch1 signalling. Thus, these simulations suggest that the DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization could be critical for tip/stalk cell formation during sprouting angiogenesis within specified thresholds of Notch ligand expression

. In comparable assays of receptor transactivation and cis inhibition, JAG1/DLL4 heterodimers similarly controlled both Notch2 and Notch3 signalling activity ( see S9 Fig ). Since all Notch ligands share a common overall architecture, it could be of interest to investigate if other Notch ligands can form heteromeric complexes, and to decipher the possible biological consequences of these interactions

. In addition to the significant differences in the magnitude of Notch1 transactivation and cis inhibition elicited by each ligand ( Fig 2 ), we have uncovered the previously overlooked phenomenon of ligand heterodimerization ( Fig 3 ). Specifically, we show that a JAG1/DLL4 heteromeric complex blocks DLL4-dependent Notch receptor cis inhibition thereby allowing receptor transactivation, which is stimulated by ligands expressed by neighbouring cells

. Clearly, model ( 1 ), which incorporates DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization, but not a model lacking DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization, faithfully reproduced our experimental observations ( see Figs 2 and 3 ), which showed that JAG1 blocks DLL4-mediated Notch receptor cis-inhibition. Therefore, the model supports the view that DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization is necessary to enable the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on Notch receptor signalling ( see S4 and S5A–C Figs for additional simulations )

. To elucidate a possible molecular basis of this difference we assessed binding of the ligands to Notch receptors expressed at the cell surface. Fig 1C and 1D show that DLL4, but not JAG1, bound relatively efficiently to Notch1 ( Fig 1C ). In contrast to its lack of binding to Notch1, JAG1 efficiently associated with both Notch2 and Notch3 ( Fig 1D )

. In this study, we have used simple experimental approaches coupled to mathematical modelling to address this question, specifically by considering how the JAG1 and DLL4 ligands differentially control Notch1 receptor activation, a question of fundamental relevance in light of the well-established evidence for the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1, which together control angiogenic sprouting [18, 19]

. By integrating DLL4 and JAG1 dynamics, and DLL4/JAG1 dimerization, into our previous theoretical understanding of Notch signalling, a new mathematical model for tip endothelial cell selection in angiogenesis is proposed which successfully recapitulates the biological observations that JAG1 and DLL4 play distinct roles in angiogenesis

. To explore the potential biological implications of our biochemical findings presented above, we extended our earlier theoretical model of DLL4-Notch signalling [15] to produce a new model which takes account of the observed differences in affinity of the Notch1 receptor for ( trans ) DLL4 and ( trans ) JAG1, as well as heteromeric DLL4/JAG1 complex formation. In any given cell, the new model is presented mathematically as Eq

. The preceding analyses considered Notch1 signalling mechanisms controlled by DLL4-JAG1 heterodimer formation at the molecular and individual cell level. We next tested the validity of our model in the context of endothelial cell fate in sprouting angiogenesis

. We next tested if numerical simulations of the DLL4/JAG1-Notch signalling model ( 1 ) could recapitulate the observed opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on Notch1 signalling ( see Figs 2 and 3 ), and previously published data ( see Fig 6 in [18] ) similarly describing the different roles of DLL4 and JAG1 in the control of Notch1 signalling. We first considered the effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on Notch receptor cis-inhibition

. Collectively, our modelling results recapitulate the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on Notch1 signalling and highlights the importance of a novel mechanism whereby JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-mediated Notch cis-inhibition via DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization, which could induce a mutual inactivation of DLL4 and JAG1 in cells ( see S3 Fig ), coupled to the relatively higher affinity for Notch1 of trans DLL4 compared to trans JAG1

. Both receptors and ligands harbour multiple EGF-like repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions [20], and we here recently shown that homomeric DLL4 ligand complexes could promote cis inhibition of Notch receptor activity [15]. Moreover, the fact that all Notch ligands share a common overall architecture raises the possibility of a potential biological role for heteromeric ligand complex formation, up to now, a mechanism which has not been reported

. By comparison, JAG1 could not similarly induce strong ( cis ) inhibition of Notch1 signalling ( Fig 2A ), whereas the closely related JAG2 ligand, in common with DLL4, promoted strong cis inhibition of Notch1 activity. We have previously shown that DLL4-dependent cis inhibition of Notch activity requires ligand dimerization/oligomerization ( herein referred to simply as dimerization ) [15]. In this light, we compared DLL4, JAG2 and JAG1 ligand dimerization

. Additional mechanisms could also contribute to the overall regulation of Notch signalling, such as post-translational modifications of the ligands and receptors, which have been shown to affect Notch activity [21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 60, 61, 62 63, 64, 65 66, 67 68, 69 70, 71 72, 73, 74, 75 76, 77 78, 79 80, 81, 82 83, 84 85, 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389
Researchers developed Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. They demonstrated DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separated autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. The authors also used DPM to cluster gene expression datasets summarized by gene signatures, introducing a novel procedure for summarizing a signature on a different dataset than where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. They found associations between disease and clusters by DPM, replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering, and presents a method to do so, DPM. Additionally, it presents a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, showing value by summarizing gene expression from patients with IMD using relevant signatures and clustering by DPM. DPM offers advantages in conveying uncertainty about clustering and inferring number of clusters, adapting a standard Dirichlet process model to data with uncertainty. Accounting for uncertainty alters clustering solutions, demonstrated on simulated and real applications. Clustering by similarity has applications in bioinformatics, such as identifying subgroups of disease, inferring gene function, and regulatory relationships, and clustering diseases. Methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in observations, including distance, representative sampling, and adapting likelihood. Uncertainty alters solutions, illustrated on simulated data, with DPM closer to points with lower uncertainty, and methods to empirical mean. DPM shifts data towards cluster, resulting in smaller variance.
Researchers designed artificial image datasets to investigate why deep neural networks fail to use shape features when classifying images, instead relying on color and texture. They trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and combinations, showing that some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent, specifically the alignment of gradients for color and texture features with classes. Reducing this alignment enables networks to learn shape classification. Convolutional networks, except for ResNet50, can learn shape-based classification, indicating the bias is due to learning, not architecture. Training on stylized images and avoiding small crops can increase shape sensitivity but still fails to make networks sensitive to global features. The study suggests that learning algorithms, not architecture, is the limiting factor for convolution networks.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

    The present study provides two major findings. First we have demonstrated the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches by using: tokens, to represent the quantities of molecules in a compact way, and counters to abstract the dynamics of cell-specific phenotypes. Second, we developed the first model of HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion

. Importantly, simulation studies demonstrated the regulatory role of HSC inactivation loops during liver fibrosis and predicted the accumulation of inactivated HSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from 102 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression.

. In addition the inactivation processes remain poorly understood and information is lacking about the fate of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) during liver fibrosis and reversion. The present study aims to decipher HSC dynamics by developing multiscale models which integrate for the first time all the HSC states during the development of fibrosis and its reversion

We integrated information based on literature, to describe HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and its reversion however the lack of some information led us to propose hypotheses and finally to develop three different families of models. As shown in Fig 1A, the three families share common processes involving the different states of HSCs regulated by TGFβ1. In normal liver, HSCs are maintained in a non-proliferative quiescent state ( qHSC ) and store vitamin A

. Using the Kappa language, our model describes the interactions between all cell populations and molecules such as transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) which induces HSC activation and promotes secretion of type I collagen, the major component of ECM [23]. We validated the predicted ECM dynamics using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis

. While the role of TGFβ1 in HSC activation is well established, our model showed how its concentration, the number of stimuli and their periodicity influence the dynamics of liver fibrosis. These observations underline the adaptability of the model to the different pathophysiological conditions associated with the development of fibrosis

. The final stage of fibrosis, cirrhosis, leads to complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with a high mortality rate worldwide [1]. Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) is the main process underlying hepatic fibrosis [2]. In a normal liver, HSCs are quiescent, store vitamin A and are located in the Disse space between hepatocytes and endothelial cells that delineate sinusoids

. Upon liver injury, HSCs are activated and transdifferentiate into ECM-secreting myofibroblasts ( MFB ) that contribute to tissue repair. In chronic liver disease, the inflammatory signal persists, leading to sustained HSC activation, ECM accumulation and fibrosis [2–4]. Importantly, reversibility or regression of liver fibrosis after elimination of the inflammatory agent has been observed in experimental models and clinical studies [5, 6]

. To overcome this molecular and cellular complexity while keeping remodeling process into our own model, we introduced tokens to represent low and high remodeling COL1. In this way we modeled both collagen accumulation during TGFβ1 stimulation and its regression upon TGFβ1 withdrawal. The process of inactivating HSC-derived MFBs has been presented as a key element in the reversion of fibrosis enabling the elimination of ∼ 50% of MFBs [24, 25]

. As shown in supplementary Fig S2-C, the model captured the increase in COL1 but reversion dynamics were too fast, suggesting that for this condition the model requires additional regulators. Recent single-cell studies have demonstrated the great heterogeneity of HSCs and MFBs during the development of fibrosis [17, 28, 56]

. This phenomenon is associated with the elimination of myofibroblasts, involving processes of apoptosis, senescence and inactivation, but the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the repair/fibrosis balance remains unclear. Understanding the behavior of HSCs during liver injuries requires multiscale modeling approaches. Such approaches have been widely developed for modeling biological processes [7] and diseases [8, 9]

. Thus, our model provides biological predictions for the reactivation loop, the dynamics of inactivated cells and their accumulation during fibrosis progression. These predictions have been validated either experimentally in a mouse model of CCl4-induced fibrosis, or using RNA sequencing data from patients with fibrosis.

. In these Kappa models, the hepatic stellate cells are the agents which are characterized by three sites ( Fig 1C ) which are: i ) the cell_state of HSCs ( qHSC, aHSC, MFB, iHSC, react_HSC, react_MFB, apop_sene_MFB ), ii ) the TGFB1_binding that can be free or bound and iii ) the state of the TGFβ1 receptor ( TGFBR ) that can be localized at the membrane, internalized or degraded

. RBM approaches were therefore the most appropriate to represent the known interactions operating on stellate cells during fibrosis development and reversion. Based on site graph rewriting, BioNetGen [45] and Kappa [21, 22] are the two major languages used for RBM implementation and simulation

. We introduced a pair of counters ( called intermediary-step and control_counter ) to scale the intermediate steps between cell physiological states, and we used 4 tokens to describe TGFβ1 and collagen molecules. The resulting families of models contained 75 to 77 rules and 37 to 41 parameters, depending on families. All rules are available in the GitHub repository: https://github. com/MBougueon/HSC_model_Kappa. We detailed here the representative rules of the biological processes

. These rules are grouped into 7 biological processes: 1 ) qHSC renewal, 2 ) binding of TGFβ1 to HSCs, 3 ) TGFBR dynamics, 4 ) HSC activation and differentiation, 5 ) HSC proliferation, 6 ) COL1 production and elimination and 7 ) MFB inactivation ( detailed in Methods section ). To identify the families of models that predict HSC behaviors and collagen accumulation that fits with the experimental data from Kiesseleva et al

. This was associated with the presence of inactivated stellate cells ( iHSCs ) which display an enhanced response to TGFβ1 when stimulated in cell culture, leading to faster and greater production of COL1 [24, 25, 38]. These iHSCs would therefore still be present in the “repaired” liver after six months of reversion. To take this into account, we calibrated our models reactMFB-with-inactivation on Kisseleva’s observations et al

. Note that the global evaluation of collagen deposits using Sirius red [24] and SHG microscopy may overestimate the contribution of HSCs since other cells can contribute to liver fibrosis such as portal fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived cells [34]. However, HSCs have recently been shown to be the exclusive source of myofibroblasts in CCl4-treated mice [35]. Our model predicts the accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease which is supported by RNA sequencing data from patients with NASH associated liverosis.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework for estimating the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases. The method, called MEGA, requires only summary statistics and allows for between-study heterogeneity due to factors like genomic platforms and ethnicity. Simulations showed it is computationally efficient and yields satisfactory results comparable to individual-level data analysis when no heterogeneity is present. MEGA was applied to 5 studies from the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program with 580 participants to estimate the effect of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub. Meta-analysis can be an alternative to individual-level analysis in terms of feasibility and evaluating heterogeneity across factors for diseases and genomic technologies, as shown in application to Framingham Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The M d2 measure can characterize overall effect and individual mediators. In MEGA, adjusted for BMI, sex, age, smoking, status, race/ethnicity, expression platform, and top PCs of gene data as covariates. The analysis led to different estimates and 95% CIs from meta due to several reasons. Meta and systematic reviews have applied mediation to health outcomes, but methodology is underexplored in high-dimensional analysis, particularly estimating total effect of high omics mediators. Gene data used overlapping transcripts across cohorts, resulting in loss of large transcripts. Fixed-effects meta results investigated total effect of expression between age and systolic BP across 5 TOP cohorts. The sample and number of profiled transcripts varied.
Researchers have developed a novel method, PWH, to identify driver genes responsible for cancer development in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH prioritizes genes based on their impact on downstream gene expression across a group of patients with similar mutations and gene profiles. Experiments on 16 cancer datasets from TCG showed PWH excels in identifying known drivers and tumor-specific genes. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PWH outperformed existing methods. Results demonstrated PWH can identify both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improve tumor stratification and provide insights into heterogeneity. One predicted gene, LRP1, was validated in vitro assays, promoting cell proliferation. PWH is a genome/transcript analysis that leverages influence of mutated genes on networks across samples. It hypothesizes samples with same cancer type share molecular characteristics compared to different types. Leveraging samples from same type improves driver prediction. PWH requires somatic mutations, gene profiles, and interaction. For each type, predicted genes were compared to other methods based on overlap with known drivers. PWH quantifies impact by generalized walks on hypergraph. Evaluated across 16 types and benchmarked against existing methods, PWH demonstrates superior performance. Identifying personalized drivers is crucial for precision medicine. PWH provides precise prioritization of known drivers for patients. For each type, aggregated candidate rankings created a prioritization. This allowed comparison with cohort methods. PWH shows variability across types, but most samples demonstrate enrichment in tumor-specific genes. A baseline method randomly selected genes as drivers. PWH scores can be ranked to prioritize candidates. Two benchmark measures compared methods' ability to identify drivers. PWH excels in identifying both common and rare genes. Predicted profiles improve stratification and provide oncologists with candidates for treatment. A predicted gene, LRP, was validated in vitro, promoting proliferation.
This study presents the Virtual Epileptic (VEP) model, a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities, capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG, allowing for evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. The study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, yielding high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and superior performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase model was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. The study aims to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. The VEP model integrates mathematical modeling of neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain involved in seizure generation and propagation. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights into mechanisms of data-generating pathological conditions, such as dynamics and connectivity of abnormal networks. The study revealed robustness and efficiency of the SaSS solver in addressing complex estimation associated with V models, outperforming other parallel solvers in most problems and exhibiting performance when scaling processors. Using Bayesian for hyperparameter tuning, performance was further improved.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tuberculosis ( TB ), the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a major health problem with 10. 6 million cases of the disease and 1. 6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0. 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0. 18 in H37Rv ). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”.

    In this study we followed the kinetics of replication of a pathogenic Mtb strain HN878 containing an unstable, “replication clock” plasmid pBP10 in rabbit lungs. We determined that this plasmid is lost from HN878 in vitro with a segregation coefficient s = 0. 1 ( Fig 2 ) suggesting that the plasmid is more stable in this strain as compared to H37Rv [17]

. Interestingly, Gill et al. [17] calculated that 1. 3 × 107 CFU/ml of total bacteria or, assuming a lung weight of 150mg, about 2. 6 × 106 are bacteria produced in the whole lung of B6 mice infected with H37Rv over 111 days of infection. We conclude here that HN878-pBP10 in rabbits undergoes a larger number of replications than a more commonly used lab strain H37Rv in mice further highlighting differences between these Mtb strains and host species

. Taken together, two alternative approaches that we and others have used to accurately describe the dynamics of pBP10-containing H37Rv strain of Mtb in B6 mice could not explain the data on HN878-pBP10 growth dynamics in rabbit lungs. There may be several potential reasons for an increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells between 28 and 56 days post-infection. One possibility is an experimental error in measuring the percent of plasmid-bearing cells

. Here we extend these studies by showing that even when measuring Mtb numbers in the whole lung of rabbits, along with the percent of bacterial cells carrying plasmid pPB10, we can detect and to a degree quantify heterogeneity in rates of Mtb replication and death in vivo

. To gain better insights into how immunity controls Mtb dynamics, our future work will focus on correlating estimated replication and death rates with magnitude of immune response components in individual granulomas of rabbits. Our work opens avenue for future research of Mtb growth dynamics in TB granulomas. Transforming pBP10 plasmid into other clinical Mtb isolates would allow to compare how these strains replicate in various animal models

. This balance is most likely maintained by immune response to Mtb [17]. Gill et al. [17] elegantly addressed this question of static equilibrium in a mouse model of TB. They used H37Rv strain of Mtb transformed with an unstable plasmid pBP10, dubbed a “replication clock plasmid”. The plasmid was lost at a constant rate with each cell division in vitro allowing to count the number divisions cells have undergone over time

. We followed the total number of bacteria and the percent of plasmid-bearing cells in rabbit lungs over time. Interestingly, the percent of plasmid-bearing cells did not decline monotonically as has been previously observed with H37Rv-pPB10 strain in B6 mice, and our previous mathematical model failed to accurately fit the observed data on Mtb CFU in the lung. Rather, a model in which Mtb population in the lung consists of at least 2 somewhat independent populations fitted the data better

. 10 for HN878-pBP10. To study the dynamics of HN878-pPB10 in vivo, we infected rabbits with aerosolized bacteria ( ∼ 500 CFU ) and measured the number of all bacteria or of plasmid-bearing cells in the lungs at different time points after the infection ( Fig 3A )

Tuberculosis ( TB ), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a global health threat. In 2021, 1. 6 million people died due to TB despite available effective chemotherapy [1]. The infection with Mtb results in heterogeneity of disease outcomes such as bacterial clearance, bacterial persistence, and active disease with and without lung cavitation [2–4]

. Importantly, we found similar numbers of bacteria in the left and right lungs even though there was a tendency of observing higher CFU numbers in the right lung ( S2 Fig ) ; this is similar to our recent observation in B6 mice [25]. In parallel, we also infected rabbits with original strain HN878 ( not carrying the plasmid ) ; we found similar CFU numbers in the lung with two Mtb strains suggesting that the plasmid pBP10 did not impact replication ability of the NH878 strain ( S3 Fig )

. g., [6, 8] ). Most of what we know about within-host Mtb dynamics early after infection comes from animal studies [9–12]. Yet, despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of TB and the replication dynamics of Mtb during acute and chronic stages of infection remains poorly understood. Earlier studies reported that Mtb can persist in non-replicating status in tissues especially under hypoxic conditions, which may help it resist antibiotic-mediated killing [13]

. Stochastic simulations of Mtb dynamics suggest that it is possible to use replication clock plasmid ( and HN878-pBP10 specifically ) to estimate the rates of Mtb turnover in individual lesions in lungs of rabbits, paving the way to rigorously understand why individual granulomas in a given animal vary dramatically in the number of viable bacteria.

. More recent work used the ratio of abundance of short- vs. long-lived ribosomal RNA ( RS ratio ) to further confirm that Mtb may indeed be replicating during the chronic stage of infection in murine lungs [23]. While infection of B6 mice with Mtb is a widely used animal model of TB it has some limitations. Typically mice are infected with conventional doses ( ∼ 100 bacteria ) that likely exceed infection dose of humans [24, 25]

. As far as we are aware, our study is the first one to provide quantitative estimates of how quickly pathogenic Mtb strain HN878 replicates in rabbit lungs after aerosol infection. It is difficult to directly compare our estimates with those published previously ( e. g., [17, 22] ) given that we found that previous models do not adequately describe our experimental data. The highest replication rate we estimated was r = 1. 04/day, higher than that for H37Rv in mice ( r = 0

. Furthermore, in the same animal some lesions may heal and some may become more active ( determined, for example, by using PET/CT technology, [30] ) but the reasons for such discordant dynamics ( e. g., is this due to changes in replication and/or death rates? ) remain unknown. In this study we used a clinical Mtb isolate HN878, transformed with the replication clock plasmid pBP10, to infect rabbits via aerosol challenge

. Our results thus may further help explain the differential response of Mtb-infected rabbits to drug treatment and may help design better treatment strategies depending on the distribution of granulomas with slow or rapidly replicating bacteria. Our work has several limitations. Estimated segregation coefficient s of the plasmid pBP10 in HN878 strain differed slightly between two culturing conditions and the plasmid loss kinetics was changing over time ( Fig 2 )

. Finally, a large increase in the number of bacteria in the lung at late time points may have been due to an increase in plid-bearing cells rather than an increase in total number of bacteria ( Fig 3 ).
Researchers have developed a computational tool called GlycanModeler to predict the structure of glycans, which are carbohydrate molecules attached to proteins. Glycans are difficult to model due to their complex chemistry and conformation diversity. Glycaner uses kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was benchmarked on a set of glycan structures and showed high accuracy in de novo modeling and density-guided building. Glycaner was used to design glycans onto a protein nanoparticle to shield regions from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will aid glycoprotein prediction, glycan modeling, and structure determination.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for protein glycosylation, structural validation, analysis, and docking. Recent methods focus on glycan building and refinement using experimental density, especially for structures with many glycans. Glycaner was tested to build structures using crystallographic density to guide and decoy discrimination. Automated glycop modeling must sample chemist, branching, and kinematics to build glycans into density.

Glyer was rigorously optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, with a median RMS of 2.7A. Rosetta protocols continue to be optimized, and deep learning becomes integral to modeling and design. Glyer was used to predict glycans de novo, build into density, and Sugarcoat protein surfaces. The tool was benchmarked on high-resolution glycan structures using SimpleMetrics and rota_scripts, showing high accuracy in de novo and density-guided modeling. Glycans may be forced into higher internal states through local contacts, but low conformations found by Glyer are indicative of probable solution states.

Glyer was used to design glycans onto a protein vaccine scaffold, reducing reactivity in immunization. The tool provides interfaces for creation and evaluation of protocols, and a knowledge-based function to evaluate designs. Glyer was previously used to build glycans into crystallog or cryo density with sub-A accuracy. The modular nature of Rosetta and tools allow them to be used in complex modeling tasks.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate. F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity. The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors, such as BrlA, CreA, XlnR, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus. A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex. Under glucose signal, PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway, along with impaired conidiation. Under cellulose signal, transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated. When PoFbx23 is present, PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions. PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification. Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein. Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene, including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1, the hemicellulase gene xyn11A, and the pigmentation-related gene abrB. PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals.

   . reesei, and N. crassa [36, 37]. P. oxalicum can be employed as a model system to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression. In this study, a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. The PoFbx23 recognizes and activates the transcription factor PoAce1 within the nucleus. PoAce1 is a ubiquitinated protein

. As transcription factor Ace1 has been demonstrated to be a negative regulator for transcription of the ( hemi ) cellulase gene in various fungi [26–28], it was initially assumed that the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes could be repressed in the Pofbx23 deletion mutant. However, the RT-qPCR and transcriptome results of ( hemi ) cellulase genes proved that the initial assumption was wrong

. The finding also indirectly supported our result that the PoAce1 is the direct substrate of the SCFFbx23 complex. Among the 44 potential interacting proteins, three transcriptional regulators were identified. All three transcription factors PDE_04990 ( UniProt: S7ZH90 ), PDE_04678 ( UniProt: S8AUB2 ), and PDE_09448 ( UniProt: S7ZVN6 ) are Zn2Cys6 class fungal-specific transcription factors ( S4 Spreadsheet, Sheet1, row 30, 33 and 37 ) ( Fig 9C )

. The critical components of UPS are crucial for the fungal growth, development, and enzyme synthesis of various filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Neurospora, and Trichoderma [11]. During mycelial growth, 20% of the proteins in the nucleus of Aspergillus nidulans become ubiquitinated [12]. Ubiquitin ligase E3, such as the SCF complex, undergoes rapid FBP exchange to recognize different substrates to respond to physiological changes in the cell or adapt to external environments

. This finding underscores the vital role of PoFbx23 in maintaining PoAce1’s activity. By integrating the discoveries from this study with the wealth of knowledge from previous research on the Fbx23 protein and the transcription factor SltA/Ace1 in P. oxalicum and other fungi [26–31], we propose a model about PoFbx23-Ace1 regulating gene transcription ( Fig 10 ). In the WT strain, PoFbx23 is found in the nucleus in three different states: ( 1 ) most of the PoFbx23 protein is free

. This finding contradicts earlier research, which indicates that Ace1 is a negative regulator of the transcription of the ( hemi ) cellulase gene in P. oxalicum and other cellulase-producing fungi [26–28]. The repressing activity of PoAce1 seems lost due to Pofbx23 deletion

. However, it is yet unknown how Ace1/SltA is regulated into its active form. P. oxalicum is a typical saprophytic fungus. It contains many transcription factors such as BrlA, which regulates fungal asexual development, CreA, XlnR, and Ace1, which regulate ( hemi ) cellulase gene transcription, conserved in various fungi such as Aspergillus, Trichoderma, and Neurospora [27, 32]

. Therefore, we propose that PoFbx23 is the transcriptional coactivator of PoAce1. The ubiquitin ligase SCF complex plays a crucial role in gene transcription by influencing the activity and stability of transcription factors through two pathways: proteasome-dependent ( proteolytic ) and proteasome-independent ( nonproteolytic ) [4]

. The results of RT-qPCR and transcriptome support a negative correlation between the regulatory function of PoFbx23 protein and the transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. Since ( hemi ) cellulase synthesis is usually controlled at the transcriptional level, increased transcription of the ( hemi ) cellulase gene in the Δfbx23 mutant may result in a rise in ( hemi ) cellulase synthesis. Fungal ( hemi ) cellulases are secreted extracellularly

. Deleting or disrupting the ace1 gene in T. reesei, Penicillium oxalicum, and Rasamsonia emersonii increases the expression of the ( hemi ) cellulase genes [26–28]. The homolog of Ace1 is named SltA in Aspergillus sp. SltA is found to be involved in hyphal development, conidiation, sterigmatocystin biosynthesis, and virulence in different Aspergillus sp. [29–31]. These results highlight the variety of Ace1/SltA regulatory roles

. These fungi share similar mechanisms for regulating asexual development and the transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. For example, BrlA was reported as the key asexual developmental regulator in many Aspergillus sp. and P. oxalicum [33–35]. CreA/Cre1 has been found to repress cellulase gene expression by recruiting corepressor complex Tup1-Cyc8 in P. oxalicum, T. reesei, and N. crassa [36, 37]. P

. The Cys2His2 ( C2H2 ) -type transcription factor Ace1/SltA conserved in various filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Neurospora, Magnaporthe, Fusarium, and Beauveria, plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of target genes. Ace1, a negative regulator for ( hemi ) cellulase gene transcription, was first discovered in Trichoderma reesei [26]. Deleting or disrupting the ace1 gene in T

. In the absence of PoFbx23, despite PoAce1 protein being more stable and accumulating, it no longer binds to the target gene and takes on an inactive form; the expression of the target gene is reduced due to the dysfunctional PoAce1. An individual F-box protein can perform different functions in response to different signals [10]. In cellulase-producing fungi like T. reesei and P

. nidulans AnAce1 was discovered in the 23 proteins which were pulled down as potential interacting proteins with AnFbx23 [15], it is reasonable to conclude that Fbx23-Ace1 pair is conserved in Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp.. The discovery of the Fbx23-Ace1 pair can provide help in related research of other filamentous fungi.

. The involvement of PoFbx in the regulation of Ace/Slt in P. oxum and other filamentous fungi highlights the role of the SCF complex in transcriptional regulation. The SCF complex plays a crucial role in proteolytic and nonproteoly regulation of transcription factors [4]. PoF23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of Ace1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals. In the absence of Po23, the Ace1 protein is stable but dysfunctional and no longer binds to the promoter of the target genes including cellulase cb1, eg1 and x11, and pigmentation abrB. Po23 acts as a transcription coactivator of Ace1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repress ) under signals. Po23 acts as a transcription coactivator of Ace1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different ( activating or repress ) under signals. Po23 acts as transcription coactivator of Ace, allowing latter to regulate transcription target genes with different ( activating or repress ) under signals. Po23 acts as transcription activator of Ace, allowing latter to regulate target genes with ( activating or repress ) signals. Po acts as transcription activator of Ace, allowing latter to regulate genes with ( activating repress ) signals.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues, and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis. However, the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. Here, we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. First, we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. When both routes were abolished, BM production was fully blocked; however, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Moreover, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context. First, the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization. Second, the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route. Altogether, these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes.

   . On the basis of the present results, we propose the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes as the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development.

. Analyses of BM protein secretion in single cells revealed that this diversification is due to Rab10-driven lateral and planar polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion. We also found that the DAPC is part of the same cell compartment as Rab10 and influences the planar polarization of Rab10-dependent secretion. Moreover, we found that the exocyst complex is required the formation of homogenous BM.

Proper BM protein secretion and BM diversification are essential for development. Our work brings new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrates that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites. Strikingly, these routes are highly integrated in the different polarity axes ( i. e. apical basal cell polarity and planar cell polarity ) ( Fig 7J )

. This synergic effect of Rab8 and Rab10 KD suggests that these two Rabs are part of alternative routes with a partial redundancy for addressing BM proteins. Moreover, the longitudinal view of the epithelium suggested the presence of a proper basement membrane, but on the apical side. However, the planar view indicated that apically secreted BM proteins assembled in aberrant discontinuous structures, as observed in other genotypes leading to apical BM secretion ( S1C Fig ) [28]

. Nonetheless, the absence of BM protein apical secretion in the Dys mutants indicated that they behaved differently than a Rab10 loss of function ( Fig 5G, 5H and 5J ). We hypothesized that DAPC recruits vesicles containing BM proteins for the Rab10 route and that in its absence, all BM proteins use the Rab8-dependent route, leading to the exclusive formation of homogenous BM

. Altogether, these data identified Dys and Rab10 as part of a highly planar polarized subcellular compartment, with structures reminiscent of tubular endosomes. This compartment contained BM proteins and was oriented towards the BM protein cell exit site, suggesting that Rab10 and the DAPC act together to regulate their lateral secretion. To investigate DAPC involvement in the Rab10 route, we analyzed their functional relationship

. Thus, Dys is required for Rab10 recruitment by Dg. Interestingly, Rab10 delocalization induced by Dg OE allowed us to test specifically the role of the planar-polarized lateral secretion versus unpolarized secretion from the whole lateral periphery. We analyzed BM protein secretion in Dg OE follicle cells. FF quantification revealed a slight increase following Dg OE ( S4J–S4L Fig )

. In mutant Dys or Dg follicles, the BM is devoid of BM fibrils. Moreover, epistasis experiments with Rab10 suggest a functional link between these actors [26]. However, how DAPC participates in BM fibril formation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the routes leading to BM formation in the follicular epithelium. Genetic evidence indicates that Rab8 and Rab10 define two parallel routes, forming homogenous BM and BM fibrils, respectively

. Rab10 overexpression leads to an increased lateral accumulation of BM proteins and of BM fibrils, suggesting its implication in the formation of these fibrils [25]. BM fibril formation requires dystroglycan ( Dg ), a membrane receptor for BM proteins, and dystrophin ( Dys ), an F-actin interacting protein [26]. Dg and Dys are the two core components of the evolutionarily conserved dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) [27]

. Here, these routes could be considered as partially redundant because they are all involved in BM protein secretion and all three must be knocked down to completely block it. However, the integration of these routes to cell polarity clearly allowed distinguishing the spatial specificity of these three Rab proteins and revealed that they compete with each other. The next obvious question is how these routes are differentially integrated with cell polarity

. It has been previously shown that the apical secretion observed in the Rab10 KD can be suppressed by Rab11 KD, suggesting that Rab11 may define a cryptic route for BM protein secretion [23]. We tested this hypothesis by knocking down all three genes ( Rab8, Rab10 and Rab11 triple KD ). In this condition, apical secretion was completely blocked, and BM proteins were in big intracellular blobs ( Fig 1G and 1I )

. In both approaches, we observed a partial colocalization of Col IV and Rab10 in the most basal Rab10-positive compartment. As this compartment was very close to the trailing edge of the cell where BM proteins are secreted and where Rab10 is also localized, we assumed that it corresponded to an important intermediate step of this secretory route. Dys and Dg are both required for BM fibril formation, suggesting that they may be part of the Rab10 route [26]

. Altogether, these results show that Rab8 and Rab10 define two distinct routes, each responsible for a different BM type ( homogenous matrix and fibrils, respectively ) and in competition with each other. To explain how Rab8 and Rab10 allow the formation of distinct BM types, we investigated the cell exit site of BM proteins. It has already been shown that Rab10 OE increases the lateral secretion of BM proteins, using immunostaining against BM proteins without permeabilization [25]

. The high conservation of the interaction domain on Dys, a domain with no other known interacting protein, suggests that this interaction has been conserved during evolution and may be relevant in other contexts. Our work identified distinct actors of the Rab8- and Rab10-dependent routes for BM protein secretion, with the involvement of the DAPC and exocyst complexes

. Moreover, several of our results are in favor of a direct involvement of Dys and Dg in the Rab10 route. First, Dys is highly associated with the Rab10 compartment, and DAPC is required for BM fibril formation. Second, in the absence of Dys, BM protein diversion towards the apical domain is increased upon Rab8 KD. This result excludes a model in which Dys participates in BM fibril formation only after BM protein secretion

. However, probably as a direct consequence of Rab10 redistribution all around the cells, we noticed the presence of very long and intense fibrils that remained trapped between the lateral domain of the follicle cells in the axis of cell migration ( Figs 5U and S4L ). As recently reported in another genetic context affecting BM secretion routes and where similar lateral fibrils were described, their presence disrupted the cell geometry ( Fig 5T and 5U and [28] )

. Altogether, these data underly that BM protein secretion planar polarization is required to maintain the epithelial structure. They also show that Dg is sufficient to reorient the Rab10 route. To understand how Rab10 and the DAPC could be connected, we noticed that the exocyst subunit Exo70 was identified as a Dys interactor using a large scale two-hybrid proteomic approach [35]. Exocyst is an octameric complex, very conserved from yeast to humans

. This link has been shown in other systems, including BM remodeling, suggesting that it might be a general feature of the Rab8-dependent route [48–52]. However, we showed, for the first time, the involvement of exocyst in BM secretion. Importantly, the absence of basal secretion in Exo70 mutants and the genetic evidence of Exo70 requirement for the Rab8 route confirm that the Rab8 route is targeted towards the basal domain of the cells

. To understand how Rab10 contributed to the lateral planar-polarized secretion of BM proteins, we compared the subcellular localization of Rab10 and of BM components. It has already been shown that Rab10 is present in the planar-polar tubular compartment [25]. We found that DAP is also present in the same compartment as Rab10 and is required for the planar-polar secretion of Rab10. Moreover, in the absence of Dys, BM proteins are secreted apically, suggesting that Dys is required for the planar-polar secretion of Rab10. This is consistent with the idea that DAP is part of the plan-polar tubular compartment and is required for the planar-polar secretion of Rab10

Our results show that Rab and Rab10 define two parallel routes for BM secretion with different cell exit sites and that compete with each other. We found that the DAP is part of the plan-polar tubular compartment and required for plan-polar secretion of Rab10. Moreover, the exoc complex is required for the basal secretion of Rab8 and interacts with Dys to limit the planar polarization of Rab10. These results highlight the mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and illustrate how BM diversification can arise from the control of distinct routes.
Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach. The model, named language-based universal model (LBUM), was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb data. The LBUM outperformed classical machine learning algorithms, random forests (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GB), and showed improved generalizability across HIV-1 subtypes. The model's performance increased with the size and diversity of the training data, and pretraining with non-bAb data improved generalizability. The LBUM learned patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bn combinations. Antibody contexts, unique vector representations of each antibody, were used to predict epitopes. The model's performance degraded with longer input sequences, but performed better on partial Env. Publicly available datasets are imbalanced in HIV-1 subtypes, compromising models' generalizability to underrepresented subtypes, a problem called subtype bias. The LBUM mitigated subtype bias when trained on all subtypes. The model can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of pathways is associated with disease development and progression. This study considered two strategies to construct predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 sources providing pathway information were implemented in microarray data for MM (GSE324) and a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. The candidate was compared with gene-based model and published in external data. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive in prediction than gene model both internal and external validation. Immune information including V pathways was more predictive for MM and ax outperformed previously models. The model was more resistant to missing values and presence of missing (5%) did not deteriorate accuracy using data imputation. Pathway-based models using lasso were competitive to gene models for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) where data imputation method was integrated for future validation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission. We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one, μ. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+, k−, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection.

   . The TFR defined from the nondimensionalization of the Fission Model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k -, where M is the total concentration on Mff; k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, between oligomers and single Drp1-Mff complexes on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The parameter μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers

The lack of information in the literature about the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and Mff ( k1, k−1 ), oligomerization on the OMM ( k+, k− ), and the rate of mitochondrial fission ( f ( i ) ) motivated our investigation of how different parameter choices affect the total fission rate with the goal of identifying regulatory parameters which fine tune mitochondrial fission

. Even though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the cumulative total fission ( TF ), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one of them, μ. Thus we identify μ to be a key regulatory parameter for Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission.

Mitochondrial fission is the process of a mitochondrion dividing into two daughter organelles. The Fission Model presented here is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) which focus on Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission following cellular injury when the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol is increased

. However, Drp1 has been observed to persist on newly created mitochondrial ends for a significant period of time [15]. This delay in the release of Drp1 could be incorporated into the Fission Model with the addition of a delay term or with an additional pool of post fission complexes. Either model addition would affect the available pool of cytosolic Drp1 and possibly cause the total concentration of Drp1 ( T ) to have more of an effect on the TFR and the cumulative TF

. Drp1 oligomerizes to form a chain like structure, an oligomer, which wraps around the mitochondria leading to a fission event. While Drp1 recruitment, oligomerization, and interaction with outer mitochondrial membrane receptors is known to occur [13, 18, 19], the specific contributions of these processes to the fission rate is incompletely understood. Therefore there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial dynamics

Under extreme metabolic or environmental stress, mitochondria can enter a state of hyperfission which leads to lower functioning, smaller mitochondria and an increase in programmed cell death [7, 8]. However, a total inhibition of fission through deletion of key mitochondrial fission proteins also has negative effects [11]. Thus there exists a need to understand the molecular mechanisms which fine-tune mitochondrial fission to preserve mitochondrial function without deleting key players

. After a fission event, Drp1 tetramers and Mff proteins instantly return to their respective unbound pools within the model ( Fig 2 ). The Fission Model is a common pool model and represents the fission activity of an entire cell. Therefore, the concentration of Mff on the OMM is the concentration across all mitochondria. The model focuses on the oligomerization process in order to better understand how changes upstream of a fission event affect the number of fission events per second

. Drp1 is recruited to the OMM and binds to membrane receptors such as mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ), MiD49, and MiD51 [13, 17–20]. The receptor Mff is essential for recruiting Drp1 to mitochondria [17], and over-expression of Mff increases mitochondrial fission while over expression of MiD49 and MiD51 inhibits fission [13, 20]. For these reasons, the nonlinear dynamical systems described below focus on Drp1 and Mff interactions

. We develop a nonlinear dynamical system for a Drp1-dependent fission mechanism and use parameter sensitivity analyses, bifurcation analysis, and a nondimensionalization of the model to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR is the number of fission events per second. We will refer to our nonlinear dynamical system as the Fission Model

. The ER also facilitates mitochondrial constriction prior to Drp1 recruitment [34]. A distribution for mitochondrial circumference could be incorporated into the fission function f ( i ) which would aid in the understanding of how mitochondrial circumference impacts the number of fission events per second

. The Fission Model represents a well mixed cell with an excess of Drp1 tetramers in the cytosol. This excess in cytosolic Drp1 means the concentration of unbound Mff on the OMM dictates the concentration of C1 and by extension, the system’s oscillations. Drp1 in excess also means the cytosolic concentration fluctuates minimally over time. Thus the system of equations can be simplified with a quasi-steady-state approximation by setting the equation for T ˙ ( Eq ( 10 ) ) equal to zero

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that maintain a steady-state through three general processes: mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics ( fission and fusion ) [1–6]. Upon acute stress, mitochondria can undergo hyperfission resulting in an increase in fragmentation, which shifts their size distribution [7]

. Fig 1D shows red mitochondria encircled with a cyan ring structure where the cyan color is from the overlay of green Drp1 and blue Mff. This illustrates Drp1-Mff interactions on the OMM. The model tracks the concentration of these Drp1-Mff complexes as they build oligomers of various sizes. Once an oligomer reaches a sufficient size, which will be discussed in more detail later, a fission event occurs

. Disruptions in the balance between fission and fusion has also been observed to affect normal development, and these disruptions have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases [12] indicating that a balance between fission and fusion is crucial to cell health across diverse cell types. Drp1 is a key player in mitochondrial fission through its interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) [13–17]

. With a nonlinear dynamical system, sensitivity analyses, a nondimensionalization of the system, and a bifurcation analysis we begin to understand how certain parameters affect the total fission rate ( TFR ) which is the number of fission events per second

. ( 6 ) The Fission Model has the following conserved quantities: T= T + γ ( ∑ i = 1 N i C i ), ( 7 ) M= M + ∑ i = 1 N i C i ( 8 ) where T is the total concentration of tetrameric Drp1, M is the total concentration of Mff on the OMM. The corkscrew constriction process of Drp1 oligomers [22, 23] requires full encircling of the mitochondrion. This suggests the fission rate function f ( i ) will be zero below some threshold length

. Another biological phenomenon to consider is the interaction between a mitochondrion and the Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) before a fission event. Drp1 is know to reside on the outer membrane of the ER [33], and the ER forms close contacts with mitochondria at the eventual fission site marking where fission will occurr [34]. Therefore ER-mitochondria interactions most likely affect the availability of Drp1 for fission activity

. If we consider β = k 1 M k - to be less than 5 and fix μ to be greater than or equal to the bifurcation value, which is the value of μ where the TFR transitions to sustained oscillations, we find that the cumulative number of fission ( TF ) does not monotonically increase with μ. Instead, TF increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting k, k, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters such as μ may assist in future therapeutic selection

The fission is the process by which a mitochondrion divides into two daughter organelles. Dr1 is a key player in fission through its interaction with the outer membrane ( OMM ) [13–17]. Dr1 is recruited to the O and binds to receptors such as mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) Mi49 and Mi51 [13 17–20]. The Mff is essential for recruiting Dr1 to mitochondria [17] and over-expression of M increases fission while expression of Mi49 and Mi51 inhibits fission [13 20. Therefore, the dynamical systems below focus on Dr1 and Mff interactions

The Fission Model is a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) which focus on Dr1-dependent fission following cellular injury when the concentration of Dr1 in the cytosol is increased. Dr1 has been observed to persist on newly created ends for a significant time [15. This delay in release of Dr1 could be incorporated into the model with addition of a delay or an additional pool of f complexes. Either addition would affect the pool of cytos Dr1 and possibly the concentration of Dr1 ( T ) have more effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) and cumulative fission ( TF.

    Title: 
    Abstract: CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles. One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. In this study, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest. Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects.

    Our research demonstrated the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct fGD systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both the agricultural pest SWD and the model insect D. melanogaster. The gene drive study on SWD, an economic pest, is highly meaningful. Currently, many researchers are gradually shifting their focus from model organisms to application species and back for further exploration

Gene drive is a novel genetic engineering tool for controlling disease transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive has broad application prospects due to its high specificity and flexibility. It functions by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure their widespread transmission across successive generations

. In certain gene drive systems that aim to induce female infertility by targeting haplosufficient genes, it is impossible to reverse the infertility phenotype in drive homozygous females [6]. Therefore, introduction of wild-type females into the gene drive transgenic population continuously is necessary to maintain the population. In our design, feeding octopamine to female flies can successfully restore their egg-laying defects

. To mitigate the formation of functional resistance alleles, we employed three gRNAs to target the Tdc2 gene, inducing nonfunctional mutations at the desired sites. This design likely reduced the selective pressure for resistance by minimizing the formation rate of functional resistance alleles. The key characteristic of our gene drive systems is that the phenotype of female sterility can be rescued by feeding of octopamine, which is inexpensive

. suzukii nanos promoter. It was effective at population suppression in mathematical simulations with continuous releases of more modest size ( 1:4 ) [12]. This study reports the development of a novel CRISPR-based homing gene drive system targeting the Tdc2 gene with the previously untested vasa promoter in SWD. We demonstrated conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype by feeding octopamine and showed moderate levels of gene drive efficiency that specifically target the Tdc2 locus

. This may facilitate large-scale breeding of gene drive flies and contribute to commercial production [9], reducing costs, implying rearing, and potentially even allowing mass-rearing strategies and continuous releases that require reduced drive performance for successful suppression.

. Thus, a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation, including in-frame indels, would incur substantial fitness costs [2]. Because the drive itself causes recessive female sterility, another important technical aspect of this approach is how to keep large-scale rearing for area-wide releases with a homing suppression element that would otherwise crash due to female sterility

. However, the emergence of resistance alleles through end-joining can inhibit the drive, blocking recognition by the gRNAs and potentially maintaining gene function [3–6]. It should be noted that in this research we use the term "resistance" broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair, causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive. In some lab experiments, resistance to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing drives arise rapidly, especially when using a single gRNA [3, 4, 7]

. Due to the high costs of implementing SIT over large areas, genetic suppression through gene drive technology may be a more favorable option for controlling SWD populations. Targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene, a recently created CRISPR/Cas9-based split gene drive ( sGD ) system in SWD showed 94–99% transmission rates with a line that expressed Cas9 with two nuclear localization sequences from the D. suzukii nanos promoter

. If this process of directional gene conversion, also known as homing, is highly efficient, the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns ( >50% ). Under ideal conditions, the gene drive elements will eventually spread throughout the population. In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes engineered with CRISPR-based gene-drive have achieved close to 100% inheritance of the desired allele across successive generations [2]

. Nonfunctional resistance alleles can impede the spread of the gene drive, especially if they arise from maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNAs. The presence of functional resistance alleles would have an even more significant impact. Comprehensive studies have shown that simultaneous targeting with several gRNAs improves cleavage efficiency and reduces resistance alleles in cage trials [14, 15]

. However, introducing Cas9 protein from another genomic source greatly increased the efficiency of the gene drive system, indicating that position effects may partially account for our SWD results. Using gene drive to manage invasive pest SWD is a promising and innovative approach, but as a species with a high level of genetic polymorphism [24, 25], such genetic background may have a significant impact on the effective spread of gene drive through populations [3, 6]

. Although the constructed full gene drive ( fGD ) system achieved super-Mendelian inheritance in SWD, the observed low rates of cleavage ( Fig 2C ) may indicate low expression levels of Cas9 in the germline. At first, we hypothesized that the SWD vasa promoter strength might be insufficient to produce robust Cas9 expression. Therefore, we built two fGD systems in D. melanogaster and chose two efficient and ubiquitous promoters, hsp70 and Actin5C, to drive expression of SpCas9 [20, 21]

. Unlike D. melanogaster, the female SWD Tdc2 null mutants are still able to lay small numbers of viable eggs, and we did not explore the reason for this. We suspect that the insertion of a large gene drive cassette in the Tdc2 locus might impact neighboring Tdc1 expression and partially rescue the Tdc2 phenotype, potentially allowing the issue to be solved with drive design adjustments such as reversing the orientation of some genes within the drive

. In a Medea gene drive system of SWD [26], the genetic diversity of the population led to the emergence of antitoxin mutants in cage experiments, thus limiting the spread of the drive. The results in our study also showed that the homing rate of gene drive alleles could potentially be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the gRNA targeting sites and homology regions. A recent study showed high efficiency with the SWD nanos promoter driving expression of Cas9 [12]

. We also conducted additional experiments in D. melanogaster to further characterize this drive system. These findings suggest potential applications of Tdc2-targeting gene drives for SWD population management, paving the way for more effective and sustainable pest control strategies.

. Sequencing chromatograms of the gene target sites in both WT flies and NHEJ mutants were analyzed and compared ( S6A Fig ). After cloning and sequencing of the PCR products from two flies occurring NHEJ, we identified a specific type of NHEJ at gRNA1 and gRNA3 ( S6B Fig ). This suggests that although gRNA-induced cleavage occurred in populations, the relatively low cleavage efficiency and homing rate resulted in the failure of spreading gene drive elements within the population

. However, a single injection of donor plasmid containing gRNAs and our vasa-Cas9 into the embryo of SWD achieved successful genome editing, which showed, together with some drive activity, that our vasa promoter was functional in this system. Other homologs of promoters from D. melanogaster could potentially allow for more efficient suppression [27]

. Since the plasmids we constructed expressed both SpCas9 endonuclease and gRNA, a single injection of this exogenous donor plasmid ( 500ng/μL ) into the early embryo of Drosophila achieved successful genome editing. We collected embryos of wild type flies ( both SWD and D. melanogaster ) for microinjection

. Intriguingly, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have unveiled the potential of a specific target gene, tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ). This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of octopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including egg laying [8]

Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in the fruit fly Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest. The system uses three gRNAs to induce nonfunctional mutations at desired sites, reducing the selective pressure for resistance. The design allows for the rescue of the T2 mutant phenotype by feeding octamine, making it easier to maintain the drive in the population. The effectiveness of a similar system was tested in Doph melanogaster, and additional drive systems were constructed with promoter-Cas transgenes to improve homing efficiency. The study shows that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene alleles and the position influences Cas activity. The findings highlight the potential of conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a valuable tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Researchers explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks and proposed two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1) only modifying synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. They introduced an energy measure that assumes energy is used solely by synaptic updates and found an approximate square relation between energy and size, M ∝ N0.43.43. The result shows that large networks learn faster but use more energy, restricting plasticity might save energy. To examine this, they only allowed plasticity in a subset of synapses using a random mask, elements drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. They also found that skipping uninformative samples during learning leads to further savings. The study suggests the presence of a competitive algorithm where only a fraction of synapses is modified, biophysically following resource constraints. The algorithms can be combined with earlier work on synaptic caching. Samples were presented in random order, and batching would require storing updates across samples, which is biologically challenging. Training was not batched and weights updated every sample. No substantial savings were found using adaptive schemes like AD, which would be hard to implement biologically. Instead, a fixed learning rate was used. The most efficient plasticity occurs when 1) only the largest updates are implemented and 2) synapses form a pathway in the network. Selecting the maximum has an advantage over a fixed mask. A small network (100 units) was trained for 30 epochs and accuracy saturated. Plasticity is spatially and temporally limited, unlike backprop which updates every synapse every trial, leading to inefficient learning. The study hypothesizes biological plasticity is designed to be energy-efficient.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors. Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life. During natural or engineered genome streamlining, deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons. We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ), csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ), and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains, though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function. More generally, our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments.

   . In light of these results, questions still remain about the impact of large deletions on an organism’s fitness and how and whether laboratory evolution can recover lost fitness after this type of genome reduction. Previously, we engineered strains of the metabolically versatile and naturally competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx with deletions of large genome segments that each encoded ≥17 nonessential genes [23]

. In this study, we evolved replicate populations of eight reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx in complex and defined medium laboratory environments. Deletions in these strains were constructed without examining the functions or expression levels of the genes being removed, which resulted in substantial fitness defects in some cases. Nevertheless, evolution restored fitness, at least partially, in most instances

We examined fitness recovery of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx strains engineered to have reduced genomes during ~300-generation evolution experiments in complex and defined growth media. Several of the engineered single deletions significantly decreased fitness in one or both media. Following evolution, most of the resulting strains had gained fitness, but two failed to show significant recovery in one of the two environments ( MGD9 in LB and MGD4 in MS )

Previously, we created Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx [13] by deleting all transposable elements from the genome of the laboratory strain ADP1 [24]. Then, we examined possibilities for additional genome streamlining by attempting to construct 55 multiple-gene deletion ( MGD ) strains from ADP1-ISx [23]. Each of the 18 MGD strains that were successfully constructed has a single contiguous stretch of nonessential genes removed

. However, even in these cases, the effects of mutations within this network on gene function varied with the deletion strain and environment in which they evolved. Overall, our results validate laboratory evolution as a strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains, and they illuminate a path forward for engineering a minimal-genome A. baylyi strain.

. baylyi strain that robustly functions in the laboratory. Minimal genome engineering projects in other organisms have avoided deleting genes that, while not essential, are required for robust growth, so-called “quasi-essential” genes [9], and purposefully left highly expressed genes untouched [18]

. Given that microbes that naturally evolve extremely reduced genomes generally become less robust [1], it remains to be seen how far these endeavors that seek to build, remodel, and evolve streamlined genomes can be pushed, whether their goals are to optimize microbial cell factories or understand the essential genetic architectures of cellular life.

. Different outcomes have been reported, however, after evolving strains of E. coli [18] and Bacillus subtilis [14] with cumulative engineered deletions comprising ~20–30% of their genomes. The E. coli strain wholly recovered fitness lost in minimal medium, primarily through rewiring metabolic and regulatory networks [18]. The B. subtilis strain exhibited more limited fitness recovery [14]

. Future work constructing a minimal A. baylyi genome could progress by combining the deletions we describe into a single strain. Some deletions, such as those in MGD15 and MGD17, that did not deleteriously impact fitness should be easy to combine. Deletions with fitness costs, such as MGD6 and MGD12, could be added along with compensatory mutations that evolved in the corresponding ancestor strains in this study. The natural competence of A

. During creation of the transposon-free ADP1-ISx strain [16], we restored the full-length sequence of csrA that was interrupted near its C-terminus by an IS1236 insertion in A. baylyi ADP1. The widespread mutations that we observed in genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation in ADP1-ISx, including csrA, suggest that this earlier transposon insertion was beneficial and that we are observing multiple ways that evolution can reoccur to similarly alter global gene regulation in A

. They probably alter the function of this gene versus resulting in complete loss of function. A transposon that truncates the CsrA protein in A. baylyi relative to other Acinetobacter species was deleted during the creation of ADP1-ISx [16]. ( S2 Data File ). It is possible that the csrA mutations we observe have similar effects on its function to this transposon insertion

. Whole-genome sequencing revealed examples of both deletion-specific and shared genetic targets that recurrently evolved mutations in different populations. The most widespread mutations affected genes in a post-transcriptional global regulatory network. They appear to recapitulate or phenocopy a transposon insertion in the csrA gene in A. baylyi ADP1 that was removed during construction of the transposon-free ADP1-ISx progenitor strain

. MSD2 has a deletion of 69. 8 kb that expands upon one of the original MGD segments ( MGD11 ). It removes 67 genes. To examine how the large deletions affected bacterial fitness, we constructed a GFP-expressing variant of ADP1-ISx. Then, we performed co-culture competition assays comparing this reference strain to each MGD strain and the ADP1-ISx progenitor in a complex medium ( LB ) ( Fig 1B ) and a defined minimal succinate medium ( MS ) ( Fig 1C )

. Further streamlining of A. baylyi genomes to include these deletions and others that could not be constructed [23] would require debugging, for example, by adding back any "irreplaceable" genes that are needed to restore viability and fitness in ways that evolution on laboratory timescales cannot achieve

. We confirmed that the expected ADP1-ISx transposon deletions [13] and strain-specific deletions [23] were present in each ancestor and evolved genome. The annotated reference genome sequence and full details for all predicted mutations are provided in S1 Data File. Final lists of mutations, excluding the engineered deletions, in the evolved clones are provided in S4 Table

. Despite encountering some limitations, the overwhelming result of our study is that evolution is useful for mechanistically probing why there are fitness defects after specific gene deletions and for recovering the fitness of reduced-genome strains. Thus, it should be considered a critical component of strain engineering campaigns that are creating the next generation of simplified, efficient, and more predictable chassis organisms for biotechnology applications

. Deletion of multiple, large genomic regions can also remove genes that individually have little impact on a cell’s function but when removed together produce synthetic lethality [9, 19] or are more deleterious than expected due to "synthetic-sick" interactions [14]. Because of our incomplete understanding of the consequences of deleting genes in top-down streamlined strains, laboratory evolution has been used as a means to recover lost fitness [14, 18]

. baylyi ADP1 reference genome [24] corrected for mutations/discrepancies found in prior sequencing of the ADP1 isolate used by our lab [29]. We annotated the AbsR28 small RNA gene [26] based on a match to Rfam [48] family RF02606 using Infernal [49]. As described previously [46], we used gdtools to simulate evolved genomes and re-ran breseq against these to check our mutation predictions

. This conclusion is supported both by statistical trends in mutation types and direct measurements of the fitness effects of deleting rnd in different strain backgrounds. Yet, mutations in both rnd and csrA evolved in at least one descendant of every engineered deletion stain and their ADP1x progenitor. Mutations in rnd and csr likely compensate for earlier deletion of the transon in the AD1x progenitor of all deletion strains restored csr function.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes. Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases. However, their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context. Here, we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. Using an in vivo reporter strategy, we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we also show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. In addition, we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. Altogether, we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies.

   . Although this approach has proven to be efficient in regulating exogenous constructs, it remains unclear whether engineered self-cleaving ribozymes can control endogenous gene expression in vertebrates. The zebrafish emerged several decades ago as an alternative and powerful vertebrate genetic model [16]. Most genetic tools involving site-directed recombinases and endonucleases have been successfully implemented in zebrafish [17–19]

Self-cleaving ribozymes are already used to control the expression of transgenes and endogenous genes in multiple models [6–8, 10–15]. However, modulating the expression of an endogenous locus in a vertebrate model has never been achieved. In our study, we used T3H48-HHR in zebrafish to modulate the mRNA levels produced from a reporter transgene as well as the alb gene

. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. Furthermore, we created a Flippase- and Cre-inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip, which we also inserted in the alb gene. We show that RiboFlip induction also leads to a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. Together, these new approaches broaden the genetic toolbox available for functional genomics in vertebrates.

. Moreover, the zebrafish model allows the efficient screening of genetic tools because of its external fertilization and rapid early development. Here, we use the zebrafish model to establish a self-cleaving ribozyme-based system to knock down gene expression in vivo

. To this aim, we converted the active T3H48-HHR ribozyme insertion in the alb gene to an inactive version using the ABE-Ultramax ( Umax ) base editing strategy [25] ( Fig 2g ). We found that this conversion very efficiently rescued the pigmentation phenotype in albHHR/b4 embryos ( Fig 2h-k ). Altogether, these data show that the T3H48 ribozyme can induce the cleavage of an endogenous mRNA target in zebrafish

. Altogether, these data show that the T3H48-HHR is an efficient ribozyme for gene knockdown in zebrafish. Robust reduction in transgenic mRNA levels after ribozyme cleavage has already been shown in other models [9, 10, 12]. Here we investigated whether integrating T3H48-HHR in an endogenous locus could induce phenotypes similar to those observed in the mutant. We targeted the alb gene, whose downregulation leads to strong pigmentation defects [20, 23]

. However, these systems are not available in all vertebrate models, are challenging to implement, and display variable efficiency depending on the genomic context. Hence, more flexible approaches are needed to control gene expression. The synthetic biology field has contributed several tools to regulate RNA stability [4]. One promising family of RNA regulatory elements consists of self-cleaving ribozymes, which are short RNA structures capable of catalyzing their own cleavage [5]

. Additional insulating sequences [12] should be assessed to maintain a high cleavage rate in ribozyme arrays. We then evaluated the ability of T3H48-HHR to recapitulate mutant phenotypes using alb as a model. We inserted the ribozyme in the second intron of the alb gene, in a CRISPR site previously used to induce large deletions [24]. We observed a weaker reduction in alb mRNA levels compared with the reporter experiment

. Moreover, hypomorphic phenotypes generated by ribozyme cleavage could be used to investigate genes for which the knockout results in early lethality. We then showed that it is indeed the ribozyme cleavage and not the ribozyme insertion that is responsible for the pigmentation phenotype. We inactivated the T3H48 ribozyme integrated in the alb gene using a base editing strategy

. We also used CRISPR/Cas9 knockin strategies to insert an inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip and show that this system can trigger conditional gene knockdown of the endogenous alb gene. Ribozymes are usually inserted in UTR regions to mediate efficient knockdown throughout the lifetime of mRNAs. As the pre-mRNA is accessible only before splicing, intronic insertions induce lower cleavage rates [6]

. We first use a GFP reporter assay to assess the efficiency of several self-cleaving ribozymes in reducing pre-mRNA levels and find that the T3H48 hammerhead ribozyme ( T3H48-HHR ), when placed in an intron, causes a 20-fold reduction in eGFP mRNA. Next, we show that inserting the T3H48-HHR in the second intron of the albino ( alb ) /slc45a2 gene recapitulates the pigmentation phenotype of the alb mutant [20]

Modulating RNA and protein expression using genetic tools is essential to understand their function in vivo [1]. Spatiotemporal control of gene knockout has become the standard approach in vertebrate model organisms to investigate RNA and protein function. Multiple site-directed tools are available to control gene knockout, including recombinase systems such as Cre/LOX, Flp/FRT, and Dre/ROX, as well as endonuclease-mediated CRISPR editing [2, 3]

. However, their efficiency and specificity could be improved. Since ribozyme-mediated knockdown requires ribozyme integration into the target locus, it provides very high specificity. Moreover, the mRNA knockdown rate of more than 90% that we observed in vivo with the GFP reporter system and in the alb locus has never been achieved with other tools. In summary, our findings indicate that T3H48-HHR can mediate rapid gene knockdown in a vertebrate model when inserted in an intron

The T3H48-HHR and related ribozymes catalyze efficient RNA cleavage in several organisms [9, 11, 14, 15]. However, their efficiency remains untested in a vertebrate model. To do so, we first generated a transgenic cassette that contains two ubiquitous ubb promoters [21] controlling separately an eGFP containing a human β-globin ( hHBB ) intron [22] and mCherry, each followed by a triple SV40 3’UTR to terminate transcription ( Fig 1a )

. To that end, we created a RiboFlip cassette that switches T3H48-HHR to a sense orientation following Flippase or Cre recombination and inserted it in the second intron of the alb gene. Recombination triggers mRNA knockdown and a pigmentation phenotype similar to the effects caused by of T3H48-HHR insertion. The Cre recombination induced a weaker knockdown than the Flippase one, possibly due to the difference in the sequence flanking the ribozyme, which could alter folding

. Spatiotemporal control of the T3H48-HHR and related ribozymes has been achieved in C. elegans [11] and with the use of AAV vectors [15]. However, ribozyme activation in vivo in the endogenous locus of a vertebrate has never been attempted. Here, we designed a cassette called RiboFlip, that allows the activation of T3H48-HHR using Flippase ( Flp ), and the dual activation of T3H48-HHR and a 5XUAS:TagBFP using Cre ( Figs 3a and S3a )

. All ribozymes are flanked by a triple CAAA insulator sequence [10], except the knockin in Fig 2a, which is flanked by a single AAAA insulator. The Ribo cassette was inserted in the second intron of the alb gene using CRISPR/Cas9. We show that RFlip induces a pigmentation similar to that of T3-HHR in the alb gene. Moreover, we show that the pigmentation is reversible by inactivating the ribyme using base editing, demonstrating the specificity of the approach.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1. 1 million nuclei in 20, 000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e. g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience.

    We describe aiSEGcell, a user-friendly software to segment nuclei from only BF images without the need for fluorescent nuclear labeling. Previous research has demonstrated that neural networks can detect nuclei and other cell organelles in transmitted light images under optimized conditions [12, 13, 15]. We now show that nuclear segmentations in BF are also feasible in challenging common experimental conditions like low magnification, and time lapse imaging of e. g

. We release aiSEGcell with already trained models to segment nuclei and whole cells in BF. The software is available as CLI and GUI versions for easy accessibility. Importantly, aiSEGcell utilizes a generic image segmentation approach not limited to BF microscopy [16]

. Here, we present “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly software to segment nuclei in BF images accessible even to users with no prior coding experience. We demonstrate its utility even in challenging prevalent conditions, including low magnification live time lapse imaging of primary cells. This includes small hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells lacking prominent and large cell compartments like cytoplasm, also in microfluidic and other culture devices

. 85 ) revealed that features associated with the nucleus of a cell were more important than features of the whole cell or the cell neighborhood ( S12 Fig ) [27]. We visually confirmed the importance of nuclear features in BF images by directly interpreting aiSEGcell segmentations with Grad-CAM [28] ( S13 Fig ). Removing a fluorescence channel dedicated to image segmentation enables one or even several additional fluorescent markers and thus improved experimental workflows

. Segmentations with aiSEGcell are based on BF images rich in information about cells, cell interactions, and sub-cellular structures. Understanding which information in BF images is crucial for accurate nucleus segmentations can help efficiently assembling data sets for retraining. Therefore, we selected 999 cells from D2 that aiSEGcell segmented accurately ( i. e. high IOU ) and 951 cells from D2 that aiSEGcell segmented poorly ( i. e. low IOU )

. We selected U-Net as the model architecture [12, 14] for aiSEGcell and trained it on 9, 849 BF image and segmentation mask pairs ( >600, 000 nuclei ) of live primary murine hematopoietic cells, like macrophages, stem and progenitor cells, at 20x magnification ( D1 ) [16]. To highlight the need for user-friendly software that segments nuclei in BF, we compared aiSEGcell to widely used nucleus segmentation software Cellpose and StarDist [19, 20]

. Hence, we share our data sets D1-5 containing manually curated nuclear marker ground truth segmentations of more than 20, 000 images, or 1, 100, 000 nuclei, covering 11 unique cell types ( one cell line, 10 primary cell types; Figs 1–3 and Table 1 ). With 20, 000 images and 1. 1 million nuclei, these data sets are among the largest publicly available data sets for fluorescence or label free nucleus segmentation to date [34–37]

. Available pretrained models for nucleus and BF segmentations were not suitable alternatives to the specialized BF nucleus segmentation of aiSEGcell ( S1 Fig and S1 and S2 Tables ). We evaluated aiSEGcell on a second data set ( D2 ) comprised of 6, 243 image-mask pairs ( >300, 000 nuclei ) derived from five independent imaging experiments with experimental settings similar to D1. Cell morphologies included round cells and more complex shaped cells with protruding pseudopodia

. In addition, cell sizes varied by an order of magnitude ( Table 1 ). aiSEGcell segmented nuclei in BF images across morphologically distinct cells and different scales ( Figs 1c and S2a ). We quantified segmentation quality using an adapted version of the F1-score that counted inaccurately predicted objects ( e. g. intersection over union = 0. 4 ) as one error instead of as both, false positive ( FP ), and as false negative ( FN; see Materials and methods )

. However, it is uncertain whether nuclei can be accurately segmented under challenging typical imaging conditions optimized for speed and cells’ health and not for perfect images, such as low magnification BF microscopy. Furthermore, actively maintained, user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in BF is not available. Consequently, widespread experimental adoption remains elusive

. This is further accentuated in notoriously difficult to train neural networks implemented in complex frameworks that are subject to frequent changes [38, 39]. Therefore, it is crucial to release scientific software that is well documented and accessible to programming novices [3, 5, 20, 40]. For the first time, we introduce a software for segmenting nuclei in BF images, proven to work across various computational environments and user coding proficiency levels

. While manual image segmentation is considered the gold standard, segmentation for high throughput microscopy requires computer assistance. Conventional computer-assisted image segmentation is semi-automated and necessitates good signal-to-noise, using a dedicated fluorescence channel for segmenting cells, nuclei, or other targets [3–5]

Conventional cell segmentation approaches use fluorescence to mark cells and cell compartments for segmentation ( Fig 1a ). In contrast, aiSEGcell omits fluorescence markers for segmentation and directly segments BF images ( Fig 1b )

. However, microscopy data are highly diverse and siloed impeding the availability of broadly representative data sets. To address this challenge, crowdsourcing platforms have been used to annotate large data sets [34]. Alternatively, periodic retraining with user provided data has been suggested [20]. Here, we demonstrate that aiSEGcell pretrained on a large data set requires only approximately 30 images to drastically improve segmentation for new use cases

. Consequently, evaluating segmentation models with respect to biologically meaningful read-outs is necessary. The translocation of fluorescently labeled signaling molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and vice versa, in small motile live primary cells imaged with low signal-to-noise is demanding, sensitive to variations in the nuclear mask and has been shown to affect cell behavior and fate [22–24]

. Megakaryocyte nuclei were >2, 000 pixels in size and noise level deviations of a few pixels did not impede the explanatory power of object-wise pixel-level performance metrics ( i. e. IOU ). U-Net was selected as model architecture due to its wide and robust applicability in biological image segmentation [16, 63]. Leaky ReLU and batch normalization were used in convolutional blocks [64, 65]

. The best model was selected based on the highest average image-wise F1-score on the validation set. We used Cellpose version 3. 0. 7 and selected “nuclei” as a generalist nucleus segmentation model and “yeast_BF_cp3” as a bright field round object segmentation model [20]. A grid search to find the best post-processing hyperparameters considered diameter ( 17, 30, 40 ) and flow threshold ( 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 ). We used StarDist version 0. 8

. Previous research has shown that neural networks can automatically detect nuclei and other sub-cellular structures in high magnification bright field ( BF ) images [12, 13]. Moreover, U-Net has been suggested as a well-suited model architecture for this purpose, potentially even for low magnification imaging [14–16]

. Only 0. 2 ( s. d. = 0. 5 ) of 50 ground truth nuclei were oversegmented in aiSEGcell segmentations and 0. 2 ( s. d. = 0. 6 ) of 50 nuclei detected in aiSEGcell were merged ground truth nuclei per image on average in D2 ( S4 Table ). Images in D2 were intended for cell tracking and consequently not of high cell density. To evaluate if undersegmentations were more frequent in images dense with cells, we acquired an additional data set ( D7 ) with densely seeded cells

Image segmentation—the partitioning of an image into meaningful segments—is fundamental to image analysis. It is usually the first step in image analysis pipelines to identify tissues, cells, and subcellular structures [1, 2]. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to human bias [3, 4]. Consequently, computer-assisted image segmentation has been widely adopted [5, 6. However, conventional methods require dedicated channels for segmentation [7, 8] or fluorescent labeling [9, 10 ], which are not always available or feasible [11, 12 ]. Here, we introduce aiSEG, a user-friendly software to segment nuclei in bright field images without the need for fluorescent labeling. We demonstrate its utility in challenging conditions, including low magnification and live imaging of primary cells, like hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with large cytoplasmic compartments, and microfluidic devices.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

   . We developed a novel decision-making task, in which participants had to repeatedly learn which of two stimulus features predicted reward. We manipulated the speed of change of the features and asked whether participants were faster to learn when the relevant feature changed slowly versus when it changed quickly. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, as well as extensive model comparison, our results indicate that they do

. Participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predictive feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly, compared to when the opposite was the case. After learning, participants could generalise the learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions. By comparing models with different structures for the learning rates, we showed that participants adjusted their learning to the speed of the features

Causal processes tend to evolve on a slower timescale than noise [31]. To investigate whether humans employ a slowness prior to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning, we tested participants in a decision-making task with stimuli composed of one reward-predictive and one reward-irrelevant feature

We first analysed participant choices to confirm learning of the feature-reward mapping. Participants’ choice accuracy in the learning phase increased from around chance in the first ten trials of a block to significantly above chance in the last ten trials in all three experiment samples ( experiment 1: start = 52%, end = 67%, t ( 49 ) = 8. 27 p <. 001, experiment 2: start = 51%, end = 74%, t ( 49 ) = 13. 26 p <. 001, replication: start = 51%, end = 75%, t ( 137 ) = 26. 91 p <

. Specifically the learning rates for the relevant features mediated the behavioural effect, suggesting that the observed behavioural differences between conditions were being driven by increased learning from the slow feature and decreased learning from the fast feature. Our study extends research on the slowness prior to humans and suggests that it aids learning task states, in a reinforcement learning domain

. In addition, participants might learn a belief about which feature is relevant to determine learning rates [72]. Overall, the results of our experiments suggest that participants were able to learn the values of stimuli better when the relevant feature changed slowly

. These results show that participants learned the feature-reward mapping. We also found that participants could correctly identify the higher value stimulus in the test phase, in which previously unseen feature positions were presented, for which participants never witnessed reward feedback ( mean accuracy significantly higher than the chance level of 50%, experiment 1: 71%, t ( 49 ) = 12. 26 p <. 001; experiment 2: 75%, t ( 49 ) = 17. 38 p <. 001; replication: 75% t ( 137 ) = 32

. Here, we study the role of one such prior in human learning, namely a bias to focus learning on slowly changing features in our environments, and their potential association to rewards. Analogous to the concept of a ‘prior’ in Bayesian statistics, priors are pre-existing beliefs about the underlying structure of an environment, based on generalised past experiences or evolutionary transmission [3, 8]

. The models gradually learn the feature relevance through the feature weights, but the structure of the learning rates anticipates the outcome of this learning process. Nonetheless, the fact that a model with this assumption fits best and participants’ accuracy increased within the first learning trials in a block, lead us to believe that participants quickly developed a sense for the relevance of the features

. In all other aspects, the experiments were identical. The third collected participant sample was a direct replication of experiment 2, with no changes to the task. To analyse trial-by-trial learning, we fit ten computational models to the choices of participants in the learning task. Four learning models embodied alternative hypotheses about how the prior could affect learning and differed in their ability to adapt their learning rates to the slowness of the features

. Our winning model, the four learning rate model, assigned learning rates to the features based on their speed and relevance from the first learning trial of the block. While it is reasonable to assume that participants in experiment 2 and the replication knew the speed of the features based on the preceding observation phase, they could not yet have known which feature was relevant

. We then modelled the expected value Vt of a stimulus as the inner product of the feature vector xt and the weight vector wt: V t = x t T w t ( 2 ) and updated wt after each accept choice to reflect the outcome Rt of trial t with a learning rate α, as follows: w t + 1 = w t + α t x t ( R t - V t ) ( 3 ) To account for exploration behaviour, we modelled participants’ uncertainty, Ut, about the value of a stimulus on trial t using a Kalman Filter

. Our major aim was to test whether the learning process differed depending on whether participants learned about slow or fast-changing features, i. e. in slow vs fast blocks. To this end, we formulated a set of four models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning, as described below ( see Fig 4 )

. Hence, a slowness prior promises a domain-general and biologically plausible way to extract task states from environmental input. Despite its potential for representation learning and the abundance of research in the machine learning domain, studies on the slowness prior in human reinforcement learning are largely lacking. Here we explored the idea that humans rely on a slowness prior during reinforcement learning

. This raises the question of whether the learning improvement for slow features is due to them being easier to learn from, rather than being selectively attended to. For instance, the temporal auto-correlation of features and rewards inherent to a slowly changing environment could enable the use of heuristic strategies, such as a win-stay-lose-shift rule [49, 50]

. Finally, the model’s choice was guided by the probability of the value of accepting, Va, t, being larger than a normal random variable centred on 50 ( the value of rejecting ), with standard deviation σ: p ( accept ) = P [ X ≤ V a, t ] X ∼ N ( 50, σ 2 ) ( 5 ) While all of the four models reported here used the above-described mechanisms, they differed in whether they could adapt their learning rates to the slowness of the features, the relevance of the features to predict reward, or

. Having established that participants learned and generalised well in our task, we turned to our main question, namely, whether reward learning and generalisation differed for slowly versus fast-changing features. All mixed effect models used the maximal random effects structure that converged. We first included all main effects and interactions between predictors in the fixed effects and then tested whether removing them impacted model fit

. One possibility in this regard is that meta-learning, or learning to learn, is the core mechanism that humans use in order to extract regularities of their environment and develop priors that aid perception and learning [65]. While our results align with several theoretical studies on the slowness prior [34, 39, 43], it is important to consider other ways in which slowness can benefit learning. By their nature, slow features are more predictable [35, 36]

. Finally, the fourth model had four separate learning rates for the slow and fast-changing features, when they were relevant and irrelevant ( 4LR model, learning rates αS, R, αF, R vs αS, I, αF, I, respectively ). This model could accommodate both differences in learning due to the slowness of the features and the reward structure of the task, for which reason we expected this model to predict participant choices best

. It follows that a way to extract features relevant to building task states, while remaining impartial to the exact nature of those features or the causal process underlying the perceptual observations, is to focus on slowly changing features. Indeed, some research has shown that humans have a bias toward perceiving slower speeds in the spatial domain [34, 37, 38]

**Title:** Humans Tend to Learn Better When Features Change Slowly, Not Quickly

**Summary:**

Imagine you're playing a game where you need to figure out which of two features of a stimulus predicts a reward. You might think you'd learn faster when the feature changes quickly, but research suggests the opposite. In two experiments, 295 participants learned to predict rewards when a feature changed slowly or quickly. Results showed they learned faster when the feature changed slowly and irrelevant feature quickly, not the other way around. They generalised equally well to new features in both conditions. Models showed participants adjusted learning rates based on feature speed and relevance.

**Key Findings:**

* Participants learned faster when the reward-predict feature changed slowly and irrelevant feature quickly
* Generalised equally well to new features in both conditions
* Models showed participants adjusted learning rates based on feature speed and relevance
* Participants had higher learning rate for slow feature and adjusted to relevance and speed

**What it means:**

Humans tend to learn better when features change slowly, not quickly. This could be because slow features are more predictable, making it easier to use strategies like win-stay-shift rule. This study shows humans use a "slown prior" in learning, a pre-existing belief about environment structure, to aid perception and learning. It's a domain-general and biologically plausible way to extract states from input.

**Implications:**

* Humans use slown prior in reinforcement learning
* Slow features are easier to learn from, not selectively attended
* Temporal-correlation of features and rewards enable heuristic strategies
* Learning and generalisation differ for slow and fast features

**Conclusion:**

Humans tend to learn better when features change slowly, not quickly. This study shows humans use a slown prior in learning, a pre-existing belief about environment, to aid perception and learning. It's a domain and biologically plausible way to extract states from input. Slow features are more predictable, making it easier to use strategies like winay-shift. Learning and generalisation differ for slow and fast features.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Furthermore, an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.

   . Here, we have exploited the genomes of two different strains of mice that exhibit significantly different tumor phenotypes[8] to identify and characterize RESF1 as a novel tumor suppressor for ER- breast cancer. Previous genetic analysis of an [FVB/NJ ( MOLF/EiJ x PyMT ) ]N2 backcross mapping population revealed an association of 5 genes whose expression correlated with the metastatic burden on the distal end of mouse chromosome 6

. Expression analysis in the human breast cancer METABRIC data set and in the autochthonous PyMT x MOLF/EiJ backcross tumor samples indicated that lower expression of Resf1 was associated with worse outcomes. This interpretation was supported by the experimental cross between the Resf1 gene trap and the PyMT mouse, where animals with reduced Resf1 expression had higher incidence of metastatic disease and increased numbers of pulmonary metastases

. In this study, we expand upon these previous findings and provide evidence that an additional gene within this interval, Retroviral silencing factor 1 ( Resf1 ), is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer.

. The remaining 2 candidate genes in the genetically defined region, Fgfr1op2, and Slco1a5, have not yet been evaluated for their role in metastatic disease. As described above, Resf1 is a poorly characterized gene, producing a 1521 amino acid product that is encoded primarily by a single exon

. The Resf1 KO mouse was bred to the PyMT model to compare the tumor phenotypes of PyMT+/Resf1wt/wt and PyMT+/Resf1wt/KO compound heterozygous animals. Consistent with the gene trap model, the reduction of Resf1 by CRISPR-mediated deletion was associated with increased tumor burden, more rapid tumor growth, and an increase in the number of pulmonary metastases ( S3A–S3D Fig )

. To validate Resf1 as a metastasis modifier and to determine its disease phenotype in vivo, a Resf1 genetically engineered mouse model ( GEMM ) generated by an enhancer/gene trap insertion was used. The C57BL/6-Et ( EGFP/Cre ) 16255Rdav mouse model ( hereafter, the gene trap model ) was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers

. The association of RESF1 with cardiovascular disease was identified in an exome-wide association study of 1, 482 patients with cardiovascular disease and 5, 774 healthy controls. Neither study, however, included any mechanistic analysis of this gene, so the potential overlap of these phenotypes with a role in breast cancer metastasis is currently unknown

. Depletion of RESF1 results in increased tumor growth and metastasis, potentially through suppression of the EMT pathway. RESF1 is enriched on exons of actively transcribed genes that contain 1 or more predicted DNA G4 quadruplex on both the template and non-template strand, implying an important role in transcriptional elongation. However, the precise mechanism by which RESF1 alters metastatic potential remains unclear at present

. Since disordered protein domains are thought to be stabilized by post-translational modifications or interactions with binding partners [33] [34], RESF1’s secondary or tertiary structure may be more critical to protein function than the primary sequence. Further analysis will be required to investigate the validity of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, attempts to validate Resf1 specifically as a metastasis susceptibility gene revealed conflicting results

. Because this gene-trap animal has not been extensively characterized and single-gene tumor expression studies can be confounded by amplifications or deletions that include additional genes that might influence the phenotype, we incorporated a second CRISPR-mediated Resf1 KO animal into the study. Breeding this animal to the PyMT tumor model replicated the results from the gene trap experiment and the mouse and tumor Resf1 gene expression prognosis analysis

. Intriguingly, our RNA-seq data suggest potential opposing roles at different sites, with higher Resf1 expression levels in metastases compared to primary tumors in FVB/PyMT mice. These opposing roles at the primary and secondary sites are similar to what is seen for TGFβ, which can be either a tumor suppressor or metastasis-enhancing molecule [37]

. Moreover, genotyping analysis of matched tail and primary tumor samples from PyMT+/Resf1wt/wt and PyMT+/Resf1wt/KO F1 mice showed the loss of the wildtype allele in many of the animals ( S3I Fig ), supporting the role of Resf1 as a tumor suppressor. This is consistent with previous studies that suggest that Resf1 is a rare tumor suppressor gene [18]

. This approach utilizes polymorphic, rather than somatically altered, sequences as the genomic “flag post. ” To capture the effects of human diversity and the underlying causes of metastatic breast cancer, our laboratory employs a mouse systems genetics approach. The FVB/NJ-TgN ( MMTV-PyMT ) 634Mul ( hereafter, MMTV-PyMT ) mouse model is a highly metastatic and frequently used model of human breast cancer

. This model was generated by lentiviral gene trap construct integration into the first exon of Resf1, resulting in the expression of an EGFP-cre fusion and the truncation of the Resf1 message ( www. mmrrc. org/catalog/sds. php? mmrrc_id=34574 ). qRT-PCR analysis of mammary tumor tissue from wildtype and gene trap x FVB/MMTV-PyMT littermates confirmed a reduction of Resf1 mRNA ( Fig 3A )

. Thus, the in vivo suppression of the EMT transcriptional program in the Resf1 depleted autochthonous tumors is consistent with the increased tumor growth and decreased tumor latency. The precise mechanism for this phenomenon, however, has yet to be determined. In summary, here we present evidence that RESF1 is a chromatin-associated nucleoplasmic protein that functions as a tumor suppressor in ER- breast cancers

. Examination of the Kaplan-Meier ( KM ) plots for DMFS in the mouse data revealed the greatest stratification for survival for Arntl2, Resf1, and Etfbkmt ( S1 Fig ), which were selected for further analysis. The validation and characterization of the role of Arntl2 in breast cancer metastasis was previously described by our group [8]. The potential role of Resf1 in breast cancer metastasis is discussed here

. In contrast, RNA-seq analysis of matched FVB-PyMT tumors and metastases demonstrated higher Resf1 expression in metastases, which suggests a potential pro-metastatic role at the secondary site ( S3J Fig ). Combined, these data suggest a complex dual role of Resf1 in tumor progression analogous to TGFβ, with functions as a tumor suppressor in the primary tumor but metastatic promoting abilities in the secondary site

. To determine if the metastatic mechanism of RESF1 is immune-related, we performed orthotopic fat pad assays in nu/nu mice. As described above, shRNA suppression of RESF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells implanted into nude mice significantly reduced metastatic disease

. Finally, while RNA-seq analysis revealed relatively modest transcriptional effects upon RESF1 depletion, the in vivo expression data pointed towards the suppression of EMT-associated pathways following RESF1 loss ( summarized in Table 1 ). Current thought suggests that breast cancer cells that acquire mesenchymal transcription patterns are non-proliferative and that cells must revert to a more epithelial state prior to expansion

. 36%, p = 0. 05, Fisher’s exact test; Fig 3E ), consistent with the poor survival observed in human patients with lower RESF1 expression. The role of RESF1 in metastatic disease was further explored by using orthotopic transplants for spontaneous metastasis assays. We attempted to knockdown RES1 in MDA-MB-231 cells using shRNA and implanted them into nu/nu mice, which resulted in a significant reduction of metastatic disease ( Fig 3E )

    Title: 
    Abstract: During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. At single loci, loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. Here, we utilise two strategies—deletion of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor—to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. In line with previous studies, we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24—driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs—rare in wild-type cells—occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference. Such effects are similar to, but less extreme than, the phenotype of ‘ZMM’ mutants such as zip3Δ, and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. Collectively, in addition to shared roles in CO regulation, our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR. 

    Supporting Text:
    We report here the impact that loss of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 has on many aspects of meiotic recombination ( Fig 9 ). Rad24 is known to be important for activating Mec1 via its role in loading the 9-1-1 clamp in response to ssDNA produced by the resection of DSBs [2]. Thus, as examined here, it is not surprising that in some aspects of meiotic recombination the effects of rad24Δ are similar to those of mec1-mn

. To further establish the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic recombination, and to determine whether previously inferred roles can be extended genome-wide, we mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in rad24Δ and mec1-mn ( ’meiotic null’ ) backgrounds, revealing both similar and distinct roles for Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic DSB repair.

. In wild-type SK1 cells, normal prophase I length is ~3–4 hours, with prophase exit coordinated with meiotic DSB repair via decreases in Mec1-dependent activation of Mek1 [12, 13, 46]. Spore viability was increased by use of the ndt80AR system in both rad24Δ and mec1-mn mutants ( Fig 1C ) and was proportional to the length of time held in prophase ( S2B Fig )

. Although the degree of Mec1 depletion cannot be assessed in the individual meiotic cells in which we characterise meiotic recombination outcomes, we expect Mec1 protein to be substantially depleted during meiotic prophase. Accurate determination of recombination patterns by tetrad or octad sequencing requires all spores to survive, hampering the analysis of genotypes with low spore viability ( i. e. mutants such as mec1 and rad24 that perturb recombination and chromosome segregation )

. In plants, both RAD1 and HUS1 promote accurate DSB repair during meiosis, in particular suppressing nonhomologous end-joining [100] and ZMM-independent CO formation between heterologues [101]. Due to the interplay between various aspects of meiotic recombination regulation, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain which, if any, of these defects are distinct from a generalised abrogation of ATR function

. By sensing ongoing recombination activity and unrepaired DSBs [10, 11], Mec1 acts as a molecular rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek1 kinase, a paralogue of Rad53 ( CHK2 in mammals ) that regulates the activity of Ndt80 [12, 13], the transcription factor required for exit from meiotic prophase [14, 15]

Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid cells for sexual reproduction. Integral to meiosis is the process of genetic recombination, which is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks catalysed by the topoisomerase II-like enzyme, Spo11 [1]. Meiotic recombination is monitored by the DNA damage response ( DDR ) in a similar manner to DNA lesions arising within vegetative cells, likely due to the potentially dangerous nature of DSBs

. Firstly, we investigated the impact of deleting SML1 ( Suppressor of Mec1 Lethality 1 ), an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase that is normally inactivated by Mec1 in response to DNA damage, thereby increasing dNTP pool levels—promoting genetic fidelity and cell viability [44]. Sml1 is not known to have any role in meiosis, nor to affect the viability of a rad24Δ mutant. Nevertheless, we found that sml1Δ increased the spore viability of rad24Δ hybrids ~7 fold ( to 4

. cerevisiae meiosis. Current observations in other organisms suggest relatively conserved roles for ATRMec1 during meiosis ( Introduction ) —consistent with the coordination between meiotic DNA repair and meiotic chromosome segregation that is essential for fertility. However, there has been relatively little analysis of the roles of the checkpoint clamp and loader during meiosis outside of S. cerevisiae

. Despite a similar checkpoint defect as rad24Δ, we infer that mec1-mn strains survive more readily than rad24Δ due to a derepression of DSB formation. As indicated above, we recognise that a potential limitation of whole genome recombination assays is the requirement for meioses generating four viable spores, leading to potential selection bias within analysed data

. The effects of msh2Δ are likely to be due to a combination of the increased visibility of NCOs in the absence of mismatch restoration, the loss of mechanisms that inhibit recombination at sites of polymorphism in mismatch repair-proficient ( MSH2+ ) strains, and the direct role that Msh2 plays during recombination-intermediate metabolism during meiosis [49, 51, 52] Whilst no further increase in recombination was observed in the ndt80AR msh2Δ double strain ( ndt80AR P = 0

. Thus, artificially extending prophase ( and/or preventing the early Ndt80 expression that may arise in DDR mutants [14, 15] ) may provide more time for DDR mutants to undergo and/or complete the productive HR reactions necessary for accurate chromosome segregation at meiosis I [16]. Whilst extension of prophase significantly improved spore viability of mec1 and rad24 mutants, it did not greatly impact wild-type spore viability ( Fig 1B )

. In the generalised pathway, DNA damage leads to the activation of Tel1ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated ) and Mec1ATR ( Rad3-related ) checkpoint kinases ( Human orthologues are indicated with superscript text ), via the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1-complex and Rad24RAD17 ( reviewed in [2] ). Rad24RAD17 is the loader of the Ddc1RAD9-Rad17RAD1-Mec3HUS1 ( “9-1-1” ) checkpoint clamp, that binds to the ssDNA/dsDNA junctions that arise following resection of DNA ends [3]

. Supporting this view, loss of Zip3 function had a largely dissimilar phenotype to both rad24Δ and mec1-mn, suggesting that the primary defect in either DDR mutant is not loss of ZMM loading, but more likely a combined effect of this defect and loss of the meiotic prophase checkpoint

. In S. cerevisiae meiosis, similar to the vegetative DDR pathway, the 9-1-1 clamp complex, its loader Rad24, and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex act as damage sensors [9], with ssDNA, produced by the resection of Spo11-DSBs, activating Mec1 [10]

. Alternatively or additionally, the effect on resection may be because Rad24 and Rad17 are involved in activating Mec1, which may then prevent resection by deactivation of Exo1 [86]. In vegetative cells, the 9-1-1 complex inhibits resection by promoting the recruitment of Rad9 near DSBs [87]; however, this may not be the case for meiotic DSBs, because Rad9 is not required for checkpoint activation in meiosis [10]

. Conversely, ATR can localize to meiotic DSBs in the absence of Rad9 [10], suggesting that the 9-1 clamp may not be required for Mec1 activation in meiosis. However, the role of Rad24 in loading the 9-1 clamp in meiosis is supported by the fact that rad24 mutants exhibit similar defects in meiotic recombination as mec1n, which is consistent with the role of Rad24 in loading the 9-1 clamp in vegetative cells [2]
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico-scale metabolic model of Pneumocyst jirovec, a deadly pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder its growth in vitro. The model was developed using published genome data, literature, and bioinformatics tools, and validated with Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement approaches to predict metabolic fluxes and critical components of Pneumyst growth. Findings offer insights into the biology of Pneumyst and provide a strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing the pathogen in vitro. A genome-scale model was also developed for the mouse-specific pathogen Pocyst murina to enable experimental comparisons with in murine models of infection. The model was validated with in vitro culture conditions designed by Meral et al, which support Pyst growth, and extended with Flux Balance Analysis to make predictions regarding metabolic flux and identify critical components of Pyst growth. The model can replicate drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in developing antifungal targets.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available.

   . This study investigated whether an increase in YAP/TAZ levels is sufficient to induce sustained chronic cancer proliferation. We conducted cell proliferation simulations using a 3D model that considered cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions to achieve such investigations based on reaction networks representing normal and cancerous tissues. We combined MD models with a reaction network model of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ

. However, it remains uncertain whether this increase in YAP/TAZ expression can override the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and maintain cell growth. We developed a computational model using MD simulations to investigate this type of chronic proliferation maintenance. This model mimics cell interactions driven by external factors such as adhesion, repulsion, and friction

In this study, we performed 3D multicellular simulations combining MD methods with reaction network models of the Hippo pathway, which is known to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity. Our approach effectively simulated cell division and growth, preventing cell overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with LJ ( 12–6 ) potential with a softcore character, and integrating cell cycle dynamics, particularly the M and G1 phases

. This model, integrating cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics, provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of both cell density and YAP/TAZ concentration on proliferation, contributing to our understanding of the proliferative characteristics of normal and cancer cells

. These findings suggest that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass contact inhibition under high-density conditions, contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. Our model’s integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics could position it as a tool for evaluating cancer malignancy, exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ, and optimizing drug dosages.

. Our approach uniquely integrates the Hippo pathway signaling dynamics with cell-cell interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we calculated 3D spatiotemporal patterns of normal and cancerous tissues, including cell survival or cell cycle arrest

. This study focuses on a model that integrates cell dynamics, which affect cell density, and intra-cellular dynamics, which influence YAP/TAZ levels. Our goal was to understand how increased YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells affect their proliferation under high-density conditions. Using this model, we monitored the changes in nuclear YAP levels ( X2i ) over time in normal tissues

. To investigate whether the elevated levels of YAP/TAZ observed in cancer tissues are sufficient to sustain chronic proliferation, we developed models representing time evolutions of normal and cancerous tissues. Our 3D simulations revealed that while normal tissues exhibited cell cycle arrest and suppression of exponential growth, cancer tissues with YAP/TAZ levels twice as high demonstrated continuous exponential proliferation

. We also solved the equations of motion of cells that undergo repeated growth and division and obtained temporal evolutions of the positions of multicellular cells. By integrating the molecular signaling of the Hippo pathway with cell mechanics and cell cycle dynamics, our study offers new insights into the mechanisms driving cancer proliferation and presents a newly and more dynamic model compared to previous research.

. We introduced a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, reflecting cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway simulation. This innovation allowed us to simulate cell proliferation as an output response, providing a more detailed and dynamic representation of how intracellular signaling modulates cell division decisions

We explored the effects of increased YAP/TAZ levels on cell proliferation in cancer cells. YAP/TAZ play a role in the cell nucleus and are restrained by the activated Hippo pathway under high-density conditions, causing them to be retained in the cytoplasm and ultimately stopping cell growth. Many cancer cells have significantly higher YAP/TAZ expression compared to normal cells [12, 22, 23]

. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. In addition to the standard MD model, we introduce the cell cycle as a factor to reflect the dynamics of life in this model

. Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Consequently, the YAP/TAZ-induced expression of cell proliferation-related genes is inhibited [5–10]. YAP and TAZ are major effectors of the Hippo pathway and are considered proto-oncoproteins involved in cancer tissue proliferation, stemness, metastasis, and drug resistance [11–13]

. Remarkably, cancer cells with merely a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels exhibit almost no growth inhibition and continue to increase exponentially. This suggests that cancer cells with elevated YAP/TAZ levels bypass typical proliferative checks, underscoring the pivotal role of YAP/TAZ in regulating cellular proliferation dynamics in oncogenic contexts. The ratio of X2 between cancer and normal cells ( C/N_X2mean ) exhibits a temporal evolution in Fig 8

. However, these studies often did not directly address the intricate molecular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and their interactions with mechanical forces at the multicellular level. Additionally, previous models did not incorporate the dynamic feedback mechanisms of the Hippo pathway on cell proliferation and survival, especially under high cell density conditions

. By solving the kinetic differential equations using the Verlet method S2 Appendix, we calculated the time evolutions of the cell positions r i k and velocities v i k, i = 1, ⋯, Nk, k = 0, ⋯, L. In this section, we construct a model of reaction network of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway [40] in Fig 3 an example. The corresponding reaction equations are given by Eqs ( 3a ), ( 3b ) and ( 3c )

. Indeed, in various cancers, increased YAP/TAZ levels have been observed because of mutations in MST1/2 and LATS1/2 as well as gene amplification of YAP1 and WWTR1, which encode YAP and TAZ [14–21]. However, the precise extent of YAP/TAZ protein upregulation in cancer tissues is several-fold higher than that in normal tissues [12, 22, 23], and measures to evade cell cycle arrest under high-density conditions and trigger sustained chronic proliferation [24] remains poorly understood

. Under low-density conditions, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive, allowing co-activators Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) to interact with transcription factors, such as TEAD1-4, in the nucleus, thereby inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, MST1/2 is activated first under high-density conditions, leading to the phosphorylation of LATS1/2

. The basis for choosing this time point to draw conclusions is the nature of cancer cells, specifically as a model demonstrating exponential cell growth. As shown in Fig 4B, in cancer tissues, X2i rarely fell below Xth even after 200 h. Thus, a two-fold increase in Y/TA is sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest and sustain proliferation under high-density conditions. Our results suggest that increased levels of Y/TA alone are sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and maintain cell growth.
Researchers have developed an energy framework, called the Free Landscape of Stickers (ELS), to study how low-complexity domains (LCD) in proteins influence the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens. ELS uses a continuous "stickiness" scale to investigate the effects of LCD patterns on condens dynamics and material properties. By varying the complexity of sequences, they found that periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. The framework explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity through periodicity variations. The study reveals that minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condens, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. ELS provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded material properties, where features of landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. The research addresses the role of complexity in governing dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens, advancing understanding their functions and roles.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question. Using the mouse dentition as a model, we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh. Together, our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Future studies will determine the precise role of cell-cell adhesion and the relative contribution by adherence junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes in regulating cellular rearrangement during these processes. In the mouse molar placode, Shh is required for the narrowing of the dental epithelium at the neck region and for proper invagination [10, 45]. Here, we show that Shh signaling does so in part through promotion of MyoII activity

. Results from these experiments thus support a model, in which Shh signals through PI3K/AKT and MyoII in the tooth epithelium to maintain proper cell-cell adhesion and to promote convergent cell movement that drives epithelial invagination.

. It does so by strengthening cell-cell adhesion at adherens junctions and by enabling efficient and persistent convergent cell movement in the suprabasal layer, where cells at the periphery of the tooth bud move towards the midline. Finally, we uncovered that Shh signaling acts through PI3K/AKT to activate MyoII. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis thus promotes proper cell-cell adhesion and cell movement to propel incisor invagination.

. As myosin II acts at multiple levels to both generate cellular forces and maintain robust intercellular adhesion, their perturbations are compounded in the MyoII mutants, readily impeding the convergent extension-driven narrowing of the dental cord and ultimately the invagination itself

. Our results thus demonstrate the importance of MyoII in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium. This is also consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and the growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells [67, 68], and deletion of myosin IIA and/or IIB results in mislocalized E-cadherin and defective adhesion in mouse embryos [34, 69]

. Together, our findings here show that Shh can signal through PI3K/AKT to activate MyoII and drive dental epithelial invagination. We next asked if Shh functions through MyoII to promote cell adhesion and convergent movement. Akin to the Myh9/10epi-cko mutants, cyclopamine-treated incisors displayed reduced ECCD2 and β-catenin expression ( Fig 7A–7B’, 7E, 7F–7G’, 7J )

. Interestingly, genetic mutations in regulators that function upstream to control actomyosin activity, including GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) and small Rho GTPases, have been recently linked to dental anomalies in humans [25–29]. However, whether MyoII is required in the epithelium to control its invagination and shape is not understood, and how its activity may be integrated with upstream biochemical signals during tooth development is also to be addressed

. Inhibition of Shh signaling perturbs both invagination and cell-cell adhesion, which are also observed in MyoII mutant incisors and can be rescued upon forced MyoII activation. Based on these data, we propose that Shh signaling from the initiation knot controls early tooth development by activating MyoII in the tooth bud, which in turn promotes cell-cell adhesion and persistent cell movement to drive convergent extension and invagination of the incisor epithelium

. 0 and E14. 0 showed that the expression of IIA and IIB were decreased in the Myh9/10mes-cko mutant mesenchyme ( S2N–S2S Fig ). Yet both control and Myh9/10mes-cko incisor epithelia invaginated similarly ( S2T Fig ). While this result may be due to perdured IIB expression in some mesenchymal cells ( S2P Fig ), comparisons of the Myh9/10epi-cko and Myh9/10mes-cko mutants indicate that the tissue-autonomous function of epithelial MyoII is critical for proper tooth formation

. Together, these results indicate that MyoII is dispensable for maintaining proper signaling center formation and dental epithelial proliferation, and the invagination phenotype is not due to perturbations or a delayed onset in these developmental events. Because earlier reports have shown that defective cell-cell adhesion could cause cystic changes during odontogenesis [30, 31], we next tested if cell-cell adhesion was affected in the absence of MyoII activity

. However, the underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms involved in epithelial invagination are still poorly understood. The mouse tooth has long served as a model for understanding epithelial morphogenesis [5]. Beginning at embryonic day 11 ( E11 ), the dental placode emerges as a thickened stripe across the oral surface, marking the earliest morphological sign of tooth formation [6, 7]

. In the absence of MyoII, cells moved more randomly, and the epithelium could not efficiently narrow to drive invagination. Finally, we also noticed that as control tooth germs invaginated, suprabasal cells became aligned around the forming enamel knot at E13. 5. However, Myh9/10epi-cko cells are more disorganized and showed reduced coherency in cell orientations ( S7 Fig ). MyoII is therefore critical for organized cellular movement and arrangement during epithelial invagination

. In this study, we investigate the functional requirement of MyoII in controlling the dynamic cellular organization in the developing mouse incisor bud. By combining explant culture and in vivo genetic studies, we found that MyoII is essential for tooth development and epithelial invagination

. We next investigated the upstream signal that activates MyoII activity in the invaginating incisor. Between E12. 5 and E13. 5, Shh is a key signaling molecule expressed in the initiation knot signaling center of the developing tooth, and Hedgehog signaling activity can be readily detected in the entire dental epithelium, as assessed using the expression of its target gene Ptch1 ( Fig 6A ) [42–44]

. 5 and observed the same phenotypes ( S3 Fig ). MyoII proteins are thus required tissue-autonomously within the dental epithelium to maintain its integrity as well as to drive the morphological appearance of the dental cord and to enable effective invagination

. One possible explanation is that perduring myosin IIA/B proteins following Cre-recombination of Myh9/10 are sufficient to maintain cell motility. Alternatively, other myosin motor proteins can compensate and sustain motility [71]. It is important to note, however, that loss of cell-cell adhesion alone in certain contexts does not appear to affect dental cord narrowing and invagination

. It was thus postulated that such a convergent cell movement generates the planar tissue tension observed in the suprabasal layer and is required during dental epithelial invagination to direct the downward bending and growth of the placode towards the mesenchyme [15]. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that enables cell rearrangement and coordinates the collective directional movement to propel invagination is not clear

. 5. Through genetic studies in both mice and humans, we now know that many transcription factors and components of signaling pathways play critical roles during tooth development [8], but how they modulate cell behaviors to control morphogenesis is only beginning to be understood. Several recent studies have unveiled the well-coordinated patterns of cell proliferation and movement during the multi-step process of molar epithelial invagination

. Because both myosin IIA and IIB are also expressed in the dental mesenchyme during epithelial invagination, we next generated Msx1CreER;R26mT/mG;Myh9/10f/f embryos ( Myh9/10mes-cko ( mesenchymal conditional knockouts ) ) to test if mesenchymal deletion of IIA and IIB would impact the invagination of the dental epithelium ( S2G Fig ). Examining the incisor tooth germs at both E13. 0 and E14

. In all instances, the activation of MyoII or AKT was able to rescue the invagination defect caused by Shh inhibition, as the rescued epithelial tissues exhibited a similar depth and width-to-depth ratio as the control samples ( Figs 6M and 6N and S9M, S9N ). We also performed MyoII rescue in older tooth germs using AKT activation ( S Fig 6O, S6’O ) and found that the epithelium invaginated similarly to control samples ( S Fig 6P, 6’P ). These results indicate that MyII is necessary for epithelial invagination and that Sh signaling through PIK/AKT activates MyII to promote cell adhesion and convergent cell movement in the supasal layer of the dental epithelium

Our results suggest that Sh signaling through PIK/AKT activates MyII to promote cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movement in the supasal layer of the dental epithelium during invagination, and that MyII is necessary for epithelial invagination.
Researchers have developed a deep learning model called single-cell graph convolutional network (scGCN) to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scAC-se) data. The model, scGC, addresses the challenge of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity between datasets by leveraging transfer learning from scRNA-se to scAC-se as a domain adaptation problem in transfer learning. scGC uses a multistage learning strategy to integrate gene and chromatin data into a unified multiomics cell atlas, achieving hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. The model formulates cell-cell relationships and gene expression with convolution network based on kinetic relationships between regulatory mechanisms of sc-se and scAC. It explores the idea of MKMD-based adaptation for transferable features in embeddings of sc-se and scAC, enabling the model to leverage domain-specific effects. Multiple kernels adapt representations enhance effectiveness between embeddings of sc-se and scAC. scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as sc-se and scAC. The framework is an end-to-end and hypothesis-free for integrating single-cell multiomics with high accuracy and robustness, combining omics autoencoders with convolution networks and learning. It integrates different omics data with different distributions. Compared to Seurat, Conos, scJoint, and GL, label results demonstrate scGC as an effective tool for large-cell datasets, providing insights into biological systems at single-cell level. The model focuses on cell classification, but can be used for other tasks like trajectory, cell interaction, and time-series analysis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling, we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which, despite lacking a single consensus sequence, retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen.

   . Further characterization of Mcm3’s NLS will not only help elucidate its cell cycle dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins. Since the nuclear import of Mcm3 and its subsequent chromatin loading are essential for cell growth [8, 9], we performed mutagenesis studies to identify specific basic residues within Mcm3’s NLS that are critical for its function

. In contrast, P4 is often occupied by a non-basic residue in monopartite NLSs [5, 7]; structural studies of the SV40 and c-Myc NLSs suggest that P4 does not interact specifically with importin alpha, thus P4 may be less critical for nuclear import [4, 15]. In support of the essential role of P2 and P3 mediated interactions, mutations of Mcm3 at P2 or P3 result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth

. Thus, further biophysical studies, including measurements of binding affinity between Mcm3’s NLS and Kap60, are needed to characterize various mcm3 mutations and gain a deeper understanding of their effects on nuclear import. An unexpected finding from our study is that the Mcm3SV40-NLS-allR mutant fails to support nuclear import of Mcm3 ( Figs 3 and 4 ), despite AF3 predicting similar contacts with Kap60 at P2 and P3 ( S7 Fig )

. This is supported by the constitutive nuclear localization signal observed in both full-length and C-terminal fragments of Mcm3 lacking this NES ( Mcm3Δ781-884 ) ( S4A and S4B Fig ). Defective import of Mcm3 into the cell nucleus may compromise MCM loading in cells, leading to severe growth defects ( Figs 1 and 2 ). To test this hypothesis, we examined the chromatin association of MCM in cells arrested in the G1 or the G2/M phase ( Fig 5A ) [39, 40]

AF3 is the latest tool capable of predicting protein-protein interactions [43]. Here, we utilized this tool to model the interaction between importin alpha and Mcm3’s NLS variants. Our analysis demonstrates that the NLSs of Mcm3 and SV40 share similar contacts with Kap60 ( Figs 6A, 6B and S7B )

. This conservation suggests that Mcm3764-771 is likely crucial for nuclear import, though sequences flanking this conserved region may also be necessary for optimal NLS activity. To evaluate this, we examined the effects of various mcm3 truncation mutants on cell growth via plasmid shuffling ( Fig 1B )

. In addition to the sequence similarity, several lines of evidence suggest that this sequence acts as a functional NLS for Mcm3. First, the SV40 NLS was shown to functionally substitute for Mcm3757-779, providing strong support for the role of this Mcm3 fragment in controlling nuclear import [8, 9]. Second, fusion of Mcm3755-781 with galactosidase was sufficient to direct its nuclear localization [9]

. Together, these findings suggest that mutations within the conserved motif of Mcm3’s NLS disrupt its nuclear localization, leading to the observed growth defects of these mutants. As previously reported, the absence of Mcm3 in the cell nucleus during the G2/M phase could be attributed to a leucine-rich nuclear export signal ( NES ) motif ( Mcm3834-842 ) [8]

. To understand the effects of these mutations, we used AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) to model the binding between Mcm3’s NLS and Kap60, the importin alpha in yeast [4, 25].

. This study provides additional support of the importance of K767 and K768 in Mcm3, which are critical for both its nuclear import through interaction with Kap60 and loading onto chromatin through modification by SUMO [41]. The defects of growth-impaired mcm3 mutants in nuclear import and chromatin association are considered a loss-of-function

The nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ), a short motif rich in basic amino acids, controls the import of many nuclear proteins [1–13]. Two types of NLS have been identified: monopartite and bipartite [1–3, 11–13]. A monopartite NLS consists of a single, continuous stretch of basic amino acids, including lysine and arginine [1–3, 11, 13]

. For example, variants of Mcm3’s NLS such as Mcm3R771A ( 764KSPKKRQAV772 ) can still localize to the nucleus, as indicated by their normal cell growth ( Fig 1 ). Similarly, other NLSs, such as that from V-Jun ( KSRKRVL ), also deviate from this proposed consensus sequence [1, 6, 45]. Instead, we propose that AF3 offers a new approach to evaluate monopartite NLSs

. Third, fluorescence microscopy of a GFP-tagged, shorter fragment of Mcm3766-772 resulted in a modest nuclear localization signal in live cells [8], suggesting that the flanking sequences of this Mcm3 NLS are needed for optimal NLS activity. Despite these findings, the sequence specificity of Mcm3’s NLS remains to be determined

. In agreement with previous studies [9, 31–34], both wild-type ( WT ) GFP-Mcm3 and GFP-Mcm3 with the SV40 NLS substitution localize to the nucleus during G1 but not the G2/M phase ( Fig 3A and 3B ). In contrast, Mcm3K767R, K768R, Mcm3SV40-NLS-allR and other growth-impaired mutants with mutations in Mcm3764-771 do not localize to nucleus in both G1 and G2/M phases ( Figs 3 and S2 )

. Although these NLSs, like the SV40 NLS, are rich in basic residues, sequence variations among them raise questions about whether they interact with importin alpha in a similar manner [4, 15]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm3, a subunit of the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance ( MCM ) complex [21–24], has a monopartite NLS ( 764KSPKKRQRV772 ) that resembles the SV40 NLS but has yet-to-be fully characterized [8, 9]

. Both monopartite and bipartite NLSs function by interacting with proteins in the importin family, which are key transport receptors that recognize and guide NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus [1, 14]

. In each sample, wild-type GFP-Mcm3 displays robust chromatin association among the cells analyzed. By comparison, all growth-impaired mcm3 mutants exhibit a significantly reduced amount of chromatin-bound Mcm3. We considered that these mcm3 mutants could affect the formation of MCM complex, leading to the observed defective chromatin loading. To test this, we examined the ability of these mcm3 mutants to be loaded on DNA in vitro

. Notably, the nuclear signal of the Mcm3 fragment with the SV40 NLS substitution appears to have greater intensity compared to that of the native Mcm3 fragment, which has a modest yet detectable nuclear signal ( Fig 4A and 4B ). In contrast, all growth-impaired GFP-Mcm3 mutant fragments with mutations in Mcm3764-771 do not localize to the nucleus in both G1 and M phases ( Figs 4B and S3 )

. In contrast, mutation of a nearby basic residue in the SV40 NLS ( Lys-131 ) to methionine did not significantly affect nuclear import [20], suggesting that specific basic residues within the SV40 NLS may play distinct roles in controlling nuclear import. In addition to the SV40 NLS, other monopartite NLSs have been identified, including those in H2B, v-Jun, and various others proteins [1–10, 13]

. This is further supported by the finding that the amount of chromatin-bound MCM in G1 cells is reduced by m3 mutants ( Figs 5 and 6 ), suggesting that Mc3’s nuclear localization is necessary for MCM loading and cell growth.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Across species, Ataxin-2 has three conserved regions: a Like-Sm ( LSm ) domain, an LSm-associated domain ( LSm-AD ) and a PAM2 motif, which is flanked by extended IDRs [82]. Detailed work in Drosophila has shown that a c-terminal IDR of Atx2 is selectively required for mRNP assembly into granules [61]

. We now present a series of experiments further elaborating mechanisms by which Ataxin-2 functions in mRNA translation and mRNP assembly. These show that the PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit Atx2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules

Some RNA-binding proteins can remain associated with mRNAs across multiple stages: RNA processing, transport, translation, or translational control [2, 95–99]. Ataxin-2 may be one such protein. It is a translational activator of the Drosophila period mRNA, a repressor of several miRNA reporters, a facilitator of neuronal mRNP-granule and stress-granule formation as well as a broad stabilizer of Ataxin-2 associated mRNAs [61, 92, 100–105]

. Our previous work showed that atx2 mutants lacking the cIDR required for Ataxin-2 granule formation in Drosophila neurons and S2 cells, were resistant to neurodegeneration as assessed in Drosophila disease models [61, 74]. We further showed that the LSm-domain antagonizes Ataxin-2 granule formation [83]

. We therefore tested whether the third conserved region of Ataxin-2, a PAM2 motif known to associate with PABP ( polyA binding protein ), played any role in this process [85, 86]. We used Gal80ts-controlled elav-Gal4 to express Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd ( deleted for the PAM2 motif ) in brains of adult Drosophila for 5 days and used RNA-Seq to identify edited RNAs in polyA selected brain RNA and compared it with Atx2-ADARcd using procedures described earlier ( Fig 1A ) [87]

. When taken together with other findings [73, 82–84], our observations indicate that PAM2 binding to PABP on the polyA tail of mRNAs helps specify the composition of Ataxin-2 granules. We propose an early role for PAM2:PABP interactions working in coordination with the LSm domain to support mRNA translation and thereby oppose the mRNP formation [82]; as well as a later role in escorting translationally-stalled PAM2:PABP linked mRNAs into mRNP granules

. Our work now identifies the interactions between Ataxin-2’s PAM2 motif and PABP as a critical contributor to the assembly of Ataxin-2 containing mRNP granules. This suggests a mechanism by which the multiple interactions helps select mRNA and protein components of mRNP granules ( Fig 6 ). We suggest that Ataxin-2, guided by PAM2:PABP interactions and LSm domain interactions, recruits target mRNAs and associated proteins into translating mRNPs [84]

. Second, Atx2-associated mRNA may move into mRNP granules whose formation is facilitated by Atx2 IDR-mediated condensation. We postulate that mRNAs in such assemblies are stored in a form that is protected from degradation. Although such a model aligns with our data, we recognize the absence of experimental evidence in the current study and acknowledge the necessity for extensive and rigorous testing within the life cycle of a single Ataxin-2 target mRNA

A recent work from our lab used Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ) technology to identify mRNAs associated with Atx2 in the Drosophila adult brain [83]. In vivo, the ability of an Atx2-fusion with ADARcd ( the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme, ADAR ), to edit a group of 256 target mRNAs was found to be dependent on the presence of the Atx2-cIDR, previously shown to be necessary for the formation of neuronal mRNP granules in vivo

. Instead, the TRIBE data address how Atx2-target mRNAs are selected into neuronal mRNP granules that exist in non-stressed cells in vivo, and microscopic studies analyse protein components of mRNP granules formed following Atx2 expression in S2 cells. Our experiments and observations therefore point to fundamental differences in mechanisms by which the assembly of neuronal granules, or granule types found in unstressed cells, may differ from those involved in stress-granule assembly

. Thus, while granule assembly requires the IDRs of Ataxin-2, association of the protein with mRNP-granule components may be achieved by structured domain interactions alone, independently of mRNP assembly into granules. Further experiments examined which of the LSm, LSm-AD and/or PAM2 domains were necessary for mini-Ataxin-2 to associate with SGs. Mammalian and Drosophila mini-Ataxin-2 forms missing the LSm or LSm-AD domains could still be found in SGs ( Fig 4B, 4C, 4I, and 4J )

. Our observation that PABP co-immunoprecipitates with mini-Ataxin2, show that Atx2PAM2:PABP interactions occur independently of and prior to mRNP granule formation. Recent findings that this association antagonizes the Ataxin-2 condensation [82] are consistent with a model in which the Atx2-PAM2 motif interacts with PABP in translating mRNAs to support efficient translation

. While these different functions could represent different modes of engagement with distinct sets of mRNAs, the data are also consistent with another model. Sequential interactions mediated by different protein regions during mRNP modelling allow Ataxin-2 to contribute in multiple ways to translational control to a single mRNA

. Prior observations showing that Atx2 IDR deletions suppress cytotoxicity in Drosophila models for neurodegeneration indicate that mRNP granules support events that lead to degenerative disease [61, 72, 74, 77]. If true, the expression of Atx2ΔLSm, which enhances granule assembly, would promote or potentially accelerate degeneration, while the expression of Atx2ΔcIDR would not

. While polyA tails and PABP are known to support translation and the Ataxin-2 PAM2 domain is involved in targeting the protein to polysomes [84], existing data do not directly address how Ataxin-2 PAM2 motif interactions contribute to translational activation. One possibility, supported by observations on the period mRNA is that the PAM2 domain guides Ataxin-2 to the 3’UTR of its target mRNAs [100]

. Despite the high conservation of the structured domains of Ataxin-2 between human and Drosophila, our data shows that human ATXN2 does not form distinct granules in S2 cells and that this outcome is not dependent on the evolutionary divergence of the structured domains ( panels A-B of V Fig in S1 File ). Furthermore, the human gene is not sufficiently conserved to replace the essential functions of fly atx2 in vivo ( panel C of V Fig in S1 File )

. A recent discovery that human ATN2 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as SCA2 ALS and Parkinson’s disease [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 16, 17 18, 19, 20 21, 22 23, 24 25, 26 27, 28 29, 30 31, 32 33, 34 35, 36 37, 38 39, 40 41, 42 43, 44 45, 46, 48 49, 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 101 103 105 107 109 111 113 115 117 119 121 123 125 127 129 131 133 135 137 139 141 143 145 149 153 157 161 165 169 173 177 181 185 189 193 197 201 205 209 213 217 221 225 229 233 237 241 245 249 253 257 261 269 273 281 289 297 305 313 321 329 337 345 353 361 369 377 385 393 401 409 417 433 441 457 473 489 505 529 561 593 625 665 737 809 881 1061 1225 1369 1521 1825 2049 2209 2561 2561 2561 2561 256 2561 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256 256

    Title: 
    Abstract: Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations. Despite recent efforts, a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated. Here, we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression. We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being, together with Myf5, a major upstream regulator during early development. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb. Thus, we propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. Finally, while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy.

   . In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal functional roles of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of the EOM progenitor population using combinations of genetically modified and lineage traced mice. Our study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo and identifies differential cycling states, dynamics of commitment, and establishment of MuSC quiescence in EOMs compared to limb muscles

. Deletion of Pax7 in adult MuSCs results in reduced MuSC numbers and impaired regeneration following muscle injury [40, 41]. While Pax7 is dispensable for EOM formation during embryonic development [30], the presence of MuSCs in the EOMs of postnatal Pax7 null mice and the relative roles of Pax7 and Pitx2 in maintaining these MuSCs remain unresolved. Finally, several reports showed that expression of Pitx2 in postnatal MuSCs is higher in EOMs than in limb muscles [10, 11, 42]

. Despite this uniformity in the acquisition of myogenic cell fate, an underlying heterogeneity characterises the embryonic cells that emerge in different anatomical locations. In the trunk, the paralogous transcription factors Pax3 ( Paired Box 3 ) and Pax7 ( Paired Box 7 ) regulate the emergence of muscle stem ( Pax3+ or Pax7+ ) and committed ( Myf5+, Mrf4+ or Myod+ ) cells [1, 15, 16]

. In this context, conditional inactivation of Pitx2 in neural-crest-derived cells does not affect the specification of the EOM primordia, but it results in severe muscle patterning defects [67]. We demonstrated herein a temporal requirement for Pitx2 during lineage progression: deletion of this gene in muscle progenitors ( Myf5Cre ) results in the absence of myofibres and upstream cells in the embryo, while deletion in myoblasts ( MyodiCre ) does not

In the trunk, both at the dermomyotome and limb levels, expression of Pax3 and Myf5 precede the expression of Pax7 [1, 64–66], with Pax3 expression being then rapidly downregulated during myogenic cell commitment ( i. e. in Myod+ cells ). Following the establishment of a muscle anlagen ( uncommitted and differentiated cells ), Pax7 is expressed from mid-embryogenesis in the upstream undifferentiated population, and it persists to give rise to adult MuSCs [17, 64]

. Given that Pitx2 is a major upstream regulator of the EOM lineage, we assessed whether Pitx2+ cells would expand in the Pax7 KO. Co-immunostaining for Pax7 and Pitx2 in Pax7 KO mice at embryonic and adult stages showed that the number of Pitx2+GFP+ cells were similar in the Pax7 KO and control mice for both EOMs and TA ( Figs 2J–2L and S2J–S2L ). Moreover, unlike other skeletal muscles, EOMs were reported to contain another population of interstitial stem cells that are Pax7-Pitx2+ [43]

. Further, deletion of this gene in Pax7+ cells led to a reduction in the number of foetal MuSCs in the EOMs, whereas Pitx2 function appears to be dispensable for the maintenance of these MuSCs in the adult ( Fig 8 ). In this muscle group, Myf5 and Mrf4 also play critical roles as EOMs and the upstream population are absent in Myf5;Mrf4 double mutants [21]

. In contrast to the diversity in upstream regulators, Pax7 marks all adult MuSCs and their ancestors from mid-embryogenesis [1]. In the trunk, Pax7+ myogenic cells are primed by prior Pax3 expression during embryonic development [31]. However, the mechanisms that govern the emergence and maintenance of cranial myogenic cells are poorly understood

. Yet, as no MuSC lineage-specific deletion of Pitx2 has been performed in EOMs, it is unclear: i ) to what extent Pitx2 is required temporally for emergence and maintenance of the MuSC population, and its relative function compared to the MRFs and Pax7; ii ) if Pitx2 is continuously required for maintenance of the adult MuSC population. Further, global deletion of Pax7 in trunk and limb muscles leads to an extensive loss of MuSCs during early postnatal development [35–39]

. To investigate the role of Pax7 in MuSCs in EOMs compared to limb muscles, we examined Pax7nGFP/nGFP knock-out mice ( Pax7 KO ) ( Fig 2A and 2B ) where Pax7-null and heterozygous cells are GFP+ and GFP expression persists in more differentiated cells [21, 49]. At P20, the number of GFP+ cells ( per area and per 100 fibres ) was significantly reduced both in EOMs and TA of Pax7 KO mice compared to heterozygous controls, although to a greater extent in the EOMs ( Fig 2C, S2A–S2C Fig )

. 5 and P21 compared to the limb. This unique feature could explain, at least in part, the larger MuSC pool in the EOMs. It could result from different dynamics of myogenic lineage progression taking place in EOMs and limb muscles during the growth phase in vivo and be related to the deferred differentiation of activated extraocular MuSCs observed in vitro [10]

Muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) arise during late foetal development and contribute to the postnatal growth of muscle fibres. They are the main players for reconstituting muscle fibres during regeneration. This population of stem cells emerges in an asynchronous manner in different anatomical locations, and it exhibits an unusual diversity in developmental origins and genetic regulation depending on the muscle group in which it resides [1–3]

. In this context, a higher number of dying cells per muscle area were observed in Pax7 null EOMs compared to controls at P1, suggesting that this might be a critical period where compensation by other factors is minimal. Finally, previous studies showed that Pax7 is required for limb myogenic cells to express genes normally associated with functional MuSCs such as Syndecan4 and CD34 [36, 38]

. In the head of vertebrate models analysed, Pax7+ myogenic cells were reported to emerge de novo, as Pax3 is not expressed in head MuSCs [21, 23, 32, 33]. Instead, and like the role of Pax3 in the trunk and limbs, Pitx2 is critically required cell-autonomously to maintain myogenic progenitors in an immature state, ensure their survival until the end of the embryonic period, and to activate the MRFs [30]

. Several studies analysed the limb and trunk phenotypes of constitutive [35–38] and inducible [39–41] Pax7 mutants. While MuSC progenitors are initially specified in homeostatic conditions [38], the progressive loss of MuSCs in newborn mice appears to be due to proliferation defects of MuSCs and cell death [37, 38]

. 5 and P21. The perdurance of the GFP allowed us to trace the progenitors and more differentiated cells. We highlight several differences between the EOM and TA muscles ( Fig 8 ). First, a greater reduction of GFP+ cells per area was noted in Pax7 null EOMs compared to TA, suggestive of a more relevant role for Pax7 in the maintenance of MuSCs without a history of Pax3 expression

. Examination of this interstitial population in mutant versus control EOMs showed similar proportions between both ( S2J–S2 and S2J–2 ), indicating that Pit2 is dispensable for the maintenance of MuSC in the EOM. However, the number of Pax7+ cells was significantly reduced in the EOM of Pax7 null mice compared to controls ( Fig 8 ), suggesting that Pax7 is required for the maintenance of MuSC in the EOM

In contrast to limb muscles, MuSC in EOM adopt a quiescent state and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult ( Figs 8–8 and S8–8 ), yet EOM have a higher content of Pax+ MuSC per area pre- and postnatally ( Figs 2–2 and S2–2 ). Moreover, in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly fewer MuSC were present in the EOM of mdx mice compared to controls and were not proliferative ( Figs 8–8 and S8–8 ). Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and brings insights into the unusual sparing of EOM during muscular dystrophy

In this study, we examined the spatiemporal roles of Pit2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of the E progenitor population using genetically modified and traced mice. Our study provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal in vivo and identifies cycling states, dynamics, commitment, and establishment of Mu quiescence in EOM compared limb muscles.

The final answer to the user's question is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the information provided text, it can be inferred that the main conclusion of the study is that Pitx and Pax7 play distinct roles in the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different anatomical locations, specifically in the extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. The study found that Pit2 is dispensable for the maintenance of MuSC in the EOM, while Pax7 is required for the maintenance of Mu in the E. The study also found that Mu in the E adopt a quiescent state and do not proliferate in the adult, yet have a higher content of Pax+ Mu per area pre and postnat.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-IN, which combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. The algorithm emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and achieve accurate fitting. Variants of COVID-19 exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments. To evaluate the risk, simulating transmission within the population and time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial. The VOC-IN leverages available data and physical principles governing disease to capture the time-vary nature of parameters. 

The algorithm integrates Physics-Informed Networks (PIN) with disease models, particularly the proposed VOC-IN, represents a significant contribution. VOC-IN accurately fits data and infers time-vary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into neural networks. The evolution of viruses allows them to adjust to environments and hosts; SARS-2 continues to evolve and mutate. Since 2020, several SARS-2 variants with significant mutations emerged and classified by WHO as VOCs (concern) or VOIs (interest). The algorithm was applied to the spread of VOCs in the province of BC and its regions, results aligning with real data and enabling short-term predictions. Parameters from the network are persuasive and simulations using ODE validate accuracy.
Researchers introduce CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that aggregates single-cell data into profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning, improving performance by 30-68% in average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single morphological feature data and providing an aggregated profile as output. The model achieves this by downweighting mitotic cells or debris and prioritizing large, uncrow cells. The approach requires perturbation labels for training, readily available in cell profiling datasets. CyNet offers a post-processing step for single profiles that significantly boosts performance on image-based datasets.

CytoNet applies contrastive learning to already-extracted single features, making it applicable to most image profiling datasets. The data is treated as a collection of sets, where each sample corresponds to a set based on the mathematical definition. The Deep Sets formulation learns a model that aggregates single data into a profile that outperforms population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism of action. CyNet's latent representation prioritizes biological signal over technical variance at cell and plate levels. Although it cannot be transferred out-distribution, it can be re-trained on new data, making a valuable tool for future profiling studies.

CytoNet captures heterogeneity, a characteristic of cell populations, improving profile information and utility in image-based applications. An examination reveals that relevant cells are generally larger, isolated, and do not contain high-intensity pixels. Single profiles are aggregated by various methods to a perturbation that describes population's phenotype. Profiles can be compared to identify unrecognized cell states induced by perturbations. Image-based profiling is a powerful tool for drug discovery, genomics, and phenotyping, but challenges include capturing population and single variability. CyNet addresses these limitations, automatically aggregating single data to improve profile information.

CyNet's performance is consistent with studies emphasizing context when analyzing phenotypic variance and genetic interactions, supporting focusing on large, uncrow cells provide accurate data for perturb effects on populations. The model is limited to data under similar conditions as training. In contrast, larger cells receive higher weights.
Researchers have developed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study highlights the value of characterizing brain dynamics and costs in understanding cognitive processes and offers insights into the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. A stochastic framework was employed to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during the Stro task. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG data, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in experiments. The method was generalized to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than fMRI, analyzing a dataset on performing a Stro task. A correlation was found between cost and RTs, showing reduced cost associated with improved performance.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals. To date, the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown. Here, P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs, and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness, and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies, a single MBC was cultured, and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Thus, we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. Notably, B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different. Together, our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs. The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria.

   . Notably, one clone ( A1F12 ) exhibited high binding affinity, comparable to that of the classical MBC clone ( B4E11 ), and produced broadly inhibitory antibodies against the binding of diverse PvDBPII variants to human erythrocytes. Together, our findings highlight a protective role of aMBCs in humoral immune response to malaria by differentiating into ASCs for producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes

. Identifying MBC subsets or phenotypes that play a major role in producing protective antibodies will facilitate development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines. Here, we demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aMBCs in vivax malaria. In acute infections, PvDBPII-TH2-specific MBCs were detected in 17 individuals ( average 0. 024%, SD 0. 020% ). Of these, 11. 28% and 40. 24% expressed aMBC and classical MBC phenotypes, respectively

. However, four clones of aMBCs produced anti-PvDBPII antibodies in low reactivity ( Fig 2F ). Since a key challenge in development of an efficacious malaria vaccine is the antigenic polymorphism of the parasites, we assessed the generation of cross-reactive aMBCs from P. vivax infections and their competency to secrete antibodies against variant antigens

. Although expansion of aMBCs in malaria has been reported [14, 20, 27, 41], the competency of these cells to differentiate into ASCs for secreting protective anti-malarial antibodies remains unknown. Here, we used single MBC cultures ( Nojima cultures ) to demonstrate P. vivax-specific aMBC function in ASC differentiation. The culture system contains MS40L-low feeder cells and multiple cytokines ( IL-2, IL-4, IL-21 and BAFF ) [31, 32]. Our result demonstrated that P

. Here, in a low malaria transmission setting, we found that P. vivax-infected individuals with the first episode of clinical symptoms developed antigen-specific aMBCs. Thus, an acquisition of aMBC responses to malaria was not associated with repeated or chronic exposure to parasites. Our evidence was supported by a previous observation reporting that an expansion of atypical MBCs was a normal part of the humoral immune response to both malaria and influenza vaccinations [37]

. vivax malaria. This study has limitations. First, we selected PvDBPII, a leading blood-stage vaccine candidate [29, 30] with highly polymorphic characters in clinical studies [47], to demonstrate the development of P. vivax-specific aMBCs. However, this data may be useful for development of PvDBPII-based vaccines against diverse P. vivax variants. We did not detect MBCs specific for other P. vivax antigens or stages due to limited PBMC sample availability from our subjects

Expansions of bulk aMBCs have been reported during acute P. vivax malaria [14, 27, 28]. However, there is still limited knowledge on the specificity of the aMBCs. Given the potential of PvDBPII as blood-stage vaccine candidate [29, 30], this study used the most immunogenic variant alleles ( PvDBPII-TH2, -TH5 and reference Sal I strains ) [14] among Thai isolates to detect P. vivax-specific aMBCs. PBMCs from P

. Comparing the stimulation of aMBC responses by low-versus high-affinity antigens showed little or no difference, indicating that aMBCs selectively reduced responses to low-affinity antigens [24]. Additionally, aMBCs produce antibodies with the help of T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells [25]. In vivax malaria, an increased frequency of aMBCs was observed during both the acute and recovery phases of infections [14, 26–28]

. Thus, we focused our study on the durability of aMBC responses. These were observed during the recovery phase in 7 subjects indicating that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of antigen-specific aMBCs. The finding was consistent with similar observations in P. falciparum malaria [25, 35, 36]. The PfAMA1- and PfMSP1-specific aMBCs were detected in chronic P. falciparum-exposed individuals in Mali and Uganda [25, 35]

. Therefore, it seems that aMBCs act as a key player in immune responses ( both innate and adaptive immunity ) against malaria. Investigation of mechanisms and dependencies driving malaria-specific MBCs in antigen presentation, cytokine secretion and ASC differentiation will be beneficial for vaccine design. The BCR characteristics of aMBCs in P. falciparum malaria has been described [21, 44]

. Here, we highlight the generation of MBCs against diverse variant strains of P. vivax antigen following natural infection. Of the 28 subjects with acute malaria, three produced MBC responses to all tested antigens ( PvDBPII-TH2, -TH5, and reference Sal I ). Most patients produced strain-specific MBC responses; 25. 00%, 10. 71% and 3. 57% specific to PvDBPII-TH2, -TH5, and Sal I strains, respectively. Our data suggested that natural P

The differentiation of these MBC subsets into ASCs potentially leads to potential production of broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax parasite binding and invasion of human erythrocytes

Expansion of aMBCs ( CD21-CD27-Tbet+ ) was found in chronic P

Lastly, larger sample size for aMBC characterization and its ability in ASC differentiation for neutralizing antibody production, as well as V ( D ) J gene analysis, would better capture the variability of V ( D ) J gene rearrangements and their functional roles in the context of aMBC responses to P. vivax malaria.

. falciparum exposure in regions of high malaria endemicity [20–22]. These cells overexpress inhibitory receptors ( FCRL5, CD11c and CXCR3 ), and have a reduction in the B-cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling pathway, leading to ineffective B cell production of antibodies [20, 21]. However, a recent study showed that aMBCs responded to membrane-associated antigens [23]

. Through study of in vitro cultures, aMBCs were shown to secrete immunoglobulin after receiving IFN-γ and IL-21 signals [26]. These previous reports were based on bulk aMBCs, of either CD21-CD27- or CD21-CD27-Tbet+FCRL5+ cells. Here, we used single aBC cultures to demonstrate P. viv-specific aBC function in ASC differentiation and antibody production. The system contained MSLow feeder cells and cytokines ( IL-2, IL-4, IL-21 and BAFF ) [31, 32. Our results showed that P. viv-specific aBC were elicited during acute malaria and persisted through recovery phase of infections. The finding was consistent with previous observations in P. falcum malaria [25, 35, 36. PfAMA- and PfSP1-specific aBC were detected in chronic P. falcum-exposed individuals in Mali and Uganda [25,35]. Thus, it seems that aBC play a key role in immune responses both innate and adaptive immunity against malaria. Investigation of mechanisms and dependencies driving malaria-specificBC in antigen presentation, cytokine secretion and ASC will be beneficial for vaccine design. BCR of aBC in P falcum malaria has been described [21, 44]. Here we highlight generation ofBC against variant of P viv antigen following natural infection. Of 28 subjects with malaria produced M responses to tested antigens PvDBI-TH,TH, and Sal I. Most produced strain-specific M responses 25 10 71 and 3 57 to PvI-TH,TH, Sal respectively. Our data suggested that natural P viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P viv-specific aBC. The accumulation of aBC during infections might play an important role in producing antibodies against malaria.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics, especially in the context of precision medicine. Recently, mr. mash, a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy, was introduced. However, a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. By using summary data, we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has smaller sample size.

   . mash requires individual-level data, i. e., genotypes and phenotypes for each individual and, mainly for privacy reasons, these data are rarely publicly available [21]. Second, mr. mash does not scale well to datasets with very large sample size, such as modern biobanks. These weaknesses limit the use of mr. mash for PGS prediction in human genetics. In this work, we overcome both these limitations by introducing “mr. mash Regression with Summary Statistics” or “mr

We test mr. mash-rss in the task of PGS prediction for multiple phenotypes jointly via simulations in several scenarios and show that it is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy with currently available methods. We then confirm these results in the analysis of real data for 16 blood cell traits in the UK Biobank [23, 24].

. In fact, recent work has shown that imputing missing values results in improved prediction accuracy of PGS and power in GWAS [47, 48]. Nonetheless, our results showed that mr. mash-rss is robust to a small to medium amount of missing phenotypes. In addition, in specific cases such as with complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes, some simplifications arise that allow for models like mr. mash-rss to be fitted efficiently [38]. Our work showed that mr

Through an array of simulations and real data analysis using the UK Biobank, we showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate PGS methods. Of note, mr. mash-rss outperformed competing methods in 14 out of 16 blood cell phenotypes, although the magnitude of the improvement varied across phenotypes, from modest to substantial

In this work, we have introduced mr. mash-rss, the summary data version of a recently developed empirical Bayes multivariate multiple regression method [20]. Like mr. mash, mr. mash-rss enjoys ( 1 ) the ability to learn patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes; ( 2 ) the ability to model dozens of phenotypes jointly; ( 3 ) computational efficiency. Additionally, mr. mash-rss addresses two important limitations of mr

. In that case, modeling these phenotypes jointly via multivariate multiple regression methods can improve effect sizes estimates by leveraging effect sharing and, thus, increase prediction accuracy [13–17]. Integrative approaches that combine multiple single-phenotype PGSs across phenotypes have also been shown to improve prediction accuracy [18, 19]. Recently, Morgante et al. ( 2023 ) introduced the “Multiple Regression with Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage” or “mr. mash” [20]. mr

We devised a simulation study where the goal was to compare mr. mash-rss and other competing methods at computing PGS for multiple phenotypes from summary data. We used real genotypes from the UK Biobank array data for n = 105, 000 nominally unrelated White British individuals that were randomly sampled. After applying a series of filters ( see S1 Text for details ), the data included p = 595, 071 genetic variants

. mash-rss are very small. Previous analyses have shown that phenotypes with smaller sample size gain more advantage from multivariate modeling [20, 41]. We hypothesized that more substantial improvements in prediction accuracy from using mr. mash-rss could be obtained with a smaller sample size. Thus, we repeated the same analysis on 75, 000 individuals, randomly sampled from the total of 244, 049. The results, summarized in Fig 5 and S2 Table, showed that this is indeed the case

. This highlights that the general mr. mash model can adapt to either more sparse ( e. g., for gene expression [20] ) or more dense ( e. g., for complex traits ) genetic architectures. We also showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy from using mr. mash-rss increased substantially with a smaller sample size

This is achieved through the use of flexible priors on the effect sizes across phenotypes and an empirical Bayes ( EB ) framework to adapt these priors to the data. Computational effiency is achieved by using Variational Inference ( VI ) as opposed to the more expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods

. We compared mr. mash-rss to a few competing methods that satisfied the following requirements: ( 1 ) can be fitted with only summary data; ( 2 ) do not require a validation data set to tune model parameters; ( 3 ) for multivariate methods, are able to model at least 5 phenotypes jointly

. It is well-known that issues with analyses with summary statistics arise when the reference panel and the GWAS population do not match [27, 35, 36]. Thus, it is important to assess the robustness of mr. mash-rss to the choice of the LD matrix. While we note that all the simulations above used an LD matrix that was computed using a subset of UK Biobank individuals that did not overlap with those used to compute the summary statistics, we also tested the performance of mr

To evaluate mr. mash-rss on a real data application, we sought to predict blood cell traits from genotypes using the UK Biobank data. The UK Biobank is a dataset of roughly 500, 000 individuals with genetic and phenotypic data [39]. We focused on a subset of 16 blood cell traits that have been used for quantitative genetic analyses in previous work [24]

. For a detailed account of VI and EB in this context, including the advantages, we direct the reader to [20]. Using multi-tissue gene expression prediction from cis-genotypes as an example, the authors showed that mr. mash is competitive in terms of both prediction accuracy and speed [20]. However, while powerful, mr. mash has some limitations. First, mr. mash requires individual-level data, i. e

. In human genetics, predicting medically relevant phenotypes such as disease risk via polygenic scores ( PGS ) is important to stratify the population and identify individuals with greater genetic risk [2]. Finally, with the advent of transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ), predicting gene expression as an intermediate step has become of interest [3]. In all these applications, accurate predictions are important

. mr. mash-rss was the best performing method, while wMT-SBLUP was the worst in this scenario. In the High Polygenicity scenario ( Fig 2B ), prediction accuracy achieved by all the methods was much lower than in the Equal Effects scenario with 5, 000 causal variants ( Fig 1A ). This is expected since each causal variant explains a much smaller proportion of phenotypic variance and, consequently, the effects are harder to estimate accurately. However, mr

. This holds good promise for improving prediction accuracy for phenotypes that are difficult to measure and in samples of individuals of non-European descent, which are usually much smaller [44]. In addition, the performance of the mr. mash model depends on the accuracy of the “data-driven” covariance matrices [20]. Thus, advances in covariance matrix estimation can potentially lead to improvements in prediction accuracy. A limitation of mr

. Per-phenotype prediction accuracy was computed as the R2 from the linear regression of the true phenotypes on the predicted phenotypes. We used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of mr. mashss and competing methods. For each fold, we trained the model on 90 % of the data and tested on 10 %. We repeated this 10 times and computed the average R2 across the 10 folds. We also computed the standard error of the mean ( SEM ) of the R2 across the 10 folds to assess the variability of the results.
This study proposes a novel framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (U) model. Data from the Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the U model using deep learning and calibrate the mechanistic model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. The study projects the attack and peak of new infections for the Omic wave in China after the dynamic-COVID policy adjustment, indicating an attack rate and peak of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97 and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations show heterogeneity decreases herd immunity 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak 30-70 days, aligning with real cases. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity.

 The approach involves shaping the spread of susceptibles during the Omic variant outbreak using two methodologies: employing deep learning for the U model and MCM for the mechanistic model. Given limited information, the U framework is a good for learning recruitment from data, utilizing the universal property of neural networks to present and train the specific form. A generalized framework and machine learning approach is developed to pre-set the specific form from epidemic data. The model is applied to project trends of COVID-19 variants, comparing accuracy with traditional frameworks. The aim is to embed spatio-temp heterogeneity into homogeneous models for efficient prediction and enhance accuracy.

 The study incorporates heterogeneity into classical models, depicting the epidemic curve of the Omic variant in China, including size, size, immunity, and duration. The accuracy is significantly enhanced compared to homogeneous. A dual strategy combines strengths of learning and mechanistic to a comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting disease dynamics. Estimated results show the data-driven approach is flexible in capturing information, with a slight increase around day 65. The importance of incorporating method into compartment frameworks is highlighted, enhancing accuracy and decision-making in infectious diseases.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

   . The functional implication of noisy synaptic transmission, and whether it is a feature or bug in biological and artificial neuronal systems, is therefore highly debated [5, 10–13]. Here, we show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. With each synapse doing this, we further show that this enables a neuronal network to encode and utilize uncertainties

. In contrast, the SPP proposed here makes very precise predictions about the interplay of synaptic and neural dynamics. Our model directly predicts that synapses should be stochastic to effectively encode uncertainties about the somatic membrane potential. Furthermore, the SPP makes precise predictions about the synaptic plasticity changes in post-pre-post spike pairing protocols and the dependence on the synaptic weight ( Fig 2 )

. We apply PP to individual synapses, arguing that the dynamics of a synapse can be considered as an agent interacting with its cellular environment, and derive a synaptic learning rule by minimizing the surprise in individual synapses. This learning rule enables synapses to adapt their synaptic efficacy to best predict future postsynaptic spikes, which are registered by back-propagating action potentials ( bAPs ). In contrast to previous approaches ( e. g

. The synaptic variability can also be exploited to reflect uncertainty in neural firing. We let the postsynaptic neuron learn to fire according to Gaussian distributions of firing times with different spreads σout ( Fig 3H, σout = 5 ms and σout = 10 ms ). The variability in firing times is reflected in the neuron spiking after learning. During the phase of stochastic firing we observe a high trial-to-trial variability in the dynamics of the membrane potential ( insets in Fig 3H )

. In other words, as we show here, the task of a synapse to learn suitable synaptic responses can be considered as a problem of behaving in a partially unknown environment, where the variability in synaptic release is being used to properly represent the uncertainty of the synapse about the cellular, environmental state

. We consider the synapse as an agent and the postsynaptic neuron as its environment. Furthermore, we consider the somatic membrane potential u as the state variable of the neuron, since it determines the neuron’s spiking behavior

. g., to address the role of neural compartmentalization [21, 22], cortical mocrocircuits [23], and dendritic trees for few short learning [24]. In the current study we focus on the temporal dynamics of the uncertainty that is being induced by sparse back-propagating action potentials and the role of noise in synaptic transmission. This synapse-centric view on predictive processing allows us to study the precise timing of synaptic dynamics in terms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity

. On the network level, our computer simulations indicate that SPP allows several thousand synapses to exploit their synaptic noise to successfully master different learning paradigms despite ambiguous or uncertain inputs.

. To demonstrate the role of stochastic synapitc release in the pattern classification task, we created ambiguous patterns by mixing the spikes of two patterns ( ▫ and ☆ ) with different mixing rates ( Fig 4E ). Mixing rates of 0 ( 1 ) corresponds to a pattern that is identical to ▫ ( ☆ ). This can be encoded by a network with unreliable ( left, noisy synapses ) and with reliable synaptic transmission ( right, without noise )

In summary, we have presented a synapse-centric account of PP that views synapses as agents that interact with their post-synaptic neuron much like an organism interacts with its environment. The emerging SPP learning rule is qualitatively consistent with experimentally observed synaptic mechanisms while being analytically tractable

In contrast to previous approaches ( e. g., [20] ) that used PP to understand the influence of neuromodulatory signals such as Dopamine on synaptic plasticity, we focus here on a PP perspective of synaptic plasticity [21, 22], unraveling the dynamics of a single synapse governed by only locally accessible quantities such as the pre- and postsynaptic-spike times and the current value of the synaptic efficacy. This is the only assumption made in our model

. This view allows us to separate the ‘what’ and ‘when’ information flow in the synapse model, which leads to local synaptic weight updates ( see derivation in Sections 1–8 in S1 Appendix ). The actions of a synapse to interact with the soma are given by the postsynaptic currents ( PSCs ) y ( ‘what’ ) that are released in response to pre-synaptic spikes ( ‘when’ )

. This shows that despite the theoretical assumption of M → ∞, the model copes well with sparse inputs. To further investigate the network effects of the SPP learning rule, we implemented a closed loop setup where a recurrent spiking neural network controls a behaving agent. So far, we have treated the pre-synaptic firing times that trigger the synaptic PSC release as externally given, resulting in the reduced model where synapses only control post-synaptic firing

. In the next section, we will show that the stochastic bridge model can also be used to infer biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules to adapt the synaptic efficacies w, and that this implies an update of the internal model of the synapse. Learning in the SPP means to adapt the synaptic efficacy w to minimize the “surprise” caused by bAPs z, where surprise is measured with respect to the synapse’s internal model of the soma p ( u | z )

. However, as suggested by experimental findings [29], the actual value of the somatic membrane potential is hidden from the synapse and therefore the synapse has to infer the value of u from the sparse information that propagates back from the soma into the dendrites. We consider that this sparse feedback is implemented by bAP events z, given by the firing times t 1 post, t 2 post, …, t n post, … of the postsynaptic neuron

. At the same time, synapses are very demanding in terms of energy consumption [6], suggesting that a large portion of the body’s energy intake dissipates by the unreliability of synaptic transmission. Similar to biological synapses also neuromorphic technologies are exposed to noise culminating in unreliable synaptic transmission [7–9]

. A detailed derivation of the synapse model can be found in Sections 1–8 in S1 Appendix. We use a stochastic synapse model of input-dependent PSCs, where the variability is proportional to the synaptic efficacy w [26]. The amplitudes of current pulses, y, were drawn from a Gaussian distribution, y ∼ N ( y | r 0 M w, s 0 M 2 w ), independently for every input spike, where w is the synaptic weight and M is a scaling parameter

. The results are shown in Fig 5D. Interestingly, the best performance was not achieved with deterministic synapses ( r0 = 1 ), but noisy synapses consistently showed lower MSE. This result shows that stochastic synaptic release in the SPP learning framework, introduced here, can be beneficial also at the behavioral level.

. Note that the pre-synaptic spike times and the LIF neuron model are deterministic here, so the required trial-by-trial variability is generated exclusively by the synapses. Hence, synapses have learned to utilize their intrinsic variability or noise to drive the deterministic neuron to fire according to a defined probability. The variability in the learning task was also reflected in the distribution of synaptic weights

. We forced all neurons to repeatedly fire according to the fixed pattern while the learning rule Eq ( 11 ) was active. SPP learning installs behavior in the synapses that supports ( or predicts ) the neuron dynamics ( Fig 3B–3D ). Individual PSCs after learning are shown for five example synapses in Fig 3B. The injected currents show high trial-by-trial variability, and the amplitude strongly depends on the relative pre- and post-synaptic firing

    This study proposes that synapses use noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework is developed where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn strives to predict somatic dynamics of postsyn neuron, but emergent dynamics of many syn in network resolve learning problems like classification or control in dynamic environment. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in network in ambiguous situations. 

 The study shows synapses can exploit noisy transmission to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. A model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode somatic potential. The model makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity in post-post spike protocols and dependence on synaptic weight. The model is applied to individual synapses, considering dynamics as interacting with cellular environment, deriving a learning rule minimizing surprise in syn. This rule enables syn to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes registered by backpropagating potentials. Synaptic variability is used to reflect uncertainty in firing. Postsyn neuron learns to fire according Gaussian distributions with spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in neuron spiking during stochastic phase. The study focuses on temporal uncertainty induced by backag potentials and role in transmission. Synaptic view on processing allows precise timing dynamics in spike-dependent plasticity. Network simulations show synapses exploit noise to master learning paradigms despite uncertain inputs. A pattern task is created by mixing spikes of two patterns with different rates. Mixing 0 corresponds to identical pattern. This can be encoded by network with unreliable synapses and reliable transmission. The study presents a syn-centric view of processing where synapses interact with postsyn like organism with environment. Emerging learning is consistent with experimentally observed mechanisms and analytically tractable.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

    Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies enable detailed analyses of development and cell differentiation [1–3]. We presented Scuphr, a probabilistic framework that reconstructs cell lineage trees from healthy, diploid single-cells using whole-genome amplified DNA sequencing data. Scuphr is designed with the challenges of the scDNA-seq data in mind, it fits well with the biological findings, and in particular, it obtains better accuracy with leveraging read-phasing

Reconstructing cell lineage trees, from single-cell data, for healthy tissue is a fundamental computational problem with enormous potential for studies of development and differentiation [1–6]. There are two related reconstruction problems for cancer tumors: reconstruction of clonal trees and the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies from single cells. Several data types, e. g., bulk DNA, single-cell DNA, and single-cell RNA, have been used for the latter two problems [7–11]

. Therefore, mutations are scarce when reconstructing lineage trees for healthy tissues, implying that more sophisticated models and computational methods are needed to capitalize fully on the existing mutations. This scarcity also highlights the need for single-cell DNA sequencing ( scDNA-seq ) data since it reveals more point mutations than any other current data type [13]. Regardless of its potential to reveal mutations, scDNA-seq data comes with its challenges [14–18]

Scuphr is a distance-based phylogenetic inference method that reconstructs cell lineage trees from scDNA-seq data, produced by experimental procedures that amplify the cells’ genomes, using amplification methods such as the MDA method [20] and the MALBAC method [21]. Analyses of this data type need to distinguish somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification

. For details, see S1 Appendix. The dataset consists of scDNA-seq data for 18 cells with a recent common origin and a known lineage tree topology. This single-cell DNA data has been obtained by amplifying the DNA using MALBAC before the sequencing. These cells are so closely related that very few mutations distinguish them; hence, it is very hard to reconstruct the true lineage tree topology

. Third, a single distance matrix is obtained by combining the site-associated distance matrices, Fig 1c. Finally, the cell lineage tree is reconstructed by applying the NJ algorithm to the final distance matrix, Fig 1d. In addition, the site-associated distance matrices can be sampled with replacement several times to obtain bootstrap lineage tree samples, which could be used to get consensus trees and edge supports

. As our goal is to reconstruct the cell lineage tree topology, we have not placed emphasis on estimating the the branch lengths. With our experimental studies, we have shown that Scuphr has high accuracy in terms of tree topology reconstruction; however, we caution that the branch lengths estimates obtained in the tree reconstruction step needs further validation.

. This advantage makes it possible to analyze millions of sites in the genome, whereas most state-of-the-art methods can handle only a few thousand sites. Finally, we evaluated the performance of Scuphr using a biological dataset of 18 single cells acquired from [30]. We selected approximately 3. 4 million candidate sites for analysis and used bootstrapping to obtain edge supports on the reference tree topology

In order to compare the performances of the methods in a controlled way, we synthetically generated datasets. We created the ground truth cell lineage trees, and assigned mutations to the edges of the tree; all cells under the edge inherit the mutation. We generated the genomes of the cells and simulated the amplification and read sequencing processes. We accounted for various amplification, allelic dropout, and sequencing errors, as well as different levels of gSNVs within the genome

. LiRA [29] and Conbase [30] are scDNA-seq SNV callers that leverage read-phasing, while the latter does variant calling based on the population of single cells. There has been a sequence of single-cell tree reconstruction methods targeting cancer data, [31–36], leading up to the SCIΦ method [37]. Interestingly, for the cancer case, the infinite sites assumption ( ISA, [38–40] ) may be violated due to segmental deletions

. Scuphr is designed for healthy, diploid scDNA-seq data. However, it can be enhanced to handle cancer data by incorporating copy number variations into its model. We will investigate how the extended model handles the challenges of single-cell tumor data and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods in our future work.

. In addition to the distance-based and MCMC-based methods, various variational inference based methods have recently been developed for tree reconstruction tasks [50–53]. These methods typically operate in the standard phylogeny setting and require a good set of initial trees for their analysis. In the potential future development of such methods where the domain moves toward the single-cell setting, Scuphr could provide a good set of bootstrap trees as input quickly

. All these reconstruction methods exploit mutations and attempt to reconstruct trees in which the proximity between a pair of cells, or clones, is correlated with the similarity between their patterns of mutations. The somatic mutation rate in humans is 10−9 per locus per cell division [12], and the copy number is not considered to carry substantial information regarding cell lineage membership in healthy tissue

. The details of the synthetic data generation process are presented in Methods. We used the synthetic datasets to compare the methods in two ways; the lineage tree reconstruction accuracy and runtime. In this section, the accuracy of Scuphr SCIΦ, and Phylovar are compared using a fibroblast dataset previously used in [30]. The dataset used in this study is a slightly modified version of the dataset in [30]. For details, see S1 Appendix

. Unless otherwise stated, the model descriptions hold for all site types. Let Π be the set of sites selected for analysis and C be the number of single cells. The standard NJ algorithm [42] and its variants, such as FastNJ [44], are commonly used for distance-based methods. In the final step of Scuphr, the standard NJ algorithm is applied to the distance matrix to reconstruct the cell lineage tree using the implementation in the Dendropy library [45]

We evaluated the performance of Scuphr on a biological dataset with SCIΦ and Phylovar, and on several simulated datasets with SCIΦ. Our investigation focused on the algorithm’s robustness for varying numbers of single-cells, read coverages, and technological artifacts such as AEs, ADOs, and sequencing errors. We observed that for the low amplification error datasets, Scuphr performs on par or better than SCIΦ in most cases

. The distance is obtained by combining the probabilities of different genotypes across the selected sites for each pair of cells. Finally, this distance is used as an input to a distance-based phylogenetic method, the neighbor-joining ( NJ ) algorithm [42]. The summary of the Scuphr workflow is shown in Fig 1. The input to Scuphr consists of bulk and single-cell DNA reads. First, candidate mutation sites are detected using the site selection method, Fig 1a

. Moreover, so-called allelic dropout ( ADO ) events remain even after the amplification. In addition, the subsequent sequencing of the amplified materials introduces sequencing errors [22–25]. There have been several methods explicitly made for scDNA-seq data, both for identifying mutations ( single nucleotide variant ( SNV ) callers ) and for reconstructing cell lineage trees, although several of them are targeting cancer data

. To compare accuracy, we also applied SCIΦ to the fibroblast data ( Fig 6b ). Due to the input format requirement ( bulk and single-cell sequencing data in Mpileup format ), we could not run SCIΦ on the whole genome in a single run. Instead, we applied SCIΦ independently to each chromosome, see S1 Appendix for details. We sampled 100 bootstrap trees from the lineage trees reported by SCIΦ for the chromosomes; the trees were weighted by the number of identified mutations per chromosome

. The graphical model of Scuphr that is tailored for the healthy, diploid scDNA-seq data, combined with the NJ algorithm yields higher or as good accuracy as the state-of-the-art methods. Scuphr’s computational complexity is affected quadratically by the number of single cells. However, this issue can be redeemed with the embarrassingly parallel nature of the method. In addition, the dynamic programming technique is leveraged to calculate the read likelihoods efficiently

Researchers developed the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, a tailored tool to evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in Malawi, addressing limitations of analytic approaches used to weigh evidence for interventions. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating country-specific data on disease incidence, health behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under resource constraints, they simulated health gains under plausible HBP strategies. A linear optimization (LA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain, ~8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other prioritization approaches, such as service based on patient characteristics, achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark on a yearly basis and 5% reduction DALs over the period, suggesting this approach might be beneficial. The TLO provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, providing evaluations on health achievable through prioritization of services under realistic resource constraints, addressing limitations of other methods.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species. Yet, the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species. Here, we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago. We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Additionally, both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I. Surprisingly, in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Additionally, sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species. Instead, four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology.

    Here, we employed the Oligopaint DNA FISH technology to characterize meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holocentric pantry moth Plodia interpunctella for the first time. By visualizing single chromosomes at sub-chromosomal resolution, we found that meiotic homolog pairing during spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. This finding mirrors our previous studies in Bombyx mori, suggesting that this mechanism may be broadly conserved in Lepidopteran insects

. Our previous studies in Bombyx revealed that meiotic homolog pairing in the male germline is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. To test if this mechanism is conserved in Plodia, which diverged from Bombyx over 100 million years ago, we labeled one chromosome at a time using our stripe Oligopaints described above to quantify which chromosome region ( arms or center ) pairs first as cells progress through early meiotic prophase ( Fig 2A ) in early 5th instar larval testes

. Together, these findings support the notion that the centrally-restricted kinetochores we observe in moth spermatogenesis are functional and represent a novel mode of meiotic chromosome segregation for holocentric species.

. To our surprise, this experiment revealed that like Plodia, Bombyx telomeres are not utilized for kinetochore formation, despite their poleward-facing position. Instead, we observed Dsn1 localization away from telomeres and closer to the chromosome center, just as in Plodia ( S5 Fig ). Together, these data suggest that moths employ a novel “center-kinetic” segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome

. elegans, where telomeres face the spindle pole and kinetochore cups form around chromosomes [16, 29–34]. Our previous work in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, suggested that gene-rich chromosome domains near telomeres facilitate homolog recognition and that telomeres face the spindle poles for chromosome segregation in the male germline [35]

. Our studies here demonstrate the suitably of using Plodia as a model system for studying both conserved and divergent aspects of meiotic chromosome biology. Using Oligopaints to label multiple domains along individual chromosomes in Plodia larval testes, we find that pairing in Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to Bombyx. Additionally, both Bombyx and Plodia form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I

. However, whether these findings apply to all Lepidopteran insects ( of which there are almost 200, 000 spanning more than 120 million years of evolution ) is unknown. Here, we employ a combination of Oligopaint DNA FISH and immunofluorescence to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella and compare our findings to new and previous work in Bombyx. Plodia is a promising new laboratory model for genetics and genomics in Lepidoptera

. This mode of chromosome segregation appears to be a completely distinct mechanism from that employed by these moths during mitosis, where they are holocentric, and it is distinct from other previously described mechanisms of meiotic segregation in holocentric species. Together, our studies reveal that unique mechanisms dictate chromosome segregation dynamics in Lepidopteran spermatogenesis.

. These results suggest that the center-oriented bivalents at Plodia metaphase I are likely not a transition state ( since a transition to center-out does not happen until late anaphase ). Regardless of how homologs are associated at metaphase I, we surprisingly found that kinetochores always form toward the center of chromosomes. How kinetochore position is defined and regulated during spermatogenesis in moths is yet to be thoroughly explored

. However, lineage-specific adaptations to the holocentric structure result in unique mechanisms of chromosome segregation between species, with moths limiting kinetochore formation to the center of chromosomes during spermatogenesis. This work highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in new model systems, as exploring new systems can lead to the discovery of new biology.

. mori spermatogenesis. Even though Bombyx always display telomere-oriented bivalents and kinetochore proteins are seemingly present near chromosome ends at metaphase I [35], we wondered whether the kinetochores are actually further away from telomeres than previously appreciated in Bombyx. To test this, we performed the same co-IF-FISH assay with Dsn1 and Bombyx ch15 stripe paints in Bombyx 4th-5th instar larval testes squashes ( S5 Fig )

. However, while Bombyx bivalents always have telomeres oriented toward spindle poles at metaphase I in spermatogenesis, we find that Plodia bivalents can be either “telomere-oriented” ( telomeres facing spindle poles ) or “center-oriented” ( chromosome centers facing spindle poles ). Intriguingly, we find that both Plodia and Bombyx form kinetochores at non-telomeric loci towards chromosome centers, even when telomeres are oriented toward spindle poles

. Instead, we observed that bivalents can be positioned in either a telomere- or center-oriented configuration at metaphase I ( with telomeres or centers facing the spindle poles, respectively ). Furthermore, chromosome centers act as kinetochore-recruitment sites in Plodia spermatogenesis. A similar mechanism was observed in Bombyx spermatogenesis, despite the fact that telomeres are always oriented toward spindle poles in this species

. Holocentric species, like moths and C. elegans, face distinct challenges during meiosis compared to mitosis [17, 18]. Since recombination is typically suppressed in centromere-proximal regions of chromosomes across species [19–21], it is reasonable to predict that maintaining the holocentric structure during meiosis could largely inhibit recombination

. In Bombyx, we previously observed a similar bias in pairing initiation between chromosome arms and found that pairing initiation is strongly correlated with gene density, with gene-rich arms pairing earlier than gene-poor arms [35]. This same correlation was observed in our data from Plodia ( Figs 2D and S2A ), suggesting that gene-rich chromosome arms may initiate pairing broadly in Lepidoptera

. Despite these findings, how homologs find each other in three-dimensional nuclear space and distinguish between homologous partners and heterologous chromosomes is unclear in most other species. Additionally, the mechanisms mediating chromosome bi-orientation and segregation during meiosis I are still not well understood, specifically in holocentric species ( where kinetochores form all along the length of the chromosome during mitosis ). Holocentric species, like moths and C

. Together, we find that pairing initiation occurs at the distal regions of chromosome arms in Plodia, with gene-rich arms being more likely to pair before gene-poor arms. The symmetrical segregation of homologs during meiosis requires specific changes to chromosome structure compared to mitosis to allow for homologs to be properly bi-oriented at metaphase I

. A similar CO-based mechanism could explain the formation of telomere- and center-oriented bivalents in moths, but this has yet to be experimentally tested. For example, the telomere-oriented bivalents observed for all Bombyx and some Plodia chromosomes could be the result of a single distal CO, consistent with studies suggesting only a single CO occurs per chromosome in Lepidoptera [64–66]

. Finally, center-kinetic segregation is distinct from a classical “ pole-kinetic” mechanism where pole-facing kinchores are required for homolog separation during meiosis I. Our findings suggest that kinetoch formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome during spermat in moths, where telomeres face the spindle and kinchores form around chromosomes [16, 29–34].

    Title: 
    Abstract: The median eminence ( ME ), located at the base of the hypothalamus, is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary. We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, and this is likely of hypothalamic origin. We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In conclusion, because NG2-glia in the ME are the cells mostly affected by Sox3 loss and their proliferation, but not differentiation to oligodendrocytes, is corrected by either low-dose Aspirin treatment or by a ‘Crick-typical’ profile of gut microbiota, we propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning.

. Our study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation, and that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors.

. Building on previous work demonstrating the efficacy of aspirin in inducing proliferation and/or differentiation of NG2-glia [27, 28], we treated Sox3 mutants with low dose aspirin. We observed a restoration of NG2-glia proliferation, and a rescue of pituitary hormonal deficiencies, but not a rescue of myelination. We also found that changes in the gut microbiome ameliorate the hypopituitarism

. Using conditional gene deletion, we show that loss of Sox3 in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is sufficient to cause hypopituitarism and that this develops postnatally, at the time of weaning. Consequently, we observe in the pituitary a defective maturation of endocrine cells. SOX3 is expressed in hypothalamic stem cells and its deletion affects their proliferation in vivo and in hypothalamic neurosphere assays

. In mice, we showed that SOX3 is largely absent from the pituitary, but it is found in the developing and mature hypothalamus, being particularly highly expressed in the embryonic infundibulum and later maintained in the ME ( [26] and this study ). Here, we aimed to characterise the role of SOX3 in the hypothalamus and the etiology of the hypopituitarism

. Altogether these data show that the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3-/Y mice is of hypothalamic origin. The consequence, at the pituitary level, is an impairment of endocrine cell maturation, which becomes apparent after weaning and results in the production of insufficient levels of hormones. To determine the origin of the hypothalamic defect, we analysed SOX3 expression in more detail ( Fig 2A )

. SOX3 is also expressed in NG2-glia in the ME, and both their proliferation and differentiation are reduced in Sox3 mutants. Furthermore, we observe a striking deficiency in myelination of axons in the ME. Importantly, the appearance of all these defects correlates with development of hypopituitarism suggesting that SOX3 is required postnatally for the functional maturation of the ME

SOX3 is widely expressed in the developing CNS [22], but it is also retained within some brain regions postnatally, notably the hypothalamus [26], where its expression is found in tanycytic neural stem cells ( NSCs ) and several differentiated cell types [29]. In contrast, we only observed SOX3 in rare cells within the pituitary representing a very small subset of lactotrophs ( S1A Fig ). Therefore, the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3 mutants is likely to be of hypothalamic origin

. Collectively, this data suggests that the reduced number of NG2-glia and/or the lack of myelination underlies the reduction in pituitary hormone levels in Sox3-/Y mice. Two reports have suggested that aspirin can specifically affect NG2-glia [27, 28]

. To understand which aspect of hypothalamic function is affected in mutants, we examined the consequences of Sox3 loss on the pituitary. In parallel with the appearance of the hormonal deficiencies, we observed that the growth of the anterior lobe slows down significantly in Sox3-/Y compared to Sox3+/Y mice after weaning ( Fig 1D ). Furthermore, while the cellular density in Sox3+/Y animals sharply decreases between 4 and 5 weeks of age, it remains constant in Sox3-/Y ( Fig 1E )

. Therefore, SOX3 is necessary for self-renewal, but not differentiation in vitro, in hypothalamic neurospheres and this requirement correlates in time with the onset of hypopituitarism in mutant animals. We next performed neurosphere assays using Sox3+/ΔGFP females ( Fig 2K ). Due to the location of Sox3 on the X-chromosome and to random X chromosome inactivation, cells from these mice that normally transcribe Sox3 should express either SOX3 or GFP in roughly equal proportions

. Although the related factor SOX2, with which it is known to show functional redundancy, is expressed throughout the neuroepithelium, the absence of SOX3 does have consequences at this stage with respect to induction of the pituitary and its morphological development [26]. It seems likely that the hypothalamic stem cells, in which SOX2 is also expressed, are similarly more sensitive to the loss of SOX3

. A further indication that the hypopituitarism seen in the Sox3 mutants is likely due to a deficiency of NG2-glia comes from the restoration of both pituitary function and proliferation of NG2-glia with low dose aspirin, while differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes is still impaired. The canonical mode of action of low dose aspirin involves the suppression of cyclooxygenase ( COX ) 1 activities [74]

. In contrast, in Pou1f1-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice, neither GH ( Fig 1A ) nor Prolactin ( PRL ) ( S1B Fig ) contents are affected. These data are therefore in agreement with a CNS origin of the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3-/Y animals. To avoid undesirable effects originating from the Nestin-Cre transgene, we pursued our subsequent analyses on Sox3-/Y animals. We then measured GH contents at different time points after birth to determine when deficits appear in Sox3-/Y males ( Fig 1B )

. The reduction in the number of PDGFRa+ve NG2-glia, MAG+ve mature oligodendrocytes and concomitant increase of APC+ve cells observed in NIMR Sox3-/Y mice ( Figs 5B–5D and 6F–6G ) was confirmed in FT Sox3-/Y ME but absent in Crick Sox3-/Y ME ( Fig 6E–6F ). Altogether, these data indicate that changes of gut microbiota affect oligodendrocyte lineage composition in ME, and occurrence of hypopituitarism in Sox3-/Y mutants

. Moreover, while hypopituitarism seen in both mice and humans lacking SOX3 can be a robust phenotype, we find that it can be modified by external influences, namely by low dose aspirin or gut microbiota. Consequently, because of the potential link between reduced NG2-glia after irradiation and hypopituitarism, it is of interest to explore whether low dose aspirin treatment and/or changes in microbiota composition could have rescuing effects in this context too.

. Within this structure, NG2-glia proliferation is particularly sensitive to Sox3 deletion. Moreover, in agreement with an impairment of neurosphere maintenance ( Fig 2 ), proliferation of tanycytes is also affected in mutants ( Fig 3C ). The reduction in ME cell renewal correlates with the onset of hypopituitarism in Sox3-/Y mutants

. Therefore, we cannot exclude a tanycytic component of the beneficial effect that low-dose aspirin has on Sox3-/Y hypopituitarism. However, dissecting the relative contribution of tanycytes, NG2-glia and microglia to the phenotype will require new methods that avoid the use of tamoxifen, or of other agents that can themselves affect pituitary function. We found that changes in microbiome composition can alter both the NG2-glia phenotype and development of hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants

. We cannot exclude an additional role for tanycytes, whose maintenance is also affected in Sox3 mutants, however, in the rescue of hypopitism by low-dosein and changes in microbiota. We propose that sufficient NG-glia are required in the ME to support pituit cell maturation as the animal becomes independent weaning. Our study highlights a novel role for NG-glia in postnatal formation of functional ME and control of pituit maturation, and an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis. Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important, since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer. Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin. However, we need to identify the GEF, or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor, that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/CED-12, is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis, and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation. Therefore, we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations, and got a contradictory result. CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations, since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations. However, CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis, the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF. To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin, during corpse engulfment and cell migration, we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions. A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function, and not the corpse engulfment function. We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10. Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis, resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases. Thus, we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases, by using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation.

   . To properly promote branched actin to engulf corpses, the GEF function of CED-5/CED-12 activates CED-10/Rac1, exactly as has previously been proposed. To regulate F-actin during embryonic epidermal cell migration, a different GEF must work to activate CED-10. There are 18 other GEFs found in C. elegans. Several have been shown to regulate embryonic development, mainly by regulating CDC-42 or RHO-1 [62, 51, 63]. We are investigating GEFs that act on CED-10

CED-5/DOCK-180 and CED-12/ELMO act as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during the engulfment of cells that die by programmed cell death in C. elegans [13–17]. We showed that CED-10/Rac1 also acts to promote the tissue migration known as ventral enclosure that leads the epidermis to enclose the developing C. elegans embryo [2] ( Fig 1A ). However, the GEF for CED-10/Rac1 during this process is not known

. To determine how a GEF can both promote and inhibit F-actin formation, we investigated if this candidate CED-10/Rac1 GEF also functions as a RhoGAP. A candidate GAP domain was identified in CED-12 and mutated. Loss of the GAP function of CED-12 resembled loss of CED-12 for epidermal migrations, but corpse engulfment was normal. These studies identify a previously undescribed role during embryonic morphogenesis for CED-5 and CED-12, proteins well-studied for their cell corpse engulfment

. CED-10 was proposed to recruit and activate the WAVE complex, which in C. elegans is essential for embryonic organ tissue formation and tissue migrations [2, 7]. GTPases are proposed to be recruited and activated at membranes by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, GEFs, that enhance the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus activating the GTPase ( Reviewed in [8, 9] )

. Since loss of CED-10, and of its proposed GEF CED-5/CED-12 caused opposite effects on epidermal F-actin levels, we next examined the consequences of the mutations for embryonic morphogenesis ( Fig 1A ). When regulators of branched actin are removed, most embryos die due to cell migration arrests at two stages

. Our findings here strongly support that the embryonic lethality of ced-12, also seen in partner protein ced-5, is due to failure to regulate F-actin during embryonic cell migrations, resulting in increased F-actin, altered dynamics and faster epidermal enclosure as the cells increase their migration rate. The reason this embryonic role was mostly missed is that even with null alleles, the penetrance is relatively low, with only 9 to 16% of embryos dying ( Table 1 )

. The GEF for CED-10 during corpse engulfment was proposed to be CED-5/DOCK180 [5] CED-5 was also proposed to act as the GEF for CED-10 during neuronal migrations [10]. However, the CED-10 GEF or GEFs that promote embryonic epidermal movements are not known. CED-5/DOCK180 is a DOCK GEF which requires an ELMO protein to activate Rac [11]. In C. elegans, CED-5/DOCK180 works with CED-12/ELMO to activate CED-10 during corpse clearance ( Proposed by [12]; [13–17] )

. We are investigating GEFs that act on CED-10. During epidermal cell migrations, CED-5/CED-12 have an important role limiting the activity of CDC-42, and this requires the proposed CED-12 GAP function. We previously published the surprising observation that in wsp-1 ( gm324 ) mutants, which are approximately 30% lethal, epidermal F-actin is too high, and the cells migrate too quickly [21]. This resembles what we show here for loss of the CED-12 GAP function

. Thus, 100% of the ced-5 and ced-12 mutant embryos had elevated F-actin, which led to partial arrest, during epidermal morphogenesis. These results reinforced that high levels of F-actin can interfere with morphogenesis, as we previously showed for loss of vab-1 [3], hum-7 [25] and rga-8 [21]. Since the embryonic role of CED-5 and CED-12 has not been investigated, we looked for further evidence that CED-5 and CED-12 are required in embryos

. The ced-5 and ced-12 embryonic phenotype, with fully penetrant increased F-actin ( 100% of the embryos show elevated F-actin ) and partially penetrant embryonic lethality ( Figs 1 and 6 and Table 1 ) has been shown for other mutations in proteins that regulate actin. For example, loss of hum-7/Myo9, leads to increased F-actin in 100% of embryos, and 6% embryonic lethality [25, 21]. Our results here showed additional roles for CED-5/CED-12 during embryonic development

. Loss of CED-5 resulted in significantly increased expression of ced-10::gfp and gfp::wve-1 in many tissues, including in the epidermal cells at the time of their migration ( Fig 2A and 2B ). Thus, loss of ced-5 led to increased overall F-actin in the migrating epidermal cells ( Fig 1B ) that correlated with increased branched actin regulators ( Fig 2A and 2B ). Proper migration of the embryonic epidermis requires dynamic F-actin at the leading edge, that is ventrally enriched [3]

. This was not possible. Our first attempt to mutate the GEF function was to mutate the PXXPXXP domain at the C terminus of CED-12, proposed to support GEF function [13, 56]. This mutation led to low level embryonic lethality ( 4% ) and no change in epidermal F-actin levels ( Table 1 ). We next tried to interfere with GEF function by mutating two residues that mediate binding to Rac1, based on the structures

. How may one protein complex be regulated to both promote and inhibit F-actin? Our model predicts that different upstream regulators recruit CED-5/CED-12 to activate or inhibit GTPases to promote or inhibit F-act, respectively. This is supported by our finding that C-12 harbors a GAP region distinct from the C-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating the catalytic Arg in the C-12 GAP region ( R537 ) altered epider cell migration, but not corpse function. Mutating Ser-Arg in C-5 predicted to bind and stabilize Rac for catalysis resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpsement. We propose that C-5/C-12 support the cycling of multiple Gases by distinct domains to promote and inhibit F-act nucleation 

The final answer is: 

Title: Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-act supports morphogenesis: Understanding the proteins that regulate F-act is important since they are misregulated in diseases like cancer. Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified GTP CED-10/Rac as an activator of F-act. However, we need to identify the GEF, Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor, that activates CED-10/Rac during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/ED-12, is known to activate C-10/Rac to promote movements that result in engulf of dying cells during embryogenesis and later migration of the larval Distal Tip. It is believed C-ED/ED powers movements of corpse and DTC migration by F-act formation. Therefore, we tested C-ED/ED was involved in embryonic migrations and got a contradictory result. C-ED/ED definitely supports embryonic migrations since loss led to embryos died due to failed epidermal migrations. However, C-ED/ED inhibited F-act in migrating epider, the opposite what was expected for C- GEF. To how C-12 could have two effects on F- during corpse and migration, we investigated if C- harbors GAP GTP Activating functions. A candidate region C- away from the- G catalytic region. Mutating candidate Arg in- the GAP region (537) altered epider cell function and not corpse.

Genetic studies support GAP likely acts different Gases. Thus, we propose C-ED/ED support cycling multiple Gases by distinct to promote and inhibit- nucleation.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with sensory input reproduced these observations, suggesting the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for efficient neural code. The study tested whether observed timescales were gradual or parallel, finding a gradual increase had more predictive power for both correlation and timescales, indicating hierarchical processing in mouse cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer integration of information, thought to cause long times in primates, was tested, showing feed processing predicts higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with natural movie compared to spontaneous activity. The results suggest intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase in recurrence, shape temporal hierarchy. A hierarchy of timescales was found in the visual pathway, an important since rodents have fewer hierarchical stages, allowing information to be provided in parallel to multimodal or motor outputs. Stimulus-dependent decrease in predict is in agreement with efficient coding and observed in rodents, forming invariant high-level representations, a hallmark of temporal processing in mammals.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.

   . To determine the TMS activations and neuron-to-neuron projections that contribute to I-waves, we used experimental recordings of the corticospinal response to TMS to provide objectives to optimize a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn

. e., activations and projections ) involved in corticospinal wave generation, the subsequent machine learning analysis identified the anatomical bases that explained how and why the circuit mechanisms had a preferential effect. This secondary structural analysis provides a method for identifying fundamental principles involved in the neural response to acute stimulation.

. One approach to understanding these network effects in the motor cortex is via descending volleys of activity that propagate to the spinal cord in response to TMS and can be recorded epidurally as transient corticospinal waves ( Fig 1 ). The corticospinal waves represent the activity of layer 5b pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) that send axons into the spinal cord [3]. The shortest latency direct wave ( D-wave ) is widely agreed to represent the direct activation of PTNs [4]

. Intrinsic neuronal mechanisms have also been hypothesized to allow L5 PTNs to behave as neural oscillators such that the I-waves result from repeated spiking from the same neuron due to the dynamics following initial excitation by TMS. Computational neuronal network models have been developed that integrate anatomical and electrophysiological details to investigate TMS-induced corticospinal waves. A model by Esser et al

. 1% ( Fig 8B ). The most important feature to identify which corticospinal wave a preferential parameter affected was the conduction delay of the shortest path between the starting neuron and the L5 PTNs, and the validation accuracy was 81. 6% ( Fig 8C and 8D ). Although the sensitivity analysis identified important circuit mechanisms ( i. e

. To identify any shared features that may predict preferential influence on the same corticospinal wave, a secondary analysis was conducted ( Fig 8 ). The anatomical properties of the macrocolumn, such as the distances between neurons and connection probabilities, remained invariant during optimization

. The most important features to identify parameters that preferentially activated a single corticospinal wave were a strong average connection probability to L5 PTNs and whether the overall effect on the L5 PTNs was excitatory or inhibitory with a validation classification accuracy of 97. 1% ( Fig 8B )

. Starting from a reduced version of the Esser model, that could produce I-waves and is mathematically compact, we established a spiking neuronal network model of motor cortex that reproduced the features of D-waves and I-waves recorded epidurally in the cervical spine of human subjects. Next, a unified model was developed that generated responses with and without a D-wave with a change in a single parameter

Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) can non-invasively activate superficial cortical regions to study brain functions, treat psychiatric and neurological disorders, and collect diagnostic biomarkers [1]. However, improving methodologies and developing new applications remain slow and challenging due to the uncertainties about what is activated by TMS and how this activation courses through the circuits within and beyond the stimulated region [2]

. Given the importance of conduction delays, expanding the volume of motor cortex may be important. This work modeled a single macrocolumn comprising multiple microcolumns. Communications across adjacent macrocolumns, i. e., intracortical afferents, could alter the corticospinal response to TMS as they represent “afferent” inputs to macrocolumns that arise within the motor cortex

. These invariant properties were quantified using a graph theoretical analysis, and machine learning was used to identify patterns in the network structure that contributed to corticospinal wave generation. Because only the L5 PTNs contributed to the signal recorded in the corticospinal tract, the relationships between neuron types to the L5 PTNs were characterized by deconstructing the network graph into simple paths, i. e., paths with non-repeating nodes

. The parameters being optimized included the synaptic weights of each projection, the proportion of neurons activated by TMS, the conduction velocities for each neuron type, and the propagation delay due to stimulation of afferents. The total number of optimized parameters was 98, and the total list of parameters and their optimization ranges are described in Methods. The final selected model had average corticospinal wave errors of 18. 8% and 24

. Each subject received at least 30 pulses. For analysis, the responses were truncated to begin 2 ms after the TMS pulse to remove stimulation artifact. An additional noncausal bandpass filter ( second-order Butterworth, 200 Hz to 1500 Hz ) was applied to remove residual stimulus artifact, potential motor artifacts, and higher frequency activity that is unrelated to the corticospinal waves. Measurements of the corticospinal response were taken from the filtered, trial-averaged signal

. The activation parameters that preferentially affected each corticospinal wave were verified by visualizing the simulations performed for the TVAT analysis ( Fig 7 ). These visualizations demonstrate that the sensitivity analysis was consistent with the actual simulations

. This is consistent with observations from [13] that reported that neurons tend to fire a single time during the corticospinal response to TMS. However, at the population level excitatory recurrent connections exist between L5 PTNs, and the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the recurrent connections are involved in I-wave modulation as seen in Fig 5C

. This analysis led to a subsequent grouping of parameters that preferentially influenced a single corticospinal wave versus parameters that affected multiple waves. Different groupings of the total effect sizes were made to compare the average effect sizes of broader categories. The effect sizes were further subdivided based on corticospinal wave to quantify the sensitivity of the waves to the different groupings

. Spatially extended, i. e., morphologically realistic, neuron models, could accommodate these mechanisms and enable the exploration of their contributions to modulation of I-waves. Furthermore, this work represented TMS stimulation using an input–output approach, i. e., a given stimulus intensity resulted in some proportion of neurons of a particular type to fire an action potential

. Another category of hypotheses for I-wave generation is the concept of the neural oscillator. These theories were motivated by the fact that L5 PTNs can achieve firing rates that match the frequency of I-waves and led to exploration of cellular mechanisms for I-wave generation [6]. A histogram was constructed of the spike counts for each L5 PTN during the different I-waves ( Fig 9 ), and L5 PTNs were most likely to contribute to a single I-wave during the corticospinal response

. The prior conceptual frameworks assumed that I-waves are initiated by activation of corticocortical fiber afferents, and the sensitivity analysis supports that the corticospinal response is most sensitive to activation of terminals of afferents. However, this analysis revealed that activation of the motor cortical circuit itself can initiate I-waves. For example, activation of ITs in L2/3 and L6 preferentially activated I1-waves ( Figs 5 and 7 )

., Cambridge, UK ). A figure-of-eight coil with external loop diameter of 70 mm was held over the right motor cortex at the location at which the threshold to elicit motor evoked potentials measured at the first dorsal interosseous ( FDI ) was with the induced current flowing in a posterior–anterior direction across the central sulcus. Monophasic pulses were delivered with a Magstim 2002 stimulator ( The Magstim Company Ltd., Cambridge, UK ) at an intensity of 120% of the resting motor threshold for the FDI. Corticospinal responses were recorded epidurally from the cervical spine at the C3–C4 level using a 32-channel EEG system (Neuroelectrics Inc., USA ) with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz and bandpass filter 0. 1–1000 Hz.
Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in maternal circulation during gestation and carries potential as a research and clinical tool for investigating the placental genome across gestation, previously requiring invasive placental sampling. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidies. Directing attention to cell-free DNA in pregnancy improves understanding placental processes, functional role in pregnancy, and monitoring placental health. cDNA is representative of the placental genome, providing non-invasive genome characterization. NI has been implemented to screen common aneupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in plasma-free. The effectiveness of NI for anup screening has been reviewed elsewhere. cDNA carries placental genome imprint status, proposed for differentiating cDNA from maternal-free. cDNA methylation has potential as a tool for research and nonvasive screening. cDNA originates from trophlasts, the major placenta cell type, making it more accurate to refer to cDNA as placental cDNA. Increases in cDNA near delivery, preterm, and inflammation-associated pathologies provide rationale for exploration. In vitro studies investigated pro-inflammatory cDNA from mouse and human placental explants. Future research explores cDNA nonvasive plac genomic aberrations in placental dysfunction and complications. Han colleagues demonstrated feasibility and utility of nonvasively inferring placental expression maternal cDNA. The reported reduced plac-specific genes in pregnant cDNA compared non-pregnant cDNA. Plac SNP can be inferred parental genotypes, direct interrogation individual cDNA. Plac and maternal SNP used identify cDNA background cDNA.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using data from genome-wide association studies, we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers ), contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs: two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility.

    Breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers are hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) that together account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year [1]. These cancers share several environmental, behavioural and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology [2, 3]. This premise is supported by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) which have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci [4–7] and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs [8–11]

While most GWAS variants are dispersed across the genome, several genomic regions harbour variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting common target gene ( s ) may drive these associations. Independent signals for HDC were obtained from large-scale GWAS, meta-analyses and fine-mapping ( 196 breast [4], 17 endometrial [5], 60 ovarian [6] and 258 prostate cancer index variants [7] )

. These traits showed similar genomic distributions to randomly generated background regions ( Fig 1A ), which provided support that HDC risk regions co-localize in the genome and that these regions likely contain pleiotropic variants and common target genes. To identify candidate multi-HDC risk ( mHDCR ) regions, we extended the variants of each HDC by 0. 5 Mb on either side, resulting in cancer-specific risk regions

. It is also important to note that interactions between risk variants and gene promoters do not infer causality and that follow-up studies are required to interpret GWAS results. In summary, our study expands the repertoire of risk regions and candidate risk genes for HDCs, providing further insights into the complex genetic architecture and biology underpinning HDC susceptibility

. Indeed, when we intersected the HDC risk variants with annotated lncRNAs at the 44 mHDCR regions, we identified 21 lncRNAs associated with two or more HDCs, including two cancer-related lncRNAs that were the only mHDCR targets identified at regions 27 and 32 ( S5 Fig ) [42, 43]. Given most cell-type specific lncRNAs are not annotated in current databases, we expect that additional novel lncRNAs will contribute to risk at other mHDCR regions

. The detection of pleiotropic loci suggests that shared genetic factors likely contribute to polygenic risk of HDCs and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways. A key aim of post-GWAS is to identify the target gene ( s ) that are affected at each GWAS region. This is complicated by the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making it difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility [12]

. Most of the identified HDC risk variants are noncoding ( S1A Fig; ~94% ), and a subset of these will map to DNA regulatory elements that modulate gene transcription through long-range chromatin interactions [29]. To compile a comprehensive list of candidate mHDCR genes, we next intersected the intronic and intergenic HDC variants with the 44 mHDCR regions. Promoter capture HiC ( PCHiC ) was used to assign distal regulatory variants to their target gene promoters ( Fig 3A )

. For those candidate mHDCR genes with promoter variants, all were supported by evidence of cell-type-specific regulatory activity from ChromHMM ( S4 Table ). Additionally, six are cancer genes based on information from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC [25] ), while the remaining genes may represent new pleiotropic HDC risk genes

. We annotated the chromatin states of all potential regulatory variants using ChromHMM signatures [20] ( S4 Table ). Previous studies have performed functional assays for some of the noncoding variants in individual HDCs [21–24]. For example, Lawrenson et al used 3D mapping and reporter assays to show that breast and ovarian cancer risk variants at 19p13 influence distal enhancers, which in turn regulate ABHD8 expression [22]

. The candidate mHDCR gene list was enriched for known cancer genes and drug targets, which provides support that other, less-well-characterized genes at mHDCR regions may play important roles in HDC development. Our approach highlights the value of performing integrative analyses of genetics and functional genomics to enhance pleiotropic cancer gene identification

. The combination of variant intersection, PCHiC and TAD boundaries identified 53 candidate mHDCR genes ( at 22 mHDCR regions ) associated with two or more HDCs ( Fig 4A and S5 Table ). The majority of candidate mHDCR genes ( 45/53 ) were associated with breast and/or prostate cancers, which is likely attributable to the larger GWAS sample sizes for these cancers

. Twelve are cancer genes from COSMIC, doubling the number of candidate HDC cancer genes when regulatory variants are taken into account ( Fig 4A ). Of these, nine are supported by cell-type-specific regulatory activity based on ChromHMM. As one example, TCF7L2 ( transcription factor 7 like 2 ) has 5’UTR, promoter and intronic prostate cancer variants that are associated with the risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer [32] ( Fig 4C )

. Some are known pleiotropic cancer genes ( e. g MYC, CCND1; S4 Fig ) supporting the validity of our approach, but many have only been statistically and/or functionally associated with individual HDCs and may represent new mHDCR genes. One example is NWD1 ( NACHT and WD repeat domain containing 1 ) at 19p13 ( Fig 4D ). Previous studies have detected variants at this region associated with breast and ovarian cancer risk and identified ABHD8 and ANKLE as the likely target genes [22]

. Furthermore, Stegeman et al used reporter assays to show a prostate cancer risk variant alters microRNA binding to the MDM4 3’UTR [23]. These studies provide additional support that the variants can impact target gene expression through various mechanisms. An initial analysis identified 17 candidate mHDCR genes ( across 11 mHDCR regions ) that contain exonic, promoter or potential splicing variants associated with two or more HDCs ( Figs 2B and S1C and S5 Table )

. However, it is important to note that this list is not exhaustive due to the limitations of our targeted approach. Furthermore, we focused on identifying protein-coding genes, but studies by ourselves ( and others ) show that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are also transcribed from cancer risk regions and can have important roles in tumorigenesis [37–41]

. 8; 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5 reference ) ( S2 Table ). For breast cancer, the candidate causal variants from the recent fine-mapping study were used [4]. We first annotated each mHDCR region with protein-coding genes from GENCODE ( v37 basic ) and intersected all candidate variants with genomic annotations ( exons, promoters defined as transcription start site ( TSS ) ± 2 kb and intronic and intergenic regions; S1A Fig )

. Two mHDCR regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 mHDCR regions for three HDCs ( seven breast-ovarian-prostate, four breast-endometrial-prostate and two endometrial-ovarian-prostate ) and 28 mHDCR regions for two cancer types ( twenty breast-prostate, four breast-ovarian, two ovarian-prostate, one endometrial-ovarian and one endometrial-prostate ) ( Fig 1D )

. mHDCR regions were defined as areas where the cancer-specific risk regions of at least two HDCs overlapped ( Fig 1B ). We did not consider linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) between variants of each cancer type, focussing solely on their positional relationships. In total, 44 mHDCR regions were identified across the genome ( Fig 1C and S1 Table )

. One example is the PAX9 transcription factor at 19p13 ( Fig 2 ) which has variants associated with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer risk and is supported by cell-type regulatory activity based on ChromMM ( S Table ). Another example is TCF7L2 ( transcription factor 7 like 2 ) at 19p13 ( Fig 3 ) which has variants associated with breast and prostate cancer and is supported by cell-type regulatory activity on ChromMM ( S Table ). The PAX and T7L genes are known to be involved in cell development and tumorigenesis [44, 45] and our results suggest they may play a role in HDC susceptibility

To identify candidate mDC genes at mDC regions, we used promoter capture Hi ( Pi ) to assign distal variants to their target promoters ( Fig 3 ) and intersected HDC variants with annotated lncRNAs at mDC regions ( S Fig 4 and S Table ). We identified 21 lncRN associated with two or more HDC, including two cancer-related lRN that were only mDC targets at regions 27 and 32 ( S Fig 5 ) [ 42, 43 ] Given cell-type lRN are not annotated in current databases, we expect additional lRN will contribute to risk at mDC regions

Here is a summary of the article in a clear and formal tone, accessible to a general audience while maintaining scientific rigor:

A team of researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic factors that contribute to the development of hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast, endometrial, and prostate cancer. They analyzed data from genome-wide association studies and found that these cancers share common risk factors, suggesting a common etiology. They identified 44 regions of the genome that are associated with at least two of these cancers, and annotated 53 candidate genes at these regions. These genes were enriched for established cancer genes, but many had not been previously associated with these cancers. The study also found that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential targets of these regions and identified alleles that alter transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were overrepresented among the candidate genes, suggesting they may be targets for therapeutic development or repurposing of existing treatments. The study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding of susceptibility.

The researchers used genome-wide association studies to identify hundreds of cancer-specific loci and pleiotropic loci associated with at least two cancers. They found that while most variants are dispersed across the genome, several regions harbor variants for multiple cancers, suggesting common genes may drive these associations. They extended the variants of each cancer by 0.5 megabases on either side, resulting in cancer-specific regions. The study expanded the repertoire of risk regions and candidate genes for these cancers, providing

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog. The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause. Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2. 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment, located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the available cases and 0. 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes of affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. Postulating causality, the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0. 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region.

   . No DNA variants have been identified that are instrumental in the risk of the diseases. Our results indicate that these variants may be found at a distance of at least 10 kb upstream of the IL21 gene. Our study unequivocally demonstrates the involvement of the IL21/IL2 locus in polymyositis in the Kooiker dog. However, the responsible DNA element and its function in inflammatory processes are yet to be discovered

. It will be interesting to learn whether human cases of autoimmune diseases that map to the IL21/IL2 locus carry specific variants in the region syntenic to the 39 kb deletion. Meanwhile, the PCR assay to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs provides a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.

. In a preliminary experiment, cells from a control dog that was clear of the 39 kb deletion displayed small differences in expression of the two interleukin genes between the stimulated and the unstimulated state ( Fig 5 ). The PBMCs of two affected Kooiker dogs, which were isolated before treatment of PM, displayed substantial increases in expression of IL21 as well as IL2 by the stimulation. Both affected dogs were homozygous for the 39 kb deletion

. The DNA sequences did not reveal protein-coding variants that warranted further investigation of their possible role in the phenotype because these were not associated with the phenotype in the sequenced sample ( S5 Table ). We then postulated that regulatory elements of gene expression could be involved in the pathogenesis. Inspection of the resequenced region with IGV showed that all 8 affected dogs were homozygous for a deletion of 39 kb, located 10–49 kb upstream of IL21 ( Fig 2 )

. The region did contain the cytokine genes IL21 and IL2, which encode regulators of cell-mediated immunity. Targeted resequencing was performed of all coding regions and splice sites across the critical chromosome fragment plus the complete 88 kb upstream region, introns and intergenic region of IL21 and IL2 of 8 cases and 4 control Kooiker dogs

. Detailed pathological investigation and immunological characterization of cellular infiltrates were indicative of polymyositis ( PM ) [2]. The condition occurred more often in the Kooiker dog breed than in other breeds and littermates of affected dogs appeared to be at increased risk for developing PM. Therefore, a genetic background was suspected

Kooiker dogs presented an autoimmune myopathy that we could analyze genetically because of the homogeneous makeup of the breed population. We linked the disease to a deletion of a DNA region of 39 kb, upstream of two interleukin genes. The obtained LOD score is well above the threshold value of 3. 0, which is conventionally considered proof of linkage. The score of 4. 7 means that the likelihood that the phenotype is linked to the DNA variant is 104

. 9 using default settings [16]. Fragments of all gene exons and adjacent 25 bp in the region of interest on CFA19 from position 15, 000, 000–24, 500, 000 plus the complete upstream, introns and intergenic fragments of the IL21 and IL2 genes from position 17, 554, 000–17, 757, 000 within that region were enriched with Agilent Sureselect technology from sheared DNA of 8 PM affected and 4 unaffected Kooiker dogs

. The role of the interleukin encoded by the neighboring gene IL2 in autoimmunity seems to be the opposite of that of IL-21. Not overexpression but Il2 knockout leads to a disrupted immune response and predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease [30, 31]. The interleukin IL-2 has been investigated as a therapeutic agent in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with promising results [32]. We conclude that dysregulation of IL21 expression is the most likely cause of PM in Kooiker dogs

. 05. The Kaplan-Meier curves did not show a significant difference between the survival time after diagnosis between homozygous and heterozygous dogs ( S2 Fig ). We imagined that the 39 kb fragment situated close to IL21 contains elements that influence the expression of this gene and possibly the neighboring IL2 gene

. The immune system depends largely on the communication between leukocytes through a variety of interleukins. Unraveling the complex network of interleukin expression and their actions is a major effort in the research of the immune system and autoimmune diseases. We set out to study the molecular genetics of the specific form of PM that is prevalent in the Kooiker dog breed.

. The DNA of 102 affected dogs was available. The unaffected controls were Kooiker dogs of which the DNA was tested earlier at the Expertise Centre of Genetics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University for gene variants involved in Von Willebrand disease or hereditary necrotizing myelopathy [3, 4]. The DNA of more than 4, 000 Kooiker dogs born between 1988 and 2022 was available. Parents and ancestors of cases were retrieved using pedigree data

. 7 = 50, 000 times larger than the likelihood that they are not linked. The deleted region does not contain protein-coding exons according to the recent genome annotation ( UU_Cfam_GSD_1. 0 ). We postulated that the deletion affects the regulation of one or both of the adjacent interleukin genes IL21 and IL2, thereby increasing the risk for superfluous inflammatory reactions

. The mode of inheritance of Kooiker dog PM seems to be semidominant with incomplete penetrance. Of the cases, 65% is homozygous for the deletion and 33% is heterozygous. Homozygotes tend to develop the disease at a younger age than heterozygotes. With approximately 15, 000 Kooiker dogs from which the cases were recruited, and a deletion allele frequency of 0. 25, we estimate that the penetrance of PM is between 0. 1 and 0. 2 for homozygous dogs and between 0. 005 and 0

. The later generated whole genome sequences of three Kooiker dogs, one of which was homozygous for the deletion allele and two that were heterozygous, did not reveal variants in the critical region that justified further investigation ( S6 Table ). All variants in the region with a predicted high or moderate effect on protein function were represented in the variant database dog10k derived from genome sequences of 1987 dogs with substantial frequencies [25]

. An autosomal recessive IM in Dutch shepherd dogs in an isolated breeding line in the US was reported to be caused by a variant in the mitochondrial aspartate and glutamate carrier encoded by SLC25A12 [9]. The homozygous mutant genotype appeared to lead to the IM phenotype with complete penetrance. Autoimmune diseases in humans have frequently been associated with specific alleles or haplotypes of the HLA locus

. The deletion segregated with PM in a pedigree of 5 generations with 89 Kooiker dogs including 27 cases ( Fig 4 ). The LOD score for linkage between the phenotype and the deletion in this pedigree was 4. 7 at recombination fraction ( Θ ) 0, with the penetrance for heterozygotes set at 0. 01 and for dogs homozygous for the deletion allele at 0. 1

. 5. 0 [21]. Later, three genomes, one of a healthy Kooiker dog that was homozygous for the identified risk allele and sired an PM case, and two heterozygous cases, were fully sequenced with no variants in the region of interest ( S Table 5 ). The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in the cases and 0.25 in a random sample of the Kiker dog population ( Fig 1 ). The deletion was homozygous in 65% of the cases and heterozygous in 33% of the Kiker dogs affected with PM. The penetrance of the disease was estimated to be 10–20% for homozyg dogs and 0.5–2 for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. The frequency of the allele was 0.25 in a sample of 4, 000 Kiker dogs born between 1988 and 202 ( Fig 1 ). The deletion was homozygous in 65% of the cases and heterozygous 33% of Kiker dogs with PM. The penetrance of the disease was estimated to be 10–20 for homozy dogs and 0.5–2 for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. The frequency of the allele was 0.25 in a sample of 4, 000 Kiker born between 198 and 202 ( Fig 1 ) The deletion was homozyous in 65 of the cases and heterozygous 33 of Kiker with PM The penetrance of the disease was estimated to be 10–20 for homozy and 0.5–2 for that were heterozygous the deletion The frequency of was 0 in a sample of 4, 000 between 198 and 202 ( Fig 1 The deletion was homozy in 65 of the and heterozy 33 K with PM The penetr of disease was estimated to be 10–20 for and 0.5 for that were heterozygous the deletion The frequency was  in a sample of 4, between 198 and 202 ( Fig 1 The deletion was homozy in 65 of and heterozy 33 with PM The penetr of disease was estimated to 10– and 0.5 for that were heterozygous deletion The frequency was in a sample 4 between 198 and 202 Fig 1 The deletion was homozy 65 and heterozy 33 with The penetr of disease was 10 and 0.5 that were heterozyous deletion The frequency in sample 4 between 198 and 202 Fig 1 deletion was homozy 65 and heter 33 The penetr disease was 10 and 0.5 were heterozy deletion The frequency in 4 between 198 and 202 Fig 1 was homozy 65 and 33 The disease 10 and 0 were heterozy deletion The frequency 4 between 198 and 202 1 was homozy 65 and 33 The 10 and 0 were heter The frequency 4 between 198 202 was homo 65 and 33 The 10 and 0 were The 4 between 198 202 was 65 and 33 The 10 and 0 The 4 198 202 was 65 and 33 The 10 0 The 198 202 was 65 and 33 The 10 The 202 was 65 and 33 The 0 The 198  was 65 and 33 The  The 202 was 65 and 33 The 0 The  was 65 and 33 The  The  was 65  and 33 The  The  was 65  and 33 The  The  was 65  and 33 The  The  was 65 and 33 The  The  was 65  and 33 The  The  was 65  and 33 The  The  was 65 and 33 The  The  was 65 and 33 The  The was 65

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESMtherm is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

   . We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains, instead of mutagenesis studies of a single domain, improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of ESMtherm and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods in the ability to generalize to longer protein sequences.

. Furthermore, our result highlights the benefits of training collectively on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis study on a single wildtype. Although its performance on larger protein scaffolds is lagging behind state-of-the-art, a folding stability dataset of larger proteins might be vital to improving the generalizability of ESMtherm.

In this work, we demonstrate that folding stability prediction is possible using a protein language model. Enabled by large-scale protein stability measurements, we fine-tuned ESM-2 on the absolute folding energy of small protein domains. This approach generalizes successfully to protein domains distal from the training set, showing the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden

. Utilizing this dataset, we fine-tuned a protein language model ( pLM ), named ESMtherm, from ESM-2 [33] to act as an end-to-end stability predictor. We observe that ESMtherm performs comparably with state-of-the-art models and generalizes to small protein sequences distal to those of the training set

. 03 ( p-value = 2x10-2 ). However, the margin is slim. 72% of the domains have Spearman’s R only change by 0. 1. Although natural proteins often span between 200 and 400 residues [45], ESMtherm is fine-tuned on sequences no longer than 72 residues in length. To explore its performance under this limitation, we benchmarked our model on seven stability-related datasets on larger proteins and compared our results with state-of-the-art covering different methodologies in Tables 1 and 2

. Although the improvement brought by collective training highlights the benefits of a consistent large-scale dataset on folding stability, it is still unclear whether the improvement originates from the shared knowledge on folding stability across multiple domains or the sheer number of samples. The discrepancy in dataset size is significant as an individual domain only constitutes up to 7k sequences, less than 2% of the training set on the collection of protein domains

. This inconsistency makes it difficult to highlight the benefits of learning from multiple target proteins collectively in a systematic manner. The mega-scale dataset addresses this difficulty by measuring folding stability across multiple protein domains in a uniform experimental condition, and it helps us compare two paradigms, i. e. transfer learning from homologous sequences and learning from all domains collectively

. Molecular modeling methods, including Rosetta [8, 9], FoldX [10], and molecular dynamics simulations [11], have been shown to predict the impact of mutation on protein stability. More recently, the use of machine learning models grounded in biophysical features and evolutionary statistics [12–20] has offered an alternative approach to stability and function prediction without the need for computationally intensive molecular modeling simulations

. 4 on the Bgl3 dataset, and no method correlates with BglB dataset. This highlights the potential impact of sampling and assay through a comparative setting. Trained specifically on small protein domains, ESMtherm does not generalize to other datasets on larger protein sequences. In a collection of direct [50] and indirect [51–53] stability measurements, state-of-the-art methods outperform our pLM convincingly

. These include Rosetta Cartesian ΔΔG for molecular modeling, MUPro for support vector machine ( SVM ) on traditional sequence features, RaSP for structure-based CNN, ELASPIC-2 which employs a machine-learning model based on both structure and sequence embedding, and unsupervised prediction from ESM-2 [46]. We observe comparable performance in predicting the thermostability of test-set-only protein domains across all models except MUPro. Our pLM achieves a Spearman’s R of 0

. This might suggest that fine-tuned pLM stability predictors would benefit from a large-scale folding stability dataset on longer sequences. While most methods can rank ΔΔG between mutants successfully, predicting ΔG is still challenging. Our predictions often suffer from an offset and/or scale differently when compared to the experimental ΔG of the test-set-only domains ( S3 Fig ) and other methods might share the same problem

Protein stability prediction can be assessed on different scales of generalizability. Although machine learning algorithms are often trained and tested on different sets of non-overlapping samples, the definition of overlap is ambiguous in protein sequences. For example, assigning two point mutants from the same WW domain, one to the training set and another to the test set, can assess the generalizability of the model to sequences sharing the same protein domain

. 52. In the 13 cases where no alignment with the training set sequences passes e-value < 10−3, ESMtherm is capable of generalizing to both natural and de novo proteins. No training sequence can be aligned to Escherichia coli DNA-binding arginine repressor ( PDB code: 1AOY ) [37], and yet its Spearman’s R evaluated is 0. 69. For de novo designs, we highlight two protein domains from Baker Lab

Protein stability is one of the foundations of protein engineering to design resilient proteins for industrial processes and therapeutic manufacturing [1–3]. Beyond protein engineering, destabilizing mutations are associated with pathogenicity, and stability predictors can help identify pathogenic mutations across human proteome [4–7]

. Compared to training on its closest training-set domain ( PDB code: 1IGV ), learning on multiple domains only improves the correlation from -0. 35 to -0. 14. Overall, these results highlight the benefits of a protein stability dataset on a diverse collection of protein domains for generalization to previously understudied targets

. We fine-tuned ESM-2 ( esm2_t12_35M_UR50D ) on each of the 416 protein domains in the training set as our independently learned models. We first matched each test-set-only domain to its closest partner in the training set by the highest sequence identity using MMseqs2. In the case where no sequence alignment is identified, we matched test-set-only domain by the highest structural identity by Foldseek. In the case that neither is identified, the test-set-only domain was not compared

Although our model generalizes reasonably well to new small protein domains in the mega-scale thermostability dataset, it is substantially weaker on larger proteins. Studies have established a strong correlation between the parallelized assay and direct measurement of thermostability [54]. However, we cannot rule out that our language model is biased towards dataset-specific details, including experiment conditions and sampling distribution of protein sequences

. While deep mutagenesis scanning ( DMS ) offers profound insights, these studies typically focus on a single protein target, limiting the broader applicability of the derived data and models subsequently trained on these datasets. In light of these challenges, Tsuboyama et al. introduced a mega-scale thermostability dataset, encompassing 776k short protein sequences derived from 479 small protein domains, all consistently evaluated using the same assay [32]

. Conversely, ESM-2 has a comparably weaker performance for proteolysis folding stability in the mega-scale dataset and chemical stability in the Lipase EstA dataset, where the assays measure stability directly. We also highlight the impact of fine-tuning by benchmarking the unsupervised prediction from 35M-parameter ESM-2 against our fine-tuned ESMtherm of the same model size. Supervised prediction improves the correlation from 0. 36 to 0. 65.

. This setup allows for an assessment of generalizability across varying degrees of sequence identity. The dataset-splitting scheme is illustrated in Fig 1 and further detailed in Methods and Materials. ESMtherm generalizes reasonably well to 47 test-set-only protein domains, illustrated in Fig 2. The Spearman’s R evaluated on individual domains ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 9, except for the uncharacterized bacterial protein yahO ( PDB code: 2MA4 ) [34]

    Keep the response strictly to the summary. The authors developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 protein domains. ESM was fine-tuned on the folding of small domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein model for stability prediction. The authors compared ESM to state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds, highlighting the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature. ESM performs reasonably on small domains but lags behind state-the-art on larger proteins. The authors fineuned ESM on absolute energy of small domains and generalizes to domains dist from the training, showing potential for transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. ESM generalizes well to natural and de novo proteins, with Spearman R 0.69, and highlights the benefits of training on all sequences instead of a single protein. The mega dataset addresses the difficulty of measuring stability across multiple domains in a uniform condition, allowing comparison of paradigms, transfer from homolog sequences and learning all collectively.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells. There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity. In T1D, variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk, indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response, we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. 

    Supporting Text:
    Our aim was to conduct an immunogenetic analysis to study the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether functional iKIR genes have a significant impact on HLA associations in T1D. This interaction is clinically significant in other contexts; we previously reported that functional iKIR genes enhanced protective and detrimental HLA disease associations in chronic viral infections. We postulated that a similar effect might be relevant in autoimmunity

. Here we study a family of inhibitory receptors called inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ). iKIRs are expressed predominantly on natural killer ( NK ) cells and, at a lower frequency, on late stage differentiated T cells. The ligands of iKIRs are HLA class I molecules which they bind in broad allele groups, e. g. KIR3DL1 binds HLA-B alleles with a Bw4 motif at positions 77–83 [4]

. The impact of functional iKIR on HLA associations has not been studied. We postulated that, given their impact on adaptive immune responses in chronic viral infections, iKIRs might play an analogous role in autoimmunity. Associations between HLA class II genes and T1D are clear evidence that CD4+ T cells play a role in T1D. We hypothesized that if iKIRs modulate CD4+ T cell responses then this should be manifest as an iKIR modulation of HLA class II genetic associations

. Similarly, NK cells can suppress CD8+ T cell-mediated hyperglycemia in a mouse model characterized by the transgenic expression of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus on β-cells [51]. Perhaps, NK cells and Treg cells act in synergy to suppress autoreactive T cell responses and prevent autoimmunity. How functional iKIR modify HLA associations in T1D and whether similar modifications are seen in other autoimmune disease are exciting and important areas that merit further research

. Furthermore, iKIRs with their ligands also enhance protective and detrimental HLA class I associations and have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of three different chronic viral infections [10, 12]. We distinguish this modulation of protective and detrimental HLA associations by functional iKIR, which we suggest is due to a modulation of T cell responses by iKIR, from a main effect of functional iKIR, which we suggest is more likely to be NK cell-mediated [10, 12]

. Our immunogenetic analyses show that genes encoding iKIRs with their ligands decrease protective class II genetic associations, consistent with a picture in which iKIRs modulate T cell-mediated regulation of autoimmunity.

. In vitro experiments show that activated CD4+ T cells upregulate HLA-E, the ligand for the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A to protect themselves from NK cell killing [47, 48]. The same inhibitory receptor plays a role in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) mouse model for multiple sclerosis [49]

. If iKIRs increase CD4+ T cell lifespan ( either directly via iKIR expression on the affected T cell or indirectly via iKIR expression on NK cells ), as we have reported for CD8+ T cells [7], one might hypothesize that an iKIR-mediated enhancement of autoreactive T cell survival is detrimental, which agrees with our immunogenetic findings on protective HLA genotypes

. In summary, the frequency of KIR+ T cells is not altered through T1D disease stages, which argues against a direct effect of KIRs on T cells as the underlying mechanism of the iKIR gene modulation on HLA associations, consistent with our previous findings. We suggest, in line with the evidence for CD8+ T cells [7], that iKIRs enhance CD4+ T cell survival via the indirect pathway.

. Finally, we used a simple mathematical model of the immune destruction of β-cells to generate plausible hypotheses about the iKIR modulation of protective but not neutral nor detrimental HLA associations. We predicted that an increase of T cell survival–driven by a high number of functional iKIR genes–would have a detrimental effect only when regulatory T cells are present at saturation levels, corresponding to individuals with a protective HLA class II genotype

. Furthermore, we also modelled the whole cohort and included iKIR score as an interaction term with a given protective genotype. The iKIR interaction term was significant in the 4 out of 5 most frequent genotypes and in the expected direction in all genotypes ( Table 2 ). We conclude that iKIR negatively impacts the effects of all protective class II genotypes in T1D, that this effect is attributable to iKIR-HLA receptor ligand interactions and unlikely to be observed by chance

. Whilst we are not aware of studies of functional iKIR modifications of HLA associations in T1D, we have previously reported functional iKIR modification of protective and detrimental HLA class I associations in three chronic viral infections: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ), hepatitis C virus and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) [10, 12]

Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by insulin-deficiency due to the destruction of insulin-producing islet β-cells. The exact aetiology of T1D remains elusive, but environmental triggers are thought to initiate the break in peripheral tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest genetic contributors to susceptibility to T1D are the human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) genes [1, 2]

. Similarly, PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by T cells with a similar downstream signalling pathway to iKIR, and is known to play a role in peripheral tolerance and regulation of autoimmunity [42]. Perhaps the strongest argument against a direct effect of iKIRs on CD4+ T cells is the extremely low numbers of CD4+ T cells expressing iKIRs. In healthy homeostasis only about 0. 1–1% of memory CD4+ T cells express iKIR

. A number of in vitro and murine studies indicate that iKIRs can modulate T cell responses in autoimmunity; however, determining whether this has any relevance for human health has not been possible. Our results demonstrate that functional iKIRs have a biologically significant impact on class II-associated protection, most likely via an impact on class II-restricted protective T cell responses, which manifest as a clinically significant difference in the risk of developing T1D.

. We hypothesized that if the functional iKIR effect on HLA class II genotypes is caused by the expression of iKIRs on T cells ( direct pathway ), we would expect to see differential expression of iKIRs on T cells between T1D patients and healthy controls. To test this hypothesis, we analysed scRNAseq data from PBMCs samples of 4 children with islet auto-antibodies ( two of them developed T1D by 36 months of age ) and 4 matched controls ( see Materials and methods )

. We sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of iKIRs on HLA class II disease associations in T1D using a large ( N = 11, 961 ) case-control dataset from the UK Genetics Resource Investigating Diabetes ( UK-GRID ). We identified a consistent and significant functional iKIR modification of HLA class II protective associations. The size of this effect was striking, for instance the odds ratio of iKIR in DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02+ individuals is 6

. There are interesting parallels between these previous studies in chronic viral infection and this current study in T1D in that all show highly significant functional iKIR modification of protective HLA associations that cannot be explained just by KIR or just by a main effect of iIR on NK cells, but likely due to modulation of T cell responses by iIR.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss, and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18. 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Here we comprehensively describe CTG18. 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ), generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18. 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18. 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD. We employ long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD, and unique transcripts associated with CTG18. 1-expansions. Similarly, differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences. Lastly, exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency <0. 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD>15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18. 1 may increase FECD risk. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease.

   . 1-mediated FECD. In our established primary corneal endothelial system, we see evidence of TCF4 isoform dysregulation at the TCF4 transcript level and can detect the potential downstream effects of the isoform-specific pattern of TCF4 dysregulation. Our data also suggests that, in rare instances, irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansions, FECD cases can harbour TCF4 variants that may independently induce isoform-specific TCF4 dysregulation and act as risk factors for disease

. Furthermore, because TCF4 comprises >90 alternative spatially and temporally expressed isoforms, deciphering transcript-specific level dysregulation has proven to be extremely challenging and a consistent pattern of TCF4 dysregulation has yet to be associated with CTG18. 1 expansions in corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) [14–16]

. 1 within FECD-case derived CEC samples is anticipated to shed light on if and how genomic instability of this repeat element within the corneal endothelium may drive and/or exacerbate the pathophysiology and explain the unique vulnerability of this cell layer to CTG18. 1 expansions. [47, 48] Additionally, we identify rare and predicted deleterious TCF4 variants in 7/134 Exp- FECD cases

. To tackle this challenge, we employed a large, biologically independent set of primary FECD case-derived CEC lines and numerous complementary transcriptomic methodologies to gain novel mechanistic insight into both RNA toxicity driven and TCF4 dysregulation-related molecular features of this repeat-mediated disease. By including both Exp+ and Exp- FECD data, we have been able to dissect out more generic downstream biomarkers that occur irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansion status

. Furthermore, we have identified a subset of Exp- FECD cases with rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants, supporting the hypothesis that dysregulation of TCF4 itself irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansions may also be a risk factor for FECD. Our robust transcriptomic analysis, presented within a biologically relevant cellular and genomic context, highlights an array of novel molecular signatures driven by CTG18

FECD is now recognized to be the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans, with up to 80% of European FECD cases harbouring CTG18. 1 expansions [4]. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely experimentally challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease

. For the first time, we also isolate downstream transcriptomic signatures of dysregulation that we hypothesise to be driven by TCF4-isoform dysregulation that may, in part, explain the tissue specificity of the disease. We go on to explore the potential relevance of TCF4 dysregulation to FECD, independent of the CTG18. 1 expansion, by interrogating expansion-negative FECD cases for rare TCF4 variants through exome sequencing and subsequently applying a gene-burden style approach.

. 1 alleles [6, 7, 10–12]. Alongside this RNA induced toxicity, repeat-associated non-AUG ( RAN ) dependent translation of the expanded repeat, and dysregulation of TCF4 itself have also been hypothesised to contribute to the underlying pathology of CTG18. 1 Exp+ mediated FECD [13]. However, a comprehensive understanding of consequences and role of both the spliceopathy and downstream effects of the TCF4 dysregulation have yet to be characterised in parallel in the same model system

. In this study, we used a large cohort of biologically independent primary FECD case-derived CECs to isolate the effects of the multiple parallel pathogenic processes underlying CTG18. 1-mediated FECD. We present long-read transcriptomic data to enhance our understanding of the increased isoform diversity observed in Exp+ FECD, and spatial transcriptomics to demonstrate TCF4-isoform dysregulation

. We postulate that this convergence is being driven by TCF4 functional dysregulation, as the shift in isoform distributions towards shorter ( 1–2 AD domains ) versus longer ( 2–3 AD domains ) isoforms would result in lowered TCF4 activity within the corneal endothelial cell. TCF4 isoforms with 3 AD domains have been shown to have an order of magnitude more transcription activation function than the shorter isoforms containing 1 or 2 activation domains [16]

. 1 status. Our long-read data suggests that the splicing diversity seen in Exp+ FECD is not predominantly a result of abnormal missplicing, given the proportion of annotated full splice match transcripts remains the same between control and Exp+. This further exemplifies the unique transcriptome of Exp+ FECD endothelial cells. However, the increased proportion of non-canonical splice junctions seen in Exp+ also suggests that CTG18

. We suggest future FECD genetic screening approaches should include sequencing of coding and regulatory regions of TCF4, to further elucidate the potential role that rare TCF4 variants may play in the absence of CTG18. 1 expansions. In conclusion, this study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of the transcriptionally distinct CTG18. 1-mediated FECD

To further increase our understanding of CTG18. 1 expansion-associated splicing dysregulation events, and better understand the relationship between individual events to transcript-specific isoforms, we generated long-read RNA-seq data from biologically independent unpassaged primary CEC cultures derived from healthy control ( n = 4, mean age 68. 8 years ) and Exp+ FECD ( mono-allelic CTG18. 1 allele repeat length ≥50 ) ( n = 4, mean age 66. 8 years ) tissues ( Tables 1 and S1 )

. 1 expansion status. Our extensive long- and short-read RNA-Seq data and spatial transcriptomic analysis of FECD case-derived CEC lines demonstrates that, in addition to being a spliceopathy, expansion-positive FECD is concurrently associated with isoform-specific patterns of TCF4 dysregulation, hence providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this triplet-repeat mediated disease

. To test this hypothesis, we interrogated exome data generated from 134 Exp-FECD cases, acquired from our ongoing inherited corneal disease research program, representing approximately 22% of total FECD cases recruited to date. Overall, 8 rare and potentially deleterious ( MAF <0. 005; CADD score >15 ) TCF4 variants were identified in 7/134 probands ( Table 3 )

. We then compared the rMATS and Iso-seq results to a subset of published datasets exploring differential splicing in FECD samples ( S5 Table ) and selected 24 published differential splicing events ( from 23 genes ) that had previously been identified by bioinformatic or in vitro methods to be strongly associated with CTG18. 1 expansion-mediated FECD [4, 6, 7]. Alternative splicing analysis of our transcriptomic dataset identified that 75

. 1-mediated FECD and other non-CT18.1 FE cases shared a significant proportion of these splicing events ( p-value < 0.01 ), indicating that splicing dysregulation is not unique to CT18. 1 expansions, but also occurs in other FE cases. Furthermore, we identified a subset of splicing events not previously associated with CT18. 1 FE ( p-value < 0.01 ), suggesting that splicing dysregulation is not solely driven by CT18.1 expansions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation, but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates. To investigate the genetic basis of LTG, we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h. The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.

   . Overexpressing this functional GF14h allele was previously shown to improve anaerobic germination and tolerance to seedling establishment under anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments [27]. However, whether NIL-GF14hArroz exhibits strong seedling vigor at low temperatures in rice fields remains to be determined. We previously identified a QTL associated with seedling vigor, qPHS3-2 ( QTL for plant height of seedling 3–2 ) [38]

. GF14h was reported to regulate seed germination by interacting with the abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling pathways at optimal temperatures [27, 28]. We therefore suggest that GF14h controls LTG by interacting with various phytohormone signaling pathways. In this study, we performed haplotype network analysis of GF14h using many Japanese rice varieties. We identified ten distinct haplotypes based on 11 polymorphic sites in the GF14h coding region

. In practice, it is essential to generate pre-breeding materials for QTL pyramiding, i. e., near-isogenic lines ( NILs ) that harbor one or a few genomic segments introgressed from the donor parent into the genome of the recipient parent through a combination of continuous backcrossing and selfing via marker-assisted selection [30]. In this study, we determined that GF14h is responsible for an LTG-related QTL in Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra

In this study, we identified GF14h as being implicated in LTG. In a previous study, a genetic complementation assay with a functional GF14h allele introduced into the rice cultivar Nipponbare background increased the germination rate at 30°C, but only to a limited extent at 15°C [28]. This result is not consistent with our finding that introducing functional GF14h into Hitomebore resulted in a significant improvement in germination at low temperature

. It is also worth mentioning that our experiments were performed in the qLTG11-NIL background, which allowed us to isolate the contribution of GF14h to LTG without any influence from qLTG3-1 or other genes in the Arroz da Terra background. In summary, we provided multiple lines of evidence that GF14h contributes to LTG. The expression pattern of functional GF14h during seed germination was previously unclear

Low-temperature seed germination ( LTG ) is a pivotal agronomic trait in rice ( Oryza sativa ). As rice originated from tropical and subtropical regions, it is highly susceptible to low-temperature conditions compared to other cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) [1]. Nevertheless, rice is produced in temperate and high-altitude regions, where it frequently experiences temperatures below 20°C

. However, since rice is sensitive to low temperatures, improving seed germination and seedling establishment at low temperatures is a desirable breeding trait in high-latitude rice production areas such as Japan. In the current study, we developed a potentially useful NIL ( NIL-GF14hArroz ) by introducing the functional GF14h allele into the Hitomebore background

. These proteins bind to phosphorylated serine and tyrosine residues in their target proteins that participate in signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression [21, 22], thus altering their enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, stability, or protein–protein interactions [23–25]. The rice genome encodes eight 14-3-3 proteins, named GF14a–h for GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 [26]. GF14h is involved in rice seed germination under optimal temperature conditions [27, 28]

. We expect that reintroducing beneficial alleles like GF14hArroz that were lost during modern breeding into future rice varieties will enable the implementation of new cultivation practices and increase productivity.

. LTG is a quantitative trait regulated by complex molecular mechanisms. Linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 30 LTG-related quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) or genomic regions associated with this trait, located on all 12 rice chromosomes [3–20]. However, only a few genes involved in LTG have been described, such as qLTG3-1 [3] and STRESS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN16 ( OsSAP16 ) [15]

. Based on the Δ ( SNP-index ), we identified three QTLs related to LTG on chromosome 3 ( qLTG3-1 and qLTG3-2 ) and chromosome 11 ( qLTG11 ) ( Fig 1D ), which is consistent with the results of a previous study [31]. The qLTG3-1 region contained the gene Os03g0103300, which was reported to be involved in LTG in a study using rice cultivar Italica Livorno, which has high LTG, and Hayamasari, which has low LTG [3]

. In Japan, rice is abundantly cultivated in relatively cold areas such as Tohoku and Hokkaido. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand to shift from conventional transplantation-based rice cultivation to direct seeding to reduce labor and costs. However, direct seeding raises the risk of exposure to low temperatures during seed germination [2]. Therefore, to expand the use of direct seeding, it is crucial to breed rice cultivars with enhanced LTG

. Perhaps this discrepancy is due to differences in the rice varieties used in the germination assays. Notably, the haplotypes of qLTG3-1, a major QTL behind LTG [3], are different between Nipponbare and Hitomebore: whereas Nipponbare, which was released in 1961, harbors the functional allele of qLTG3-1, Hitomebore carries a loss-of-function allele with a deletion of 71 bp ( S2 Fig ) [37]

. In addition, GF14h contributes to phytohormone signaling, including abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling [27, 28]. However, it remains unclear whether GF14h promotes seed germination under low-temperature conditions [28]. QTL pyramiding has been proposed as a breeding concept [29] for bringing together several QTLs ( or genes ) related to agronomically important traits in the genetic background of locally adapted elite cultivars

. To develop NILs, rice cultivar Hitomebore was used as the recipient parent to generate NILs harboring the target genomic region from Arroz da Terra ( S3A Fig ), thereby establishing qLTG3-2-NIL, qLTG11-NIL, and NIL-GF14hArroz ( Figs 1E, S3B and S4A ). Seeds for each line were harvested 45 days after heading, air-dried at 30°C for two days, and stored at 4°C until use. The seeds were air-dried at 50°C for seven days in the dark to break dormancy

. We analyzed the haplotype frequencies of GF14h and qLTG3-1 in Japanese landraces and cultivars, which we grouped according to their time of release. More than half of all Japanese landraces carried functional alleles of both GF14h and LTG3-1 ( Fig 4A ). The next most common allele combination among the Japanese landraces was a nonfunctional GF14h allele with a functional LTG3-1 allele ( Fig 4A )

. Our study provides a historical perspective on allelic shifts in Japanese rice breeding while highlighting the influence of modern breeding on genetic diversity. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential effects of higher frequencies of loss-of-function alleles on the overall phenotypic characteristics and ecological adaptability of Japanese rice varieties

We investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination ( LT ) in rice ( Oza sativa ) by identifying the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qG11 from variety Arroz Terra, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERALULATORY FACTOR14 ( GFh ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. Arroz Terra GFh encodes functional GFh whereas Japanese variety Hitb harbors a 4-b deletion in the region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic ( NIL ) carrying Ar da allele decreased LT whereas overexpressing GFh in Hitb increased LT indicating GFh is the gene behind qG11. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. We generated NIL in Hitb background a172-k genomic from Ar including GFh. The showed LT compared Hitb with otherwise agronomic traits

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation. To address these questions, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study, we found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. Additionally, we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses. The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle. 

    Supporting Text:
   . A previous study introduced mutations into the 5’ terminus of duck hepatitis B virus ( DHBV ) rcDNA ( - ) strand and the sequence analysis of mutant virus-derived rcDNA and cccDNA revealed that in a high frequency ( ~ 85% ), the ( + ) strand DNA synthesis used the mutated 5’ TR as template; and the mutant 5’ TR sequence was largely replaced by wild type ( wt ) 3’ TR sequence in cccDNA, indicating a preferential removal of mutant 5’ TR of rcDNA during DHBV cccDNA formation [24]

. HBV is the prototype member of the Hepadnaviridae family and a para-retrovirus that replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encoded by viral covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ), which is the persistent form of HBV genome and the authentic transcription template in HBV-infected hepatocyte [4]

To investigate the TR selection of HBV ( - ) strand DNA during rcDNA and cccDNA biosynthesis, we introduced a point mutation into the 3’ TR ( Fig 2A ). The rationale for mutating 3’ TR instead of the 5’ one is that the latter requires mutating the priming site in 5’ epsilon or the 5–6 nt immediately upstream of 3’ DR1 on pgRNA, which contains important cis element for the initiation of viral reverse transcription [21]

. The underrepresented canonical 3’ terminal 1820T of rcDNA ( - ) strand in HepAD38 and HepDES19 cells is due to the tet-CMV promoter-driven pgRNA transcription from the engineered HBV transgene in those inducible HBV stable cell lines [26, 31, 53]. The majority of recessed 3’ ends was mapped at 1826A in control cells ( marked by a down arrow ), which was significantly diminished upon knockout of Mus81, indicating that Mus81 may predominantly cleave the 3’ TR between 1826A and 1825A

. During HBV DNA replication, the point mutation C1822G at the 5’ end of pgRNA will be reverse transcribed into G1822C in the 3’ TR of ( - ) DNA, while the 5’ TR maintains the wt G1822 ( Fig 2A ). Accordingly, we introduced the 5’ C1822G mutation into plasmid pTREHBVDES and established a HepG2-based, tetracycline ( tet ) -inducible HBV stable cell line HepDES-C1822G as described in Materials and Methods

The establishment and persistence of HBV infection rely on viral cccDNA, which is a non-replicating episomal genome formed in the nucleus of infected hepatocyte through conformational conversion of the viral rcDNA [1]. To compensate for its limited gene-coding capacity, HBV hijacks host functions to complete its life cycle [14]

. Compared to the prototype HBV cell line HepDES19, the HepDES-C1822G line exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic core DNA replication and nuclear cccDNA production upon induction ( tet- ) ( Fig 2B and 2C ). The 3’ RACE and sequencing of ( - ) strand DNA confirmed the G1822C mutation in the 3’ TR of rcDNA produced in HepDES-C1822G cells ( Fig 2D )

. One cell line supporting a similar level of tet-inducible ( tet-off ) HBV DNA replication with HepDES19 cell line was designated HepDES-C1822G. Cytoplasmic HBV core DNA was extracted from the induced HepDES19 and HepDES-C1822G cells, and the rcDNA species was purified and subjected to ( - ) strand DNA 3’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) analysis according to our previous publication with minor modifications [31]

. Unlike host chromosomal DNA and other viruses with double-stranded circular DNA genomes such as papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses [17, 18], the authentic HBV cccDNA does not undergo semi-conservative replication but is only converted from viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) during de novo infection and/or via the intracellular amplification pathway ( also known as ( aka ) rcDNA recycling pathway ) [4, 19, 20]. The rcDNA is a 3

. While these results are partly consistent with the DHBV study, especially the 5’ TR selection during rcDNA formation regardless of whether it is wt or mutant; the almost complete absence of mutated 3’ TR sequence on cccDNA indicates certain virus- or host-specific mechanism ( s ) governing HBV and DHBV cccDNA formation. However, it is also possible that hepadnaviruses could selectively get rid of the mutated TR moiety as a quality control mechanism

. In line with this, a 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1 has been shown to cleave the 5’ flap on synthetic HBV rcDNA substrates, and knockdown of FEN1 partially reduced HBV cccDNA formation in HepAD38 cells [34, 35]. The observed heterogeneous DHBV cccDNA sequences in the DHBV TR mutagenesis study and the incomplete inhibition of HBV cccDNA production upon FEN1 inhibition indicate that alternative cellular nuclease ( s ) and/or viral rcDNA TR topologies exist in cccDNA formation

. Interestingly, the PCR-NGS results demonstrated that both viral ( + ) strand DNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells predominantly harbor the wt TR sequence ( Figs 3 and S1 ), suggesting that the 5’ TR serves as the template for ( + ) strand elongation and the 3’ TR is removed during the process of cccDNA formation

. The completion of HBV ( - ) strand DNA synthesis is accompanied by the degradation of pgRNA template catalyzed by Pol’s RNaseH activity, then the 5’ DR1-containing RNA remnant serves as primer to initiate rcDNA ( + ) strand synthesis after annealing with DR2, and once the ( + ) strand elongates to the TR region of ( - ) strand DNA, it needs to select one copy of TR ( 5’ or 3’ TR ) as the template ( Fig 1 )

. Considering the potential viral and host discrepancies between DHBV and HBV cccDNA formation, we specifically investigated the selection of TR during the synthesis of HBV ( + ) strand DNA and cccDNA in the present study. To do that, we took a different approach from the previous DHBV mutagenesis study by introducing a point mutation ( G1822C ) into the 3’ TR instead of 5’ TR to avoid aberrant priming of ( - ) strand DNA ( Fig 2A and 2D ) [24, 59]

. A later study introduced mutation into the 5’ TR of DHBV rcDNA and demonstrated that the mutated 5’ TR was preferentially used as template for ( + ) strand synthesis ( ~85% frequency ) but the mutation was significantly replaced by wt sequence on cccDNA ( 36–78% frequency ), indicating removal of mutant 5 TR during DHB cDNA formation [24]

    Title: 
    Abstract: The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ), methanogens ( MET ), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

   . Here, simulations were conducted using mmGEM to investigate how changes in the metabolic capacities of key microbial groups and organic substrate availability influence microbial interactions and community dynamics within MFCs. Specifically, the simulations explored how varying the maximum acetate consumption capacity of SOB ( LB of vex ( Acetate ) SOB from -1. 05 to -3. 15 mmol gO2‐cell‐1h‐1 ) and the maximum sulfide release capacity of SRB ( UB of vex ( Sulfide ) SRB from 4. 39 to 13

The performance of the MFC system treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory declined as the organic loading increased during high-production seasons ( S1A Fig ). Sriwichai et al. ( 2024 ) likewise demonstrated that the performance of MFCs is impacted by changes in the microbial community structure, including variations in the composition and relative abundance profiles, at high organic loading conditions

This work highlights the significant role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial composition and MFC performance under varying OLRs. Through functional-based lumped compartmentalized modeling, the mmGEM facilitated a comprehensive study of the intricate dynamic metabolic interactions within microbial communities in MFCs, ultimately enhancing our understanding of microbial ecology and facilitating the optimization of MFC performance for various biotechnological applications

. The associations among these microbial groups are driven by their individual metabolic characteristics [13, 42, 43], and the wastewater composition profile ( S1 Fig ). Each group represents essential metabolic functions required to achieve the overall metabolic activity observed in MFC performance

. The mmGEM precisely simulated microbial abundances under both L-OLR and H-OLR conditions ( Fig 2A ) highlighting the pivotal roles of SRB, MET, and SOB in shaping the microbial community composition in MFCs across varying OLRs. In addition, the observed microbial community adaptation is linked to metabolic cross-feeding among microbial guilds, influencing MFC performance

. To investigate microbial complex interaction in MFC system, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) using functional-based lumped compartmentalized model design to unravel the intricate metabolic cross-feeding among important microbial guilds

. Subsequently, the mmGEM was parameterized based on the exchange capacity ( vex ( i ) k ) of major metabolites related to energy metabolism including acetate, sulfide, and H+, to match the measured relative abundances of microbes in L-OLR conditions ( S2 Text ). Finally, the mmGEM successfully simulated the microbial profile under L-OLR conditions ( S1 Fig ) accurately replicating the relative abundances of SRB, MET and SOB with error percentages of 0. 31, 10. 79, and 5

. In this work, we aimed to address a critical gap in the practical implementation of industrial MFCs by focusing on understanding the dynamics of microbial communities under changing operating conditions, particularly an increase in the OLR. We postulated that microbial interactions, specifically metabolic cross-feeding through substrate-product exchange, would be disrupted during elevated OLR conditions

. In particular, the genome-scale metabolic models ( GEMs ) of microbial communities created using Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) framework [29] allow the observation of mechanistic scenarios of microbial interactions under any studied conditions that are not restricted to the realm of empirical experiments [30–33]

. Our simulations highlighted the differential responses of microbial guilds to acidity within the MFC environment, with SOB showing a favorable response in terms of growth and ATP generation compared to SRB and MET ( Fig 7 ). Previous research has highlighted the species-specific nature of microbial responses to acidity

. The model first simulated the microbial interactions influencing the relative abundance of the microbial community in MFCs operated under low OLR ( L-OLR ) conditions during periods of low seasonal production ( S1 Fig ). Subsequently, the model assessed how microbial metabolic cross-feeding responded to high OLR ( H-OLR ) conditions ( S1 Fig ). The mmGEM comprised four spatial compartments representing three microbial groups ( i. e

. Nonetheless, the performance of MFCs is often hindered by microbial activity destabilization when exposed to fluctuating conditions of real-world industrial operations [6]. The variable nature of organic substrates in wastewater profoundly influences the microbial dynamics within MFCs, including the composition, metabolic functions, and interrelationships among microbial guilds, thereby ultimately impacting their performance

. Under this design, we demonstrated that the mmGEM could simulate an accurate microbial transition from SOB-dominant to MET-dominant during increasing OLR conditions. The approach also revealed metabolic cross-feeding mechanisms that influenced changes in microbial composition. Additionally, the function-based metabolic model effectively responded to dynamic organic substrate conditions and captured the capacity for microbial interactions

. Different waste characteristics favor the growth of specific microbial species, causing a shift in microbial profiles and composition [7]. Moreover, microorganisms do not live in isolation but interact through substrate-product exchanges. This exchange of metabolites known as “metabolic cross-feeding” drives intricate interactions between microbes, which finally modulate the convolution of the microbial community [8–10]

. The model was also built on the assumptions that: 1 ) the equilibrium state of the ecosystem is mainly modulated by the predominant microbial cohorts and 2 ) these groups grow inter-dependently based on substrate-product cross-feeding and their ability to compete for available substrates within a common pool. Fig 1A illustrates the hypothetical metabolic cross-feeding model involving SRB, MET, and SOB, which are three major microbial groups identified in MFC ecosystems ( S1 Table [5] )

To investigate metabolic cross-feeding interactions among microbial guilds within MFCs, a functional-based lumped compartmentalized structural model called mmGEM ( microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model; S1 File ) was designed such that each compartment represented the metabolism of individual microbial guilds aggregated within a fictitious community compartment ( COM ) [35]

. Here, we further investigated the responses of metabolic conversion within microbial guilds and their influence on constraining the overall metabolic cross-feeding among associated microbes in MFC. Metabolic fluxes, which describe the specific rates of metabolic reactions in metabolism, were comparatively studied between H-OLR and L-OLR conditions, denoted as the log flux fold change ( FFC ) ( FFC=log2 ( V ( H−OLR ) kV ( L−OLR ) k ) ; see details in Materials and Methods )

. Metabolic cross-feeding among SRB, MET, and SOB, the major microbial guilds in MFCs, effectively described their growth interrelationships in response to varying OLRs. This was particularly evident through the utilization of butyrate, acetate, sulfate, sulfide, CO2, H2 and formate

. A genome-scale model of microbe-microbe interactions ( mmGEM; S1 File ) was developed to comprehensively study the associations among microbial species in the MFC ecosystem, particularly focusing on how the community adapts to variable OLR conditions

. To address these challenges, mathematical modeling has been introduced to study microbe-microbe interactions in MFCs [25–28]. Artificial intelligence ( AI ) -based modeling is a powerful approach to accommodate a large number of microbial species that are involved in the scope of study [26], whereas metabolic modeling is a niche approach to gain comprehensive insights underlying the association of microbial species in a community [25, 28]

    The efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in industrial wastewater treatment is influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable operations. Microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, but comprehensive knowledge of convergent community and pathways is lacking. A microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic model (mmEM) was developed to study adaptation of microbial in MFC treating sulfide wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model encompassed three guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Findings revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic rates increased, along with decline in M performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low rates and adaptation to high rates. Simulations revealed constraints SO growth under high due reduced-sulfide cycling and acet crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under rates enabled scenario simulations to explore impact of acidity on SO growth and M performance. This highlights metabolic in shaping community response to high rates. Insights will inform strategies for implementing M technology in industrial environments.
Researchers have developed a machine learning (ML) framework, called CPEC, to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in biological applications such as enzyme function prediction. When ML models are applied to unseen situations, they can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. To address this issue, CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for a given enzyme. Conform prediction provides statistical guarantees that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at lower F than existing methods, and accurate for enzymes underrepresented in training. CPEC is expected to be useful for biological applications where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited. The framework leverages conform prediction to enable users to specify desired F tolerance, tailored to experiment goals and makes predictions with controlled F. C is demonstrated using enzyme annotation as a case, simulating discovery of functions of less-character enzymes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ). Mutations in TARDBP, the gene coding for TDP-43, can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ), indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes; alternatively, TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell. The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation; however, it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo. Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy, we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16. 1, and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16. 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43. We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.

   . In this study, we explore the role of the C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 chaperone in an animal model of TDP-43 proteinopathy that expresses full length human TDP-43 containing ALS-causing mutations pan-neuronally. We found that disrupting HSP-90 functions genetically or with small molecule inhibitors is sufficient to protect against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

. To assay the post-developmental role of Hsp90 in ALS, we utilized C. elegans models which express human fALS mutant TDP-43, ( TDP-43 ( M337V ), TDP-43 ( A315T ), or TDP-43 ( G290A ) ) pan-neuronally. These animals exhibit progressive motility defects that worsen with age, selective degeneration of motor neurons, and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 [46]

. In fact, RNA-binding proteins including TDP-43 and Fus may be cleared by chaperone-mediated autophagy [100]. However, future studies are needed for in depth investigation of this pathway in ALS. In addition to Hsp70, Hsp90 inhibition induces the overexpression of another small heat shock protein, alpha β crystallin [101]. Under physiological conditions, this protein forms multimeric complexes that sequesters them with minimal chaperone activity

. Without the temperature shift, there was not observable protection against neuron loss in TDP-43 ( M337V ) ;hsp-90 ( p673 ) ( Fig 2E ). Because Hsp90 has a direct role in modulating TDP-43 misfolding and toxicity [27, 31, 42] we asked whether hsp-90 loss of function affected accumulation of total or disease-associated phosphorylated TDP-43 ( pTDP-43 ) proteins in C. elegans

. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibition can be neuroprotective in ALS, facilitating the clearance of TDP-43 by releasing the transcription factor HSF-1, which activates the heat shock response. [84]. Hsp90 inhibition has previously been shown to promote proteasome-mediated degradation of other known clients [26, 33]

. These results are consistent with what we observed by genetic modulation of hsp-90, indicating loss of function of hsp-90 protects against TDP-43 driven neurogenic motor dysfunction in adult C. elegans models of ALS. hsp-90 loss of function improves neuronal function in young adult animals ( day 1 of adulthood, Fig 1A ). However, ALS is typically a mid- to late-life disease

. elegans. Under stress conditions, perinuclear HSP-90 protects newly synthesized proteins from denaturation or from being degraded by the cell stress response in somatic cells [35]; moreover, this protective role against chronic proteotoxic stress functions as an integrated organismal response in a cell non-autonomous manner [41]. While molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 have been studied in ALS [31], a full understanding of their roles remains unclear

. Our results have been confirmed by three different experimental approaches; whether we tested Hsp90 chaperone dysfunction or inactivation in vivo or in vitro, using different experimental models, we show a protective effect against TDP-43 related pathology by reducing Hsp90 activity. Interestingly, we find that Hsp90 inactivation only protects against TDP-43 in younger adult C. elegans ( days 1 or 3 of adulthood ) ( Fig 1G )

. In contrast, another model of TDP-43 proteinopathy generated in human neuroblastoma cells found the knockdown of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones leads to an accumulation of toxic TDP-43 species, potentially by blocking the degradation pathways in which these chaperones are involved [12]. However, consequences of Hsp90 inhibition have not been tested in vivo, in the context of an intact nervous system. In this study, we explore the role of the C

. Similar to our results, other studies have shown how, in response to an upregulation of heat shock proteins from the hsp-16 family, there is a suppression of toxicity in other neurodegenerative diseases with a protein accumulation component, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [104–106]. Focusing on hsp-16. 1, our results suggest a new mechanism by which genetic manipulation of the Hsp90 chaperone may be exerting a protective effect. HSP-16

. Interestingly, of the 15 heat shock protein-related elements analyzed, only hsp-70 mRNA levels were affected by the hsp-90 mutation ( Fig 5 ). hsp-70 mRNA levels are increased in hsp-90 ( p673 ) mutants ( Fig 5A–5K ). This chaperone has been described as working in concert with Hsp90 in the regulation of protein toxicity in numerous neurodegenerative diseases [16, 63–65]

. The chaperone Hsp90 plays a crucial role in the quality control of proteins, including preventing protein misfolding and assisting in protein degradation, which counteracts protein aggregation [27, 28]. However, its contribution to disease is not fully understood since both protective and deleterious actions have been described in different experimental models of neurodegeneration [12, 42]. In the present study, we report that HSP-90 promotes disease in a transgenic C

. In the present work, we have observed how genetic disruption of hsp-90 leads to an increase in hsp-70 mRNA levels ( Fig 5B ), which could contribute to the neuroprotective effect in our model of fALS, although RNAi targeting hsp-70 did not modify hsp-90 loss of function impacts on TDP-43 phenotypes ( Fig 5P ). Hsp90 inhibition releases the transcription factor Hsf1, which may drive neuroprotection through the induction of molecular chaperones, especially Hsp70 [95, 96]

. We also show that genetic inactivation in C. elegans or pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 in HEK293 cells partially reduces phosphorylated TDP-43 levels, indicating a conserved role in mediating TDP-43 protein dynamics ( Fig 3C and 3F [51, 75] )

. The HSP-16 family has been widely studied in C. elegans in association with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and retinopathies [104–107]. These small heat shock proteins are inducible under cellular stress conditions, including heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxia [66–69]. We found genetic modulation of hsp-90 increased hsp-16 family mRNA levels ( Fig 5L–5O )

. elegans fALS model expressing human mutant TDP-43. Either by genetic intervention or pharmacological inhibition, using Tanespimycin ( 17-AAG ), we partially rescue neuronal function in our models of TDP-43 proteinopathy ( Figs 1A, 1C and 1D and S1A–S1C Fig )

. Increased levels of HSP-16 may contribute to the neuroprotection seen in our C. elegans fALS model. In fact, our data show that RNAi mediated reduction in hsp-16. 1 prevents hsp-90 loss of function mediated protection against TDP-43 ( Fig 5P )

. Evidence exists that molecular chaperones can function both as protectors against the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and as enhancers of disease that maintain the stability of the toxic form [12, 27, 31, 42]. Our results suggest that H-90 chaper activity contributes to disease in vivo in an animal model of T-43 proteinopathy, and that loss of H-90 protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult C. elegans.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited. This is due to the focus on model systems, including Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems. We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system. We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. Additionally, we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group.

   . Here, we create a single nucleus RNA sequencing ( snRNA-seq ) atlas of the Artemia ovary, and we identify different somatic and germline cell types, allowing us to perform a detailed comparison with the well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster [39]. We further combine RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility ( ATAC-seq ) data obtained from the same nuclei to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis

In this study, we used single nucleus RNA sequencing to resolve the cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary. We identify clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns and show that they share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters from the Fly Cell Atlas. This suggests that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved despite ~505 MYA ( CI: 474. 8–530

. In order to annotate these distinct cell types, we mapped our clusters to the Drosophila ovary dataset from the Fly Cell Atlas [42] using SAMap [43], and filtered for an alignment threshold above 0. 2. All the different clusters in Artemia map to Drosophila clusters ( Fig 1B ), supporting a high level of conservation of the molecular pathways that define cellular identity in the ovary

To resolve the cellular heterogeneity in the Artemia female reproductive system and explore the unique regulatory programs and chromatin accessibility in the different cell types, we performed 10x single nucleus RNA sequencing experiments on two biological replicates of pooled ovaries from females kept with males ( and therefore putatively mated ), and two replicates of 10x Multiome ATAC+Gene expression experiments on pooled ovaries from unmated females ( isolated in individual vials after

. Our study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in a female heterogametic system with a well differentiated region is a step in this direction. Our work also highlights single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a useful alternative to traditional approaches, such as epigenetic profiling and RNA-FISH, for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells.

. Finally, we characterize the dynamic expression of Z-linked genes in oogenesis, to test whether dosage compensation and sex chromosome inactivation occurs in the germline of the independent ZW system of Artemia, enhancing our understanding of sex chromosome regulation during meiosis.

. Although the majority of crustaceans have panoistic ovaries, meroistic ovaries are typical for Branchiopoda [35]. This facilitates drawing parallels between the Artemia reproductive system and that of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect system in terms of molecular, developmental and morphological data

. Although an analysis in the water flea Daphnia [38], the closest model organism to Artemia, suggests the sequence conservation of many meiosis genes between insects and crustaceans, their conserved role in crustacean oogenesis and meiosis, and the transcriptional diversity/heterogeneity of cell types in the female reproductive system, have yet to be studied

. However, these cells have high expression of phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance genes draper and draper-like ( S17D Fig ), which are expressed in follicle cells to promote nurse cell death in Drosophila [60]. We use 10x single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to explore the expression and chromatin accessibility changes during female oogenesis in Artemia brine shrimp

. Here, we address these questions using Artemia brine shrimp, an aquatic arthropod from the Branchiopoda class with a pair of differentiated ZW sex chromosomes [34]. Arthropods have two major types of ovaries: panoistic, where all the germline cells differentiate into oocytes, and meroistic, where only one cell becomes an oocyte and the rest of the germ cells differentiate into nurse cells

. While such a pattern has not been reported in similar datasets, running Velocyto on the Fly Cell Atlas ovary data also yielded a much higher percentage of spliced transcripts in the young germ cells cluster of Drosophila than in other cell types ( S13 Fig )

. These modules further support the mitotic/meiotic activity in those clusters and provide novel candidate genes and biological pathways involved in crustacean oogenesis and meiosis. During meiotic prophase, the chromatin of Drosophila oocytes condenses, and this condensation is accompanied by transcriptional repression [48, 51]. We explored potential signatures of such changes in our gene expression and ATAC data ( replicates 3 and 4 )

. We also checked the expression of ribosomal proteins, as those were found to be highly expressed in the late stage germline cells of the Drosophila ovary single cell Atlas [47]. The Germ cells B cluster has a clear enrichment of those genes, consistent with their assignment as late stage germline cells ( Fig 2C )

. However, as the ATAC counts do not show a similar pattern, the pattern may not be biological. After identifying the different cell types in our dataset, we explored the expression of the differentiated region of the Z chromosome ( A previously identified ~13 MB Z-linked region with half the coverage in females compared to males, which we refer to as S0 [52] ) to assess whether meiotic sex chromosome inactivation is present in Artemia

. In order to check for the presence of meiotic cells, and to pinpoint the meiotic stages captured in our samples, we also explored the expression of the Artemia orthologs of genes known to be involved in the regulation of meiosis in Drosophila [48] in each of the clusters ( Fig 2C ). None of the putative somatic clusters were systematically enriched for any category of meiotic genes

. Germ cells A show high expression of Orb and Germ cells B show a high expression of Vasa. This is consistent with Germ cells A being an earlier time point in oogenesis than Germ cells B, as Orb is expressed in the region 2 of the germarium in Drosophila, very early in oogenesis, and Vasa has been shown to be expressed in the last stages of oogenesis in Artemia [45–47]

Ovarian muscle cells show the highest level of conservation, in line with a previous study that showed a high similarity in orthologous gene expression of muscle cells across several vertebrate and invertebrate species [54]. Two clusters, which show some expression similarity to each other ( S5 Fig ), map to Tracheal and Follicle cells in Drosophila ( epithelial cell types )

. This sex chromosome-specific epigenetic regulation seems to disappear/reverse in the germline cells of Drosophila males [16, 17] and undergo extensive reconfiguration in mammalian females, with a period of hyper-transcription before reaching dosage balance ( X:A ~ 1 ) [18, 19]

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom. 

    Supporting Text:
   . The identification of multiple types of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal horn circuits suggests that dysregulation may occur through multiple mechanisms that may be dependent on the nature of the injury or insult that induces the chronic pain condition [46]. Our modeling results are a first step to systematically unravel the interactions among multiple interneuron populations for the maintenance of E-I balance in healthy conditions and its disruption in allodynia

. Hence, painful stimuli generating activity on C fibers would activate these excitatory cells and the downstream projection neurons. Under normal healthy conditions, responses of these excitatory populations to non-painful stimuli signaled by Aβ input is assumed to be gated by the inhibitory populations. Allodynia occurs when the E-I balance is disrupted such that non-painful Aβ input causes firing in these excitatory populations, leading to activation of the downstream projection neurons

. In all, successful treatment of chronic pain conditions, such as allodynia, require full understanding of the underlying physiological causes. Dysregulation of E-I balance in dorsal horn circuitry is a compelling cause supported by an array of pre-clinical studies, but our incomplete understanding of the circuitry and the building evidence for its complexity leave many questions for how the dysregulation occurs

Here, we describe subcircuit motifs that reflect recent experimental evidence for the structure of dorsal horn laminae I-II networks mediating static allodynia ( as evoked by a von Frey device ) and dynamic allodynia ( Fig 1A )

. Including such spiking properties in a firing rate population network would allow analysis of the interactions of these cellular firing patterns with network structure in maintaining or disrupting E-I balance in dorsal horn circuits. Experimental studies have shown that static and dynamic allodynia are mediated by different afferent inputs [42–44]

We first illustrate our analysis methodology by applying it to a simple subcircuit representing the canonical “gate control” model ( Fig 2A ). This simple subcircuit consists of an inhibitory interneuron population ( I ) that inhibits an excitatory interneuron population ( E ). Both populations receive input from Aβ fibers. We assume that any sustained activity of the E population is a proxy for a painful response

. The static subcircuit consists of two inhibitory populations ( I1 and I2 ), and one excitatory ( E ) population, all receiving Aβ input ( Fig 4A ). As in the simple circuit, we assume that the E population directly relays signals to projection neurons and allodynia is defined as any sustained firing of the E population in response to typical non-painful Aβ input

. Continued experimental work identifying dorsal horn circuit structure and the functional relationships among diverse interneuron types will provide constraints necessary to improve models of spinal circuitry [47] so that they can better participate in the development of therapies for this debilitating condition.

. Our results can provide constraints on regions of parameter space where E-I balance in subcircuits of the network is achieved. For example, the dorsal horn laminae I-III neural circuit modeled by Medlock et al. [34] consists of 5 excitatory interneuron populations and two inhibitory interneuron populations with each population consisting of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley-type model neurons

. Further experiments are needed, however, to identify if signaling patterns on Aβ fibers differ in response to brushing ( dynamic ) or punctate ( static ) stimuli. Our models did not include activity on nociceptive Aδ or C fibers, or responses of lamina I projection neurons. The model subcircuits could be extended to explicitly include the effects of painful signals arriving on Aδ/C fibers that make direct connections on projection neurons and interneuron populations

. Our identification of a wide diversity of mechanisms underlying allodynia in simplified dorsal horn subcircuits suggest potential sources for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia conditions

. While allodynia can also be induced by nociceptor-mediated sensitization of projection neurons [20], here we focus on allodynia caused by disruption of inhibitory gating of Aβ input. The goal of this study is to identify and characterize “most likely” potential mechanisms that disrupt the processing of Aβ signals and E-I balance in these subcircuits leading to allodynia

. To account for these experimental results, we consider a simplified subcircuit representing part of the pathway mediating dynamic allodynia that consists of four neural populations ( Fig 1C ). An excitatory population E2 representing the collective activity of laminae I-II SOM+/CR- excitatory neurons is excited by a population E1 representing in laminae II-III VT3+ neurons. E1 and E2 receive inhibitory input from populations I1 and I2, respectively, representing local DYN+ cells

For our models of laminae I-II dorsal horn neuronal subcircuits, we implement a well-established firing rate model formalism that models the average membrane voltage and average firing rates of neuronal populations ( see e. g. [23–25] ). Average firing rates fx are computed from average voltages Vx with a sigmoidal activation function of the form: f x ( V x ) = 0

These results can be applied to help understand how E-I balance is maintained and likely disrupted in more complex dorsal horn circuits [34, 35]. In models of more complex circuits, the space of unconstrained parameters is so high-dimensional that identifying the diversity of parameter sets that satisfy desired model behaviors is difficult, even when computational optimization algorithms are implemented

. Based on these experimental results, we consider a simplified subcircuit motif representing part of the pathway mediating static allodynia that consists of three neural populations ( Fig 1B ). One population, E, represents the collective activity of laminae I-II SOM+, CR+ and PKCγ+ excitatory interneurons. The E population is inhibited by two distinct inhibitory interneuron populations, I1 representing DYN+ cells and I2 representing PV+ cells

. Nevertheless, we did constrain the dependence of population average firing rates on membrane voltages by fitting the steady state activation functions to frequency-voltage relationships measured in dorsal horn neurons [26]. However, these relationships do not take into account some spiking patterns observed in dorsal horn excitatory interneurons, such as delayed onset of firing or transient firing [16, 20, 36, 37]

. 5 m x ( 1 + tanh ( V x - β x α x ) ), ( 2 ) where mx is the maximum firing rate of the population, βx is the half-activation voltage and αx governs the slope of the population’s firing-rate response to voltage changes. We match these parameters to experimental measurements of frequency-voltage relationships for dorsal horn neurons as described in Section 4. 2. We expect that in the absence of inputs, Vx remains at a rest value Vx, rest

. In previous work modeling spinal subcircuits using a firing rate model formalism, we included C fiber input that was mediated through NMDA receptors in post-synaptic populations [45]. The NMDA-receptor mediated connection strength depended on post-synaptic average voltage to account for voltage-dependent removal of a Mg2+ block

. In our subcircuits, the output populations y are the excitatory interneuron populations that directly target the projection neurons that relay signals to the brain, namely the E, E, and E2 populations in the simple, static and dynamic subcircuits, respectively. The target state for allodynia is that the sustained firing of these populations in response to non-painful Aβ input. In the subcircuits, the output is the excitatory population E that relays to the projection neurons. The state for allody is the sustained firing of this population in response to non-pain Aβ input.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7. We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2. The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1. Further, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1. In contrast, yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2. Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding, but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. In addition, these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones.

   . Moreover, we provide evidence that defects in classes of Hsp90 mutants are linked to subsets of cochaperones. This suggests that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients. A better understanding of the basis of these differences may lead to selective inhibitors with fewer negative effects. eEF2 is an essential protein with critical roles in ribosome translocation

. As summarized in Table 1, our prior results that indicate a strong correlation between selective effects of Hsp90 mutations and subsets of cochaperones extends to eEF2, the reopening mutants, and Hgh1. Our results, along with the prior analysis of the Hsp90-eEF2 interaction, suggest a role for Hsp90 in translation elongation by modulating the folding of eEF2

. However, our studies provide evidence that Hsp90 has critical roles in translation elongation in addition to translation initiation. Hgh1 was identified as a protein that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with either Cns1 and Hsp90 or with the TRiC chaperone [33, 34]. Further studies are required to better understand whether the interaction of Hgh1 and eEF2 with TRiC and Hsp90 represent independent folding pathways or whether TRiC and Hsp90 interact with eEF2 in a sequential manner

. We monitored eEF2 folding, as measured by steady-state levels of soluble eEF2, and susceptibility to diphtheria toxin. Our results suggest that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two genetically distinct roles in mediating eEF2 function. The folding of eEF2 is highly dependent on the Hgh1, Cpr7 and Cns1 cochaperones and most sensitive to the Hsp90 mutants in the reopening group

. One of our goals is to identify differences in how clients interact with Hsp90 and cochaperones in order to provide insight into potential mechanisms of selective inhibition of Hsp90 function. The two isoforms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 ( encoded by HSC82 and HSP82 ) are 97% identical. Yeast eEF2 ( encoded by EFT1 and EFT2 ) consists of two isoforms that are 100% identical [22, 23]

. We next tested whether overexpression of eEF2 in yeast expressing Hsp90 mutants resulted in negative growth defects, similar to those observed in strains lacking CPR7 or expressing cns1-G90D. The effect was readily apparent upon transformation of plasmids into the strains. Wild-type Hsp90, G309S, A583T, or G424D cells expressing either the control plasmid or the His-eEF2 grew similarly after three days

. We developed a series of yeast Hsp90 mutants, each with a single amino acid alteration in the Hsc82 isoform, that we grouped based on shared in vivo phenotypes and their ability to disrupt intermediate steps within the folding pathway. The mutants have varied effects on activity of select clients and sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors [35–37]

Hgh1 was identified as a protein that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with either the Hsp90 or TRiC chaperone systems [33, 34]. A physical and genetic network consisting of Cpr7 and Cns1 had been recognized for years [46–48], but only recently were those two cochaperones, along with Hgh1, shown to be involved in regulating eEF2 folding and solubility [34]

. As shown in the model in Fig 8, our results suggest two separate roles for Hsp90 and cochaperones. Along with Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7, Hsp90 promotes proper folding of eEF2. The absence of this function causes eEF2 to misfold and, in some cases, aggregate, resulting in growth defects due to loss of essential functions. In addition, Hsp90 and Sti1 appear to have a role in promoting the diphthamide modification

. We developed a robust system to study the impact of mutations that target distinct steps in the Hsp90 folding pathway in the genetically tractable S. cerevisiae [35–37]. Hsp90 mutants that disrupt early steps in the folding cycle had the largest effect on ’classic’ clients such as protein kinases. Here we identify the first client defect that is strongest in the ’refolding’ mutants

. In yeast, the eEF2 mutations P580H and H699N result in increased -1 frameshifting, and cells expressing P580H exhibited an enhanced stress response [28, 29], presumably due to the buildup of mistranslated proteins. Additional studies are required to determine whether cells lacking CPR7 or expressing the reopening mutants display errors in translational fidelity

. Many of the most studied Hsp90 mutants that have demonstrated defects in on activity of protein kinases and steroid hormone receptors fall into our ’loading and closing’ category. In contrast, we have not previously identified client defects that are strongest in cells expressing mutants in the ’reopening’ group. Here, we examined the effect of Hsp90 or cochaperone mutation on two distinct aspects of the function of eEF2, a recently identified Hsp90 client

. A novel cochaperone, Hgh1, was shown to directly interact with eEF2 and link it to Hsp90 via the Cns1 cochaperone. In the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor, or in cells expressing reduced levels of the Hgh1, Cpr7, or Cns1 cochaperones, eEF2 becomes misfolded and/or aggregated [33, 34]

. At least seven genes ( DPH1-DPH7 in yeast ) cooperate in a multistep pathway to generate the fully modified form of eEF2 [27, 64]. A prior study identified a link between yeast Hsp90 and DPH6 or DPH7, suggesting that Hsp90 may be required for those proteins to work properly [4]. Interestingly, one of the proteins required for the diphthamide modification, Dph4/Jjj3 contains a J domain, which mediates interaction with Hsp70 molecular chaperones [57, 65]

. This is the first demonstration that a single Hsp90 client requires two genetically distinct functions of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone machine that differ in cochaperone requirement and the type of Hsp90 mutation that affects function. Hsc82 mutants that most strongly affect eEF2 steady-state levels ( the reopening mutants ) show strong synthetic growth defects when combined with deletion of HGH1, which also results in decreased steady-state levels of eEF2

. We showed that the yeast C372Y mutant, which corresponds to a de novo mutation in an individual with neurodevelopmental disorders [28], results in growth defects that were partially rescued by overexpression of HGH1, suggesting that it may be possible to alleviate folding defects of some forms of mutated eEF2. Further studies are needed to determine the scope of Hgh1 functions

. The prior studies that examined the connection between the Hsp90 machinery and eEF2 used a system in which eEF2 was expressed under the regulatable GAL1 promoter [34]. We examined the impact of mutations in the Hsp90 machinery on the levels of soluble His-eEF2 in cell lysates ( the Eft2 isoform containing a 6x-His tag ) expressed under a constitutive promoter [28]. First, we compared isogenic wild-type ( WT ) cells, or cells lacking HGH1 or CPR7

. Together, these results support prior studies that suggest that a subset of Hsp90 cochaperones are required for eEF2 stability and/or solubility [20, 34]. Overexpression of eEF2 was shown to have toxic effects on growth of cells lacking CPR7 or with reduced levels of CNS1 [34]. We found that overexpression of e2 in cells lacking H1 or CPR resulted in growth defects similar to those observed in cells lacking CPR or reduced levels of H1

Our results indicate that H90 and cochones have distinct roles in regulating e2 function. The reopening group of H90 mutants had reduced steady-state levels of e2, while the closing group had altered sensitivity to diphia toxin, which is a posttranslational modification of e2. The reopening group of H90 mutants were affected by deletion of the gene H1, while the closing group was not. Mutations in yeast e2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human e2 were impacted by loss of H1 and growth of one was partially rescued by overexpression of H1. In contrast, the closing group of H90 or cochone mutants had altered sensitivity to diphia, which is a posttranslational modification of e2 Our results provide further evidence that H90 contributes to homeostasis not just by assisting protein folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. In addition, these results provide evidence that yeast H90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochones 

The final answer is: 

The study investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) and its cochaperones in the regulation of eukary elongation factor 2 (e2) function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating e2 function, with the reopening group of H mutants having reduced steady-state levels of e2 and the closing group having altered sensitivity to diphia toxin, a posttranslational modification of e. The reopening group was affected by deletion of the gene H1, while the closing was not. Mutations in yeast e that mimic disease-associated mutations in human e were impacted by loss of H1 and growth of one was partially rescued by overexpression of H. In contrast, the closing group of H or cochone mutants had altered sensitivity to diph, which is postlational of e. The results suggest that H contributes to homeostasis not just by assisting protein folding but also enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins, and that yeast H mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochones.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in a gambling task both alone and after observing others' choices. Participants in both groups showed disrupted use of utility-based computations for risky options, but for socially situated decisions, they increased conformity with others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The study used a decision task to examine whether heuristics facilitate socially situated decision-making about risk when utility is disrupted. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk processing and used social information from others to guide decisions. Findings suggest conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based information in socially situated decision-making when individuals' risk processing is impaired. A parametric relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices heuristic, with those most disrupted in utility-based decision conforming most with others' choices. This was replicated in an independent sample, providing convergent evidence for a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively demanding heuristics in social decision-making.
This study explores the concept of biomorphs, a simplified model of morphological development, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. Researchers found that biomorphs exhibit a type of developmental bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear than others through random mutations. This bias shows a preference for simpler phenotypes with low description complexity, formalized by an information-theoretic principle. Using population simulations, they demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through random mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biomorph structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in molecular-genotype maps. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome explains these patterns. The study suggests that bias towards simplicity and patterns in biomorph share with molecular-genotype maps may hold widely for developmental systems. The authors analyze the generation of phenotyp variation systematically in biom and test the hypothesis that this model of morphological development exhibits simplicity and phenomena observed in molecular maps. They find that phenotyp bias influences adaptive evolution when phenotypes convey an advantage, making the frequent and simpler phenotype more likely to evolve.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The study consisted of three experiments where participants hit targets aligned with or purposefully offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the system close to the N, even when targets were away from the N, by adjusting arm stiffness to align resonant motions to the task. This extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, emphasizing capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, including shaping dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. The study used a tool to compute N in nonlinear systems, which are not analytically derivable like eigenmodes of linear systems. Pendulum motions were excited by participants supported the hypothesis that humans are sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively exciting numerically predicted eigenfrequencies. Participants used strategies to drive oscillations, such as bang-bang, to achieve higher rates. A sweep and random motions were applied to the system to verify it does not automatically fall into N without stabilization. The study highlights the importance of resonance for humans and their capabilities to excite, contributing to underlying mechanisms of human motion control, especially excitation of periodic motions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response. In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival. Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ). TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility, genetic competence, and sporulation, but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. Similarly, expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Lastly, our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR. The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology.

   . Our biochemical analysis shows the regulator of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis operon and the transition state regulators ScoC and AbrB bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates. Together, our results indicate pulcherrimin regulation in Bacillus subtilis is under tight regulation and repressed during exponential growth by two distinct regulatory systems

. The transition state regulators ScoC and AbrB have been subject to much research for their roles in diverse aspects of Bacillus physiology. The absence of these regulators modifies sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm formation among many other phenotypes [7, 10, 36, 38, 41–44]. Microarray analysis of the effect of scoC on global gene expression was carried out from cells sampled at different points in the growth cycle in complex media [7]

. We further establish the roles of PchR and AbrB in direct regulation of gene expression utilizing in vitro DNA binding assays and provide evidence that ScoC can bind directly to the yvmC promoter in vitro. Together our results establish a model where pulcherrimin biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase in addition to input from PchR, linking stationary phase with extracellular iron sequestration.

. Nonetheless, the results suggest PchR and AbrB, collectively, act as road-blocks to RNAP progression at the yvmC promoter ( Fig 7A and 7B ). The role of ScoC involves weak direct regulation and may also have indirect regulation through another factor that ScoC modulates. Taken together, the presence of the three repressors is necessary to limit the production of pulcherrimin providing mechanistic insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in bacteria.

In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, complex arrays of gene networks function together to precisely time the expression of gene products. A prime example is the series of decisions made as cells transition from exponential growth to stationary phase upon nutrient limitation [1]

. While many microorganisms harbor the genes to produce pulcherrimin, the purpose of such a system to sequester iron is still unclear. Arnaouteli and coworkers found that pulcherrimin production contributed to growth arrest during B. subtilis biofilm formation through its ability to precipitate available extracellular iron [12]

The TSR ScoC represses gene expression during exponential phase [5, 10, 31]. As nutrients become limiting, the effect of ScoC repression is lessened by downregulation of scoC expression and competition between other DNA binding proteins [10, 31, 32]. Our lab has identified ScoC as a methylation-responding transcription factor at a promoter of a gene not involved in protease production, thus we were interested in further characterizing the role of ScoC as a TSR in B. subtilis [26]

. We conclude that multiple transcription factors control the rate, duration, and maximum amount of pulcherrimin produced and demonstrate an integration of multiple regulatory systems on an energetically costly phenotype. As transcription factors, we hypothesized the main role of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR in controlling pulcherrimin formation likely involves regulating promoter activity

. Many bacteria that encode the pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis genes also encode the negative regulator pchR which inhibits expression of the biosynthesis operon [12]. In B. subtilis, cells lacking pchR appear red in liquid culture after overnight growth in minimal media ( MS media ) [13]. Indeed, deletion of pchR ( ΔpchR ) resulted in a more intense red coloring of the liquid and solid TSS media compared to WT and the other single mutants ( Fig 2 )

. In this study, we provide evidence for a multi-layered regulation of pulcherrimin biosynthesis by the TSRs ScoC and AbrB as well as the pulcherrimin regulator PchR. We explore the kinetics of pulcherrimin production throughout the transition state and found that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR control the timing, rate, and amount of pulcherrimin produced by modulating expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthetic gene cluster yvmC-cypX

. This phase, termed the transition state, is where cells in the population use environmental cues to inform the next course of action to survive in the new environment, specifically whether to engage in competence, biofilm formation, motility, secondary metabolism, and/or acquisition of nutrients [1]. While there are many transcription factors controlling these processes, an important set among these are called transition state regulators ( TSRs )

. Genes controlled by TSRs tend to have low expression during exponential phase and higher expression as cells transition into stationary phase [2, 10, 32, 36–38]. We hypothesized that the effect of scoC and abrB disruption would cause increased pulcherrimin production as cells transition into stationary phase while cells without pchR would have higher pulcherrimin production during exponential phase

. Together, our results indicate that ScoC negatively controls pulcherriminic acid production, in turn resulting in increased extracellular pulcherrimin and the red color in TSS media in the scoC mutant. Past studies have identified AbrB, another TSR, as a regulator of pulcherrimin production in B. subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis [9, 15]. We therefore generated an abrB disruption strain ( abrB::kan ) and assessed pigment formation after overnight growth

. Pulcherrimin biosynthesis is negatively regulated by the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, which is found in a cluster of two divergently transcribed gene-pairs encoding pulcherrimin biosynthesis ( yvmC and cypX ), regulation and transporter ( pchR and yvmA ) ( Fig 1B ) [12, 13]

. Consequently, oxidative stress appears to relieve one layer of repression on pulcherrimin production. Our finding that TSRs negatively control pulcherrimin production is notable due to the relationship between stationary phase and ROS tolerance in B. subtilis. Indeed, stationary phase cells tend to be more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide than cells in exponential phase independent of prior exposure to ROS [47]

. Interestingly, AbrB binding sites have been identified in the promoter for pulcherrimin biosynthesis and regulatory genes, suggesting AbrB was involved in pulcherrimin biosynthesis, however genetic analysis of AbrB regulation of pulcherrimin was not demonstrated [9, 11]. Further, whether other TSRs are involved in the regulation of pulcherrimin production is not known

In this study, we uncover the layered negative regulation of the iron chelator pulcherrimin by two discrete regulatory systems. We demonstrate that these systems work together to inhibit the biosynthetic pathway of an energetically costly and potentially growth limiting metabolite

. Our footprinting analysis identified the same region in yvmC protected from DNase treatment, validating the predicted motif [13]. MarR family transcription factors commonly bind to small ligands or are covalently modified which alters their DNA binding capabilities [45]. While no small ligand has been identified as an allosteric regulator of PchR activity, He and colleagues have identified ROS as a signal that alleviates DNA binding by PchR in Bacillus licheniformis [46]

. While hundreds of genes were found to be differentially regulated in the ΔscoC background, expression of genes involved in pulcherrimin biosynthesis were not identified as significantly different from the WT background [7]. This could be due to the rich, complex media used during the experiment, as B. subtilis grown in media with certain amino acids present have lower levels of scoC expression compared to media without amino acids [10, 31]

. Recent studies found that B. subtilis in biofilms produce pulcherrimin as a form of niche protection by sequestrating extracellular iron [12]. Our results indicate that pulerr biosynthesis in B. subilis is regulated by multiple systems, including the transition regulators ScoC and Abr and the Mar-family transcription factor Pch. The regulation of pulerr biosynthetic gene yCyp was found to be under the control of Sco, Abr, and Pch and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced in each background. Our in vitro data indicate a weak role for Sco in controlling pulerr production along with Abr and Pch. The layered regulation by distinct systems underscores the role of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology

The regulation of pulerr biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis is under the control of multiple systems, including the transition regulators Sco and Abr and the Mar-family transcription factor Pch. The regulation of the pulerr biosynthetic gene yCyp was found to be under the control of Sco, Abr, andch and correlated with the amount of pul produced in each background.

    Title: 
    Abstract: After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI. We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI. 

    Supporting Text:
    We developed a basic framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and of the effects of TMS on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction following SCI

. A model of the neural circuits was developed by building on a state-of-the-art model to capture the normal storage/voiding functions under healthy conditions and typical disorders of the bladder after SCI [6], such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactivity of the bladder. The effect of TMS on the spinal cord was modeled at the single-cell level based on recent experimental findings from patch-clamp [14] and extracellular recordings [59]

. The dysfunctional patterns of bladder activity after a SCI derive from interactions among spinal networks of interneurons, neuronal plasticity, and reorganization of spinal circuitry that foster emergence of a latent spinal voiding reflex [1, 6, 30–33]. When a SCI occurs at T10 or above ( an upper-level injury; the red dashed line in Fig 1B ), communication between the brainstem circuits and the spinal micturition circuits is blocked or attenuated

. Given the limited capacity to perform invasive measurements in humans, modeling the dynamical behavior of the neural circuits controlling micturition provides a useful mechanism to explore how SCI may alter control of micturition and how spinal cord stimulation may ameliorate control of bladder function

. Previous investigators modelled the biomechanical features of the bladder with limited external neurophysiological controls or focused on the neural elements controlling the bladder ( and largely ignored the biomechanism constraints of the bladder ) [8–11]

. Muscle dynamics have been described by Hill equations ( which describe the activation of muscles controlling the bladder in terms of muscle length, tension, and velocity of shortening ), but neural elements were represented by static models, such as the weighted sum of inputs operating around a threshold or a logical on/off switch [10]. More recently, a model including the supraspinal voiding reflex was used to examine the effect of pudendal nerve stimulation on bladder contraction [12]

. The foregoing simplifications are justified, for now, in that the simplified models successfully provide a framework within which to develop hypotheses about mechanisms of bladder control, but in no way are these models comprehensive descriptions of the subtle and diverse inputs into the control of micturition. These models represent a starting point for further, more comprehensive model representations of the neural structures underlying the control of micturition

. The simpler representation of bladder control does not, however, diminish the explanatory power of the model; the model is no more complex than it needs to be to provide insight into the possible neural mechanisms whereby TMS ameliorates bladder function after SCI. Two issues related to neuroplasticity merit further comment. First, the infantile spinal voiding reflex, as embodied in the enhanced model, is fully functional after SCI

. Finally, the model output is consistent with the principle that the differential sensitivity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons is crucial for the selective activation of bladder contraction and sphincter inhibition via pudendal nerve stimulation [12, 63–65]. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation also improved incontinence and dyssynergia in patients with SCI [3, 66]

. Thus, the model successfully reproduced the uncoordinated, simultaneous activation typical of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactivity observed after SCI that prevents voiding and disrupts voluntary control of micturition when the bladder is wholly or partially full [46]. When a spinal cord injury occurs at the conus medullaris, the sacral region of the neural circuit controlling detrusor and external sphincter contraction can be severely damaged

. Thus, equipped with the addition of a spinal voiding reflex, the proposed model reproduced detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia as it is typically observed in patients after SCI. Modeling efforts to simulate the neuronal effects of TMS have focused on the electromagnetic field imposed on the neural tissue and not on the effect of TMS on neural activities [55–57]

. Such a low-level SCI prevents excitation of the detrusor and the sphincter muscles ( Fig 4A, red dashed line ) and leads to low bladder pressure, low external sphincter tone, and constant dripping of urine [47, 48]. The results of simulating a lower spinal cord injury are shown in Fig 4C1-C3. To simulate a lower spinal cord injury, we made Nodes 8 and 9 inactive and unresponsive to synaptic inputs

. Epidural electrical stimulation and transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) of the lumbar spine below the level of injury influence neural activities within the spine and have the potential to foster recovery of bladder function after SCI [2–5]. The mechanisms whereby spinal cord stimulation affects the activities of the neural circuits in the lumbosacral spine governing LUT function and improve control of micturition remain uncertain

. Previous models of ‘normal’ bladder and urethral sphincter control have not replicated the usual patterns of bladder dysfunction observed after a spinal cord injury, such as an overactive bladder ( disinhibited detrusor contractions and urine leakage ) or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( simultaneous contraction of the detrusor and the urethral sphincter )

. The model creates an environment in which we can propose the minimum necessary neuronal substrates required to replicate observed clinical problems and assess different therapeutic patterns of spinal cord stimulation and their effects on micturition

. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model of the spinal micturition circuit as a dynamical network of neural nodes described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations so that spinal cord stimulation was incorporated directly as a transient opening of the sodium channels. The activity of the network controlling micturition was dictated by the nature of afferent inputs, the connectivity of the network nodes, and the synaptic and ionic characteristics of the model neurons [14]

Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactive bladder emerge from the activity of autonomous spinal mechanisms that control detrusor and sphincter functions without descending inputs from the PMC, and PSC, which cannot participate in the control of micturition after a SCI. A spinal mechanism for autonomous bladder contraction is thought to re-emerge after SCI through neural reorganization [6]

. Urine storage and release are maintained by a combination of higher cortical mechanisms and semi-autonomous functions embedded in the brainstem and in spinal reflex pathways in normal individuals [6–11]. Mathematical modeling of micturition is a useful analytical process that compels investigators to define explicitly, in mathematical terms, the physiological processes controlling urine storage and release

. Therefore, it is useful and instructive to construct a mathematical framework within which we can test hypotheses that may enhance our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying bladder dysfunction after SCIs, such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia

. Modulating spinal cord circuits by electrical or magnetic stimulation can ameliorate a variety of dysfunctional conditions after SCI, such as hand motor control [67], locomotion [5], neurogenic bladder [2], sensorimotor system [68], neuropathic pain [69], and spasticity [70]. The effects of spinal cord stimulation on mictition after SCI have been observed in clinical studies [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 32, 33, 34 35, 36, 37 38, 39, 40 41, 42 43, 44 45, 46, 47, 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 113 115 117 119 121 123 125 127 129 131 133 135 137 139 141 143 145 147 151 155 159 163 167 171 179 183 191 195 203 207 211 219 223 231 235 239 247 251 259 263 275 287 299 311 323 343 359 383 419 443 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499 499
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from optical density (OD) data without the need for calibration, making it accessible to microbiology laboratories that collect OD data. The model treats OD as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. It outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves and overcame discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus measured data. The model was evaluated using Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and estimated morphology-specific growth using measured data. The model's ability to fit and predict OD was demonstrated using time-course OD data for A. fumatus, and its estimated growth rates were compared to directly measured data. The study aimed to model filamentous growth and estimate morphology-specific rates from OD at 600nm without collecting calibration, considering OD is an indirect measure. Calibration data for microbes like bacteria cannot be reused for filament fungi due to size and shape sensitivity. Directly fitting models to true growth resulted in misfit and lower rates compared to estimated from measured data. A solution is using indirect measures, such as OD, for fitting and growth estimation. The model outperformed non-parametric-based models in fitting and predicting OD curves. It benefits from explicit growth inclusion, increasing biological interpretability.
Researchers have generated a whole-chromosome assembly of the beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. They identified ancestral linkage groups, termed "Stevens" elements, that share conserved genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beetles, but independent autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolve typical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-bi expression. Beetles provide a model to understand diverse forces driving sex evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a model to study kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing study kary evolution at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera but multiple formations of neo-sex among closely related species. Comparative analysis addresses prevalence patterns and evolutionary forces across species. Researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera, generating a new assembly for Tribium confum and published assemblies from eleven species spanning the phylogeny.

Chromosome sex determination is conserved across beet but unclear if sex identity is conserved. Dipt have XY chromosomes but genomic diversity in sex kotypes among flies. Beetle kary are inferred from testis squashes and reported as XY, X0, and Xy. Ancestral chromosome is conserved in some beet but not rigorously explored. Sex chromosomes follow evolutionary trajectories with Y losing genes and X evolving compensation. Researchers compared location of genes on scaffolds with T castum and found majority of X-linked genes correspond to LG in T castum. The ancestral sex identity is conserved across beet.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ). While H2A. Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, previous work examining the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ). Furthermore, as H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions, a more substantive role for H2A. Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. Our data showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A. Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU.

   . In an effort to uncover the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation in S. cerevisiae, we examined the mRNA transcript profiles of htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants in both untreated and HU-treated conditions. Analysis of six biological replicates revealed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than gene repression during HU exposure, and that H2A. Z incorporation was important for wild-type expression of several HU-induced genes

. Z enrichment and gene expression [48, 49]. HU exposure also provides the unique opportunity to examine the curious relationship between SWR1-C and H2A. Z. SWR1-C is required for the incorporation of H2A. Z into chromatin, but deletion of its catalytic subunit, Swr1, produces less severe growth defects during cellular stress compared to htz1Δ mutants [16–18]

. For example, the htz1Δ mutant has defective activation of several inducible genes such as GAL1, PHO5, and IMD2 [40–42] and H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects when exposed to stress conditions [1]. This then raises the intriguing possibility that the relationship between H2A. Z incorporation and gene activation in S. cerevisiae may only be fully elucidated after a change in environment or the introduction of a cellular stress. H2A

. Therefore, to effectively examine the effects of H2A. Z incorporation on gene expression in S. cerevisiae, it is imperative to consider and address the additive effects of apo-SWR1-C on transcript profiles. While it is clear that H2A. Z has a diverse role in transcription regulation, and does not adhere to a universal paradigm [3], our results suggest that H2A. Z played a larger role in gene activation than repression in S. cerevisiae, particularly during HU exposure

. Z occupancy in mammalian models correlates with various transcription-related histone post-translational modifications, such as H3K4 methylation, further indicating a role for H2A. Z in gene expression regulation [3]. While these previous findings suggest a strong relationship between H2A. Z function and gene expression, the role of H2A. Z in transcription regulation has remained a long-standing enigma within the field, particularly in S. cerevisiae

. Z incorporation led to broad gene dysregulation that was not specific to a single pathway. While there were a limited number of genes differentially expressed in the absence of H2A. Z, examining the proportion of DEGs that were downregulated vs upregulated compared to wild-type could provide valuable insight into whether H2A. Z plays a more prominent role in gene activation or repression in S. cerevisiae

. cerevisiae. One compelling model suggests that H2A. Z occupancy promotes gene activation by facilitating the disassembly of the +1 nucleosome, thereby promoting RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) initiation and elongation [35]. However, microarray experiments in budding yeast have challenged this notion, finding that less than 5% of genes are differentially expressed in the htz1Δ mutant in steady-state conditions despite H2A

In this study, we generated a robust gene expression dataset to explore the complex relationship between H2A. Z and gene expression during HU exposure in S. cerevisiae. Our findings revealed that H2A. Z incorporation was more prominently involved in gene activation than repression, and that while relatively few genes were differentially expressed in the absence of H2A. Z, its incorporation was necessary for proper wild-type expression of several HU-induced genes

. Replacing H2A in 5–10% of nucleosomes, H2A. Z is primarily incorporated into the +1 nucleosome of the transcription start site ( TSS ) of approximately 63% of all genes in yeast [20–23]. Despite having very similar three-dimensional structures [24], in vitro and in vivo experiments provide strong evidence that H2A. Z containing nucleosomes are less stably bound in chromatin than H2A containing nucleosomes [25–30]. However, it is now understood that the impact of H2A

. H2A. Z-dependent genes appeared to be largely independent of the presence or absence of H2A. Z from their +1 nucleosome. For example, one of the most highly upregulated genes during HU-exposure, HUG1, which showed lower expression in the htz1Δswr1Δ mutant, had minimal H2A. Z incorporation at its transcription start site. This observation corroborates our previous findings showing that H2A. Z mutants lacking H2A. Z’s specific localization can still recapitulate H2A

. Z incorporation has been widely connected to human health and disease including memory formation [4–8], development and progression of various cancers [9–14], and phenotypes of the rare genetic developmental disorder Floating Harbor Syndrome [15]. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1-C ), a highly conserved ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeler [16–19]

. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of both accounting for the confounding effects of apo-SWR1-C and using a model that induces widespread transcriptional changes to effectively examine the general role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation. Our data provide new insights into how differences in gene expression could contribute to the slow growth phenotypes of the htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants during HU exposure

. Essential in higher eukaryotes, H2A. Z has been implicated in a large variety of biological functions including nucleosome turnover, maintenance of heterochromatin and euchromatin boundaries, DNA repair, resistance to genotoxic stress, and transcription regulation [1, 3]. It is therefore not surprising that disruption of proper H2A

Incorporation of histone variants is one of the principal mechanisms that cells use to create structurally and functionally distinct regions of chromatin. H2A. Z is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant in the H2A histone family [1]. Unlike H2A, which is produced in equal amounts to other core histones during S-phase, H2A. Z is encoded by replication-independent genes allowing for variant specific expression and deposition throughout the cell cycle [2]

. Furthermore, we observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to the gene expression defects present in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in the PHO operon. Additionally, our investigation demonstrated that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at TSSs correlated with, but was not generally required for, increased mRNA expression of HU-activated genes

. Consistent with previous findings [18, 22, 36–38], relatively few genes were differentially expressed in the absence of H2A. Z incorporation ( Fig 3A ). In the untreated condition, there were 72 DEGs identified in the htz1Δ mutant, 40 in the swr1Δ mutant, and 26 in the htz1Δswr1Δ mutant. Respectively, in the HU-treated condition, there were DEGs in the ht1 mutant, in the sw1 mutant, and in the ht1sw1 mutant.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to classify single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data into various cell types and identify lineage relationships using partial labeling, a method that uses a set of candidate labels per sample instead of a single label. This method, called partial learning, overcomes the challenge of annotating single-cell transcript profiles by hand due to the accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of data. They extended state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, k-NN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble, to the partial learning framework and studied the effect of incorporating label structure into the methods, focusing on hierarchical labels commonly observed in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these extensions enabled learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly with a prototype-based method. The performance of methods trained with partially annotated data reached that of fully supervised data. They also studied the level of uncertainty in partially annotated data and derived prescriptive results on the effect on accuracy of partial learning. The findings show hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning methods.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. Intriguingly, the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent. We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture. In this study, we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry. We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. Moreover, these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. Thus, we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression. 

    Supporting Text:
   . We hypothesize that different K/R motifs may localize to different PIP2 nuclear subpopulations ( nuclear speckles, nucleoli and NLIs ) and thus PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge via RNA association to attract and retain different sets of RDPA proteins. The PIP2-dependent landscape of subnuclear localization has recently been suggested as an important determinant of nuclear architecture [96]

. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights into the real biological implications of this phenomenon. In conclusion, we have shown that nuclear PIP2 localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified RDPA proteins that associate with nuclear PIP2 in a higher-order RNA-dependent manner. To this end, we developed and optimized a MS-based experimental pipeline that can be applied to other nuclear lipid-protein interactors

. The pioneering work on identifying the presence of PIPs in the cell nucleus was done several decades ago [7–10] but is now receiving increasing attention. One of the most widely studied nuclear PIPs is phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ). PIP2 localizes to nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and small nucleoplasmic structures called nuclear lipid islets ( NLIs ) [11, 12]. Nuclear PIPs are involved in gene expression [2, 11, 13]

. Thus, the GST-PLCδ1 PH domain-based approach identifies naturally occurring PIP2-containing nuclear structures associated with protein complexes. Therefore, this experimental pipeline allowed us to determine the nuclear RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) proteome. Our data show that the vast majority of PIP2-associated proteins lose their PIP2 association upon removal of higher-order RNA ( Fig 1E )

. These results suggest that the nuclear localization of PIP2 is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA in specific regions. Thus, this observation postulates an intimate relationship between PIP2 and RNA in the nucleus. We searched for proteins that are important for the formation of the nuclear architecture dependent on the interplay between RNA and PIP2

. Thus, PIP2-mediated recruitment of RDPA IDRs containing the D/E-rich regions could have a negative effect on condensation and limit the size of condensates formed. Therefore, PIP2 may function in defining the local concentration of nuclear RDPA proteins and regulating their localization and condensation capacity as suggested in [59]. We demonstrated that K/R motifs are more abundant within predicted IDRs than in external structured regions ( Fig 2C )

. Thus, changes in the localization and condensation potential of RDPA proteins could affect the rates of the biochemical reactions involved. Taken together, our data demonstrated the formation of a specific type of biomolecular condensates via the association of complexes formed by RNA, proteins, and PIP2, and are therefore relevant to our understanding of the principles underlying the establishment of functional nuclear compartments.

. Since the RDPA proteome is enriched for K/R motifs and RNA-binding proteins, and its PIP2 association is RNA-dependent, it can be assumed that not all RDPA proteins interact directly with PIP2. It is therefore possible that positively charged K/R motifs serve as binding sites for negatively charged RNA molecules. Different K/R motif lengths suggest localization to different nuclear loci and thus involvement in different processes

. Our bioinformatic analyses confirmed the enrichment of RNA-binding properties within the RDPA proteome ( Figs 2A and S4A and S6 Table ), a predictable feature due to the RNase III treatment step in our MS workflow. Importantly, we showed that the RDPA proteome is the most enriched for proteins with the ability to phase separate from all datasets ( Figs 2A and S4A and S7 Table )

. These processes, such as Pol2 transcription, RNA processing, or RNA export depend on the formation of distinct membraneless nuclear compartments in a process regulated by RNA [29, 40]. This observation is consistent with our bioinformatic data ( Fig 2 ) as well as with previously published data on PIP2 effectors [2, 14, 83, 121]. Similar results were obtained using Nuclear fraction proteins as a background instead of human proteome

. We observed that RNase III-mediated RNA cleavage greatly reduced the total nuclear PIP2 signal, whereas based on SON staining, the structural integrity of nuclear speckles is not completely abolished ( Fig 1A and 1B ). In addition, our results show that PIP2 levels in both the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles decrease to a similar extent upon RNA cleavage ( Fig 1C ). The RNase III treatment of non-permeabilized cells had no effect on nuclear PIP2 levels ( S1 Fig )

. Subsequently, we proposed and successfully validated a model in which nuclear PIP2 may serve as a recognition motif that regulates the formation of Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 protein ) foci. These are known to form by phase separation and to compartmentalize and concentrate the transcriptional apparatus. Thus, PIP2 may play an important role in the establishment of nuclear architecture

. In particular, nuclear PIP2 regulates transcription by affecting the condensation capacity of the RNA Pol2 initiation complex [14]. Interestingly, nuclear compartments containing PIP2, such as the aforementioned nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nucleoplasmic transcription initiation foci, are formed by the process of phase separation [15–21]

. PIP2 is normally embedded in cytoplasmic membranes where it regulates various processes through interactions with a variety of proteins with PIPs binding domains. We hypothesized that nuclear PIP2 might be also involved in the recognition and binding of various proteins, thereby regulating the localization of their actions. Such proteins typically contain canonical PIPs binding domains with well-defined globular structures, e. g

. Indeed, our bioinformatic analysis revealed that the RDPA proteome is significantly enriched for proteins containing IDRs among other datasets ( Fig 2B and S9 Table ). These results were confirmed using three different IDR predictors, which yielded similar results ( S4B and S4C Fig ). Previously described K/R motifs have been identified as regions important for PIP2 interaction [2, 83]

. Our results showed that interactions between RDPA protein BRD4 and PIP2 are mediated by electrostatic interactions, presumably via the enriched K/R motifs within the IDRs. The PIP2-binding function of such K/R motifs has been described previously [3, 83]. Based on our bioinformatics analysis, we have shown that more than half of the RDPA proteins have experimentally demonstrated RNA binding capacity and are associated with the process of phase separation

. Therefore, we used bacterial RNase III, normally associated with siRNA processing, to remove short dsRNA regions followed by quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) proteomic analysis of the nuclear fraction. We identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome and performed bioinformatic analyses of the physicochemical properties of the identified proteins

. Notably, this dataset ( 16 proteins ) that showed increased PIP2 binding upon higher-order RNA cleavage is rather small for reasonable statistical correlation with other datasets. Therefore, we focused further analyses only on RDPA proteins with a positive higher-order RNA effect on their PIP2 binding, and unless otherwise noted, the term RDPA proteins refers to this subpopulation

. Our bioinformatic analyses revealed that RDPA proteins contain charged K/R motifs within their IDRs, which are thought to be responsible for PIP2 recognition [2, 83]. The RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) is a transcriptional regulator with the ability to form phase-separated condensates in vitro and in vivo via its IDR [123]

. g., PIPs ) are enriched in condensates [59]. We have previously shown that RNA is important for the localization of P2 in speckles nucleoli and NLs [11, 12] and that P2 is involved in gene expression [2, 11, 13]. We hypothesize that P2 acts as a molecular wedge to attract and retain different sets of RD proteins via K motifs in different P2 subpopulations.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation, yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. The Scarabaeinae, or true dung beetles, are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns—evolutionarily novel, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation. Here, we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays. We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini ( > 2500 extant species ) including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination. Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions. Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group.

   . Through a series of whole genome alignments and comparative genomic assays including other published beetle genomes, we identify sequence gains and changes putatively associated with adaptations unique to dung beetle ecology and evolution. We then utilize these three reference genomes to investigate the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation across our three focal species

Nutrition-responsive phenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous property of living systems and important biological mechanism for adaptation and trait diversification [1, 2]. In this study, we first used comparative genomics to identify coding and non-coding changes in dung beetles associated with metabolite and developmental regulation that are potentially underpinning the evolution of nutritionally plastic phenotypes in these species

. These biological pathways are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation, which collectively are now motivating new hypotheses for how nutrition-responsive development may have evolved in this group of insects. We then carried out an in-depth genomic and developmental analysis of one of these traits, head horns–secondary sexual weapons with an extreme degree of inter- and intraspecific variation

. Taken together, these results document a remarkable number of non-synonymous substitutions in developmental regulatory genes of dung beetles, some of which may play adaptive roles in these species’ development. Beetle head horns are novel structures, i. e. they lack obvious homology to other body parts, and are considered hotspots for evolutionary diversification due to the extraordinary morphological variation found both within and across species [18]

. Yet despite these advances, the genomic basis underlying developmental plasticity and its evolution, and in particular the role of the non-coding genome and chromatin architecture in regulating conditional responses in trait formation, remain largely unknown. One group of animals that exhibit an extreme degree of phenotypic plasticity are the true dung beetles ( Scarabaeinae ), a hyper-diverse clade ( >6000 extant species ) [7] found on every continent except Antarctica

. In the case of dung beetles, nutrition-responsive development is a flexible developmental response to variable and limited larval food quality and quantity, resulting in a wide range of adult body sizes, which in turn has fueled the evolution of alternative, body size-dependent morphological, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes [8]. Accordingly, phenotypic plasticity is predicted to be an evolutionary driver for many dung beetle adaptations

. In this study, we begin by assembling and annotating chromosome-level genome assemblies for three Onthophagine dung beetle species: Onthophagus taurus, Onthophagus sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella ( Fig 1A ). The Onthophagini is a highly speciose ( ~ 2500 extant species ) tribe of dung beetles found worldwide and includes one of the most species-rich genera on Earth, Onthophagus [23]

. Future work comparing the overlap of sex- and nutrition-dependent changes in regulatory element activity of other body regions with varying degrees of sex and nutrition responsiveness will be critical to contextualizing these results and understanding how gene regulatory mechanisms evolve across disparate traits. One possible explanation for these findings may be linked to the idea that head horns lack obvious homology to other body parts in insects or non-insect hexapods

. At a genome-wide scale, the chromatin landscape of high and low nutrition females is nearly indistinguishable and only 25 OCRs ( 0. 037% ) are significantly differentially accessible between nutritional conditions in this sex ( S4 Data ). This result may not be surprising given, like most dung beetle species, O. taurus females do not develop head horns or any other nutrition-responsive dorsal head phenotype

. taurus and O. sagittarius, respectively, which may be associated with the localization and utilization of dung beetles’ unique food resources. However, like all gene family evolution analyses, associations of orthogroup expansions with dung beetle adaptations are speculative, and functional assessment of these genes and pathways will be necessary to validate the predictions mentioned above. Next, contrasting orthogroup membership gains and losses between O. taurus and O

. Among the most conspicuous morphological trait of dung beetles are head horns—novel, highly diversified secondary sexual weapons used in reproductive competition [17]. Horns vary tremendously in shape, size, and number across and within species, mediate widespread sexual dimorphisms, and exhibit a high degree of nutrition-responsive development among conspecific males [18]

. Furthermore, due to their diversity, abundance, pronounced environment-sensitive development, and unique feeding and reproductive traits, dung beetles have thus long served as important models for behavioral ( e. g. status dependent selection and sperm competition models [9, 10] ), developmental ( e. g. mechanisms of plasticity [11, 12] ), evolutionary ( e. g. the origins of evolutionary novelties [13] ), and ecological studies ( e. g

. gazella thought to reflect ancestral character states ( Fig 1B ). Specifically, we apply genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays to investigate the cis-regulatory basis for sex- and nutrition-biased horn formation in O. taurus and provide some of the first evolutionary insights into the chromatin architecture underlying nutrition-dependent morph determination and developmental plasticity broadly

. While gene family size changes and non-synonymous mutations are not necessarily indicative of adaptation, these analyses provide predictions of candidate genes and pathways for further assessment. We highlight evolutionary changes at five phylogenetic positions ( Fig 2A ) : each beetle species tip, the ancestral node of O. taurus and O. sagittarius, and the ancestral node of all three dung beetle species examined here ( Ot-Os-Dg node )

. taurus [27] and the broadly described importance of this pathway in insect development and metamorphosis [28]. We also identified orthogroup expansions of genes involved in lipid ( lipase 3; phospholipase A1-like ) and carbohydrate ( facilitated trehalose transporters ) metabolism, which may be associated with diversification of nutrition-responsive development in dung beetles

. One explanation for this opposing relationship between nutrition- and sex-responsive OCRs may be attributable to the evolutionary history of the molecular mechanisms underlying these two sets of phenotypes. Sexually dimorphic horn development is common not just in the Onthophagini but the family Scarabaeidae and thus likely originated early in scarab evolution

. Intriguingly, head horns lack homology to any other appendage or body part [20], and as such qualify as an evolutionary novelty even by the strictest of definitions [21], yet gains, losses, and modifications to horn structure are common among even closely related species [22]. Thus, beetle horns exhibit a high degree of evolutionary lability and represent a powerful natural system for understanding how complex traits originate and diversify [12, 13, 20, 22]

. Lastly, we estimated evidence of gene-wide episodic diversifying ( positive ) selection in the coding sequence of 2, 948 single copy orthogroups at the same five phylogenetic positions as above ( Fig 2A ) to identify changes in protein sequence possibly associated with dung beetle-specific adaptations

. taurus head horn development. Here, we are defining recently evolved ( putative ) regulatory elements as genomic regions ( identified as larger OCRs from the ATAC-seq data ) found in O. taurus but not detected in any other of the nine beetle genomes surveyed, which total 15, 850 ( 23. 3% ) of all OCRs identified in this tissue type ( Fig 4C ) ( see Methods and Materials for details on how orthologous regions were identified ). By comparison, only 3

. Chromatin configuration assays suggest alternative forms of intraspecific horn variation ( sexual dimorphism vs. nutritional plasticity ) are instructed by discrete regulatory architectures, a conclusion corroborated by two independent data sets ( ATAC-seq and H3K4K27me3 ChIP-seq ) ( Fig 5A, 5B ). These results demonstrate the importance of chromatin state in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits and highlight the role of gene regulatory networks in transducing environmental and genetic signals

In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the genomic basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles and highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of traits. Our results demonstrate that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals and provide new-quality reference genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this group. We also identify candidate genes and pathways associated with nutrition-responsive development in dung beetles, including those involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation, which are motivating new hypotheses for how nutrition-responsive development may have evolved in this group of insects.
Researchers used a cynomolg monkey model to investigate the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV), and the mechanisms associated with survival or death. They found that lymphoid organs are an early reservoir for LASV replication, with the virus entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varies with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa, but systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types leading to inflammation and fatal outcome. The study provides new insight into viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease. 

The researchers developed a cynolg monkey model reproducing different outcomes of Lassa fever in humans, infecting animals with Josiah and AV strains of LAS at same dose and route leading to fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. They analyzed dynamics and tropism of these strains to shed light on pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. Lymphoid organs are early reservoir for LAS replication in all animals, with cell tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differing between outcomes. 

The replication in SLO is followed by systemic dissemination to all organs in severe fever, whereas restricted to few in surviving animals. LAS strains belonging to lineage 5 cause less disease than Josiah in cynolg monkeys. The aim was to characterize pathogenesis and immune responses with survival or death in cynolg model where AV leads to non-lethal and Jos results in death. Early replication occurs in skin adjacent to subcutaneous site, and events in SLO may determine later responses and outcome. IFα and γ, E, IL/J/STAT, G/M, IL/STAT, and complement pathways activated during fever, more intense after Josiah infection. 

Lassa is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa, with lethality 15-30%. LAS displays no spread in surviving, but systemic replication in fatal, leading cytokine storm and organ failure resembling septic syndrome. The discrepancy with natural infection does not alter course, lungs targeted with virus and pathological tropism reported in LAS-infected cynolg using aerosol.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ), such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ), nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ). However, the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause, or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear, and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. First, taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block. Second, we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations. Third, we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration. Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function.

    Nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) defects underlie several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) [1–3]

. We have demonstrated that there is a direct impact of Importin-β nuclear import dysregulation on multiple phenotypes seen in neurodegeneration through the following: ( 1 ) NEMF-specific dysregulation of Importin-β nuclear import ( but not of Transportin-1 import ), ( 2 ) mis-localization and aggregation of NEMF, TDP43, Ran, RanGAP1 and Importin-β, ( 3 ) amyloid-like aggregation, ( 4 ) PLA cytoplasmic association between NEMF R86S and Importin-β, ( 5 ) cytoplasmic accumulation of NEMF,

. In this study, we have demonstrated that the mutant mouse model, NemfR86S, exhibits impaired nuclear import of proteins containing canonical nuclear localization signals ( cNLS ), consequently leading to defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport both in vitro and in vivo. We have identified a specific defect in Importin-β mediated transport that manifests as both nuclear loss and cytoplasmic gain of NEMF, Importin-β, and TDP-43, along with a collapse of the Ran gradient

A common pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of cytoplasmic amyloid-like aggregated proteins [17, 65, 66]. Our data, utilizing two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in Nemf ( R86S and R487G ), demonstrate that disrupted Importin-β nuclear import results in the mis-localization of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm. Importantly, this disruption of NCT is specific to Importin-β nuclear import and not to Transportin-1 or RQC function

. Our study reveals that there is a causative role for an Importin-β nuclear import deficiency upstream of the multiple proteinopathies and transcriptional pathologies found in neurodegenerative disease.

. Here we show that mutations in Nuclear Export Mediator Factor ( NEMF ) in mice result in Importin-β-specific nuclear import defects, cytoplasmic protein mis-localization, and recapitulate phenotypic and transcriptional alterations found in neurodegenerative disorders. We further show that transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases

. Pathological disruption of NCT, such as the mis-localization of Nuclear Pore Complex proteins ( Nups ), NTRs, and Ran-GTPase, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of ALS, FTD, and AD/ADRD [9–16]. In addition, pathological cytoplasmic protein aggregates mark the progression of most neurodegenerative diseases [17, 18]

. These dysfunctions are not, however, recapitulated upon knockdown of NEMF’s RQC partner LTN1, indicating a specific, non-RQC role for NEMF in impairing Importin-β nuclear import. Collectively, our data suggests that Importin-β nuclear import dysfunction serves as a primary upstream pathomechanism for TDP-43-mislocalization and phosphorylation, as well as transcriptional dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NEMF mutations result in nuclear import defects and cause cytoplasmic protein aggregates, leading to the sequestration of nuclear transport factors and TDP-43 pathology. The nuclear loss of TDP-43 prompted us to examine transcriptional profiles in this mutant model to determine whether there were similar transcriptional changes as those seen in neurodegeneration with TDP-43 dysfunction

. Additionally, cytoplasmic mis-localization was also observed for Importin-β and TDP-43 ( Fig 1A, 1C and 1D ). Interestingly, the loss of nuclear localization of NEMF and TDP-43 was exclusive to neurons in the ventral horn, consistent with lamina IX [44] ( S1 Fig ). To investigate an expanded temporal scale of the disease progression, we turned to the late onset NemfR487G mouse that also displays a later-onset progressive neuromuscular disease with a milder disease phenotype [21]

. Altogether, this suggests that Importin-β’s function as both a nuclear import receptor and cytoplasmic chaperone is disturbed in this NemfR86S model, wherein the protein is sequestered away from its typical function, and that we can recapitulate many of these in vivo alterations through transient Importin-β pharmacological impairment

. This cytoplasmic accumulation was also observed when WT MEFs were treated with an Importin-β antagonist IPZ [46], highlighting the role of Importin-β as both a nuclear import mediator and a cytoplasmic chaperone ( Fig 3E and 3F ). Importin-β has been shown to form cytoplasmic granules under basal conditions as well as under stress [47]. It has been demonstrated that under conditions of stress such as neurodegenerative disease, both the abundance and size of these granules increases [47]

. This ability to inhibit and reverse both physiological and deleterious phase transitions has been implicated in multiple forms of neurodegenerative diseases, wherein RNA-binding proteins or Prion-like domains are lost from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm [69–77]. This is demonstrated in the role of Importin-β cooperating with Importin-α to prevent and reverse TDP-43 condensation and fibrillization [69, 71]

. During nuclear import, nuclear import receptors ( NIRs ), such as Importin-β, directly bind their cargo in the cytoplasm or utilize importin-α as an adaptor to bind cargo proteins bearing a classical nuclear localization signal ( cNLS ) [6, 7]. Other NIRs, such as Transportin-1, recognize different nuclear localization signals, such as a Proline-Tyrosine NLS ( PY-NLS ), for transport into the nucleus [8]

. Altogether, our results show that targeting nuclear import pathways can recapitulate Stmn2 downregulation in both mice and human cell lines, whereas Apoe dysregulation is non-neuronal specific and may be more specific to NEMF impairment than Importin-β.

. Nevertheless, our observations of pathological TDP-43 insoluble aggregates, TDP-43 missplicing events, and a downregulation of Stmn2 mRNA and protein after a nuclear import block indicates a direct causal role of defective nuclear import upstream of these pathologies. Additional dysregulation of transcripts, such as the upregulation of Meg3 and Apoe, as well as the downregulation of Fig 4, are seen in our model and mirror changes seen in neurodegenerative disease [51, 89]

. The loss of Stmn2 transcript in neurodegenerative disease has been associated with T-43 pathology [90, 91], while the upregulation of Meg3 has been linked to neurodegener disease [92, 93]. Our findings suggest that Import-β nuclear dysfunction may be a common upstream cause of these dysregulation in neurode disease

Our results demonstrate that transient inhibition of Import-β in both mouse and human neuronal nonuronal cells recapitulates proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative disease, suggesting a causal role for Import-β in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegener diseases.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications. Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial. CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagenesis efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Furthermore, by temporally removing DNA modifications, we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants.

   . In this study, we apply a eukaryotic ten-eleven translocation ( TET ) methylcytosine dioxygenase [24] to temporally reduce the abundance of 5ghmdC within the phage T4 genome to enable the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas. This results in the facilitated introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner, exemplarily shown for two specific T4 phage ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection

. This observation demonstrates that DNA modifications protect the genome of phage T4 from nucleolytic cleavage by Cas12, enabling efficient phage lysis. Next, we analyzed the lysis by NgTET-treated T4 in the same experimental settings. While infecting E. coli expressing CRISPR-Cas12_Alt, a delay of approximately 250 min in lysis compared to infection with T4 WT was observed

. Our study circumvents previous limitations and presents a novel approach for precise, site-specific phage mutagenesis based on temporarily reducing phage DNA modifications. This enhances DNA accessibility for Cas nucleases, boosting the efficiency of phage DNA double-strand breaks–the first and essential step of CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis

. The scarless nature of this approach allows for the precise study of the impact of introduced mutations on phage infection without the side effects associated with gene deletion or reporter gene insertion. Overall, our findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into genomes of lytic phages that possess cytosine-based DNA modifications

. To assess the impact of NgTET treatment of phages on Cas-mediated genome engineering efficiency, we selected two T4 phage-encoded genes, modA, and alt, as mutation targets. Alt and ModA belong to the enzyme class of ADP-ribosyltransferases. During infection, they have been described to play a crucial role in the takeover of control over E. coli cells by T4 phage, although the exact mechanisms behind this process are still not fully understood [45–47]

. Furthermore, the phages released during the lysis with NgTET-treated T4 were confirmed to be infectious, as evidenced by their ability to infect and lyse wild-type E. coli ( S1 Fig ). The previous experiment showed that treating phage T4 with NgTET led to delayed lysis of E. coli, showing the importance of phage DNA modifications for its fitness. Building on this, we aimed to investigate whether CRISPR-Cas targeting of the phage DNA would also be enhanced due to the NgTET treatment

. However, the application of the CRISPR-Cas-based phage mutagenesis on the model phages, such as phage T4, has revealed an overall low mutagenesis efficiency ( 0–3% ) and being strongly dependent on the spacer selected for the mutagenesis [15–17]. This strongly impedes the specific targeting of the phage genome via CRISPR-Cas and requires pre-screening for efficient spacer before the mutagenesis, strongly reducing the applicability of the approach for efficient phage mutagenesis

. The low Cas targeting efficiency of phage DNA is further reflected in the low mutagenesis rate, necessitating the screening of a large phage population to identify the phage mutants. Recently, the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13a system has been reported to enable the introduction of multi-gene deletions and single codon changes. However, a minimum of three point mutations must be inserted for this system to counterselect for T4 phage mutants [52]

. To introduce the site-specific point mutations into the phage DNA, we designed the spacers to precisely target the intended mutation insertion sites within alt and modA. We conducted targeting efficiency ( TE ) tests to evaluate Cas nucleases’ efficiency in targeting phage DNA. Therefore, we infected an E. coli strain that heterologously expressed one of the analyzed CRISPR-Cas systems with a spacer designed to target the alt or modA gene with a specific number of T4 phages

. To explore the biological functions of phage-derived proteins, gene deletion has been the primary method historically employed, providing critical insights into gene essentiality for the phage infection process [6, 7]. However, mutagenesis targeting only the catalytic residues rather than deleting the entire protein offers a possibility to elucidate the enzyme’s role within a specific molecular context

. Leveraging the demethylation activity of TET enzymes on phage DNA presents an opportunity to diminish 5hmdC levels and compete effectively with T4 phage α/β-gt enzymes for the substrate 5hmdC during T4 phage infection. This approach has the potential to decrease the prevalence of 5ghmdC in phage DNA, thereby enhancing the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing tools, as depicted in Fig 1C

. To generate T4 phages carrying Alt E577A and ModA E165A mutations, we employed the heterologously expressed CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12 systems, which were previously evaluated for the application to engineer phage T4 [15, 44]. For both CRISPR-Cas systems, the targeting of WT T4 DNA was reported to be strongly hindered by phage DNA modifications, leading to overall low mutagenesis efficiency [15, 44]

. Therefore, targeted mutagenesis of lytic phages is highly challenging, as evidenced by the diverse strategies developed in recent years to approach it ( reviewed in Mahler et al. 2023 [8] ). Many developed approaches rely on recombination between phage DNA and a donor sequence, e. g., homologous recombination. This approach allows for gene replacements, deletions, or insertions. However, the efficiency of this method is low ( >0

. The propagation of the resulting phage progeny in the strain without NgTET, allows the glycosyltransferases to introduce the glycosylations back and thereby recover the wild-type-like modifications of phage T4 DNA. Such a recovery of DNA modifications in the subsequent phage generation highlights the major advantage of NgTET-coupled CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis over performing it with α/β-gt deletion or amber strains

. An important feature of the NgTET/CRISPR-Cas-coupled DNA gene-editingtool—presented in this study—is its potential transferability to other bacteriophages. Our homology search results show the cytosine-modifying enzymes being distributed among various phages ( Fig 5 ). Particularly, homologs of gene 42, responsible for the conversion of dC to 5hmdC, were detected in numerous phages

. The successful application of targeted CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis across various organisms [14], has also raised the interest in its application for phage engineering. In this context, CRISPR-Cas can be employed to target a specific position within the phage genome during infection, generating a DNA double-strand break. This break can be further repaired via homologous recombination with donor DNA ( DNA carrying the desired mutation ) present within the infected cell

. We hypothesized that the reduction in DNA modifications could increase the susceptibility of phage DNA to Cas nuclease targeting, as demonstrated by the more effective targeting of non-glycosylated phage T4 DNA by CRISPR-Cas12 [44]. Therefore, NgTET treatment of T4 DNA would potentially result in Cas-mediated DNA double-strand breaks. Such a break would impede phage replication, consequently causing delayed or even absent lysis by NgTET-treated T4 compared to T4 WT

. The increased targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases allows for sequence-specific spacer selection. Simultaneously, the improved targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases can be exploited for efficient counterselection, streamlining the enrichment process for the generated phage mutant

. These advantages collectively position this technique as a valuable tool in synthetic biology and biotechnology for creating "designer phages" as well as in fundamental research to explore the mechanisms underlying phage infections. Moreover, this technique offers the opportunity to study the influence of phage epigenetic modifications on phage fitness and infection, as exemplified by the delayed lysis of NgT-treated T4 compared to T WT.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. A manifold of mechanisms act in concert to ensure adequate DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide, act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and thus represent a major threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ), a yet incompletely understood NER sub-pathway. Here, using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified histone variant H2A. Z as an important component to safeguard transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A. Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, H2A. Z is needed for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Our finding that histone variant H2A. Z is required for efficient TC-NER and contributes to the prevention of UV-induced DSBs highlights the significance of DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability.

. Z histone variant, as a gene required for efficient TC-NER and RNAPII clearance following UV irradiation. Importantly, UV-irradiation of H2A. Z-depleted cells leads to an accumulation of double-strand breaks ( DSBs ), which constitute a major threat to genome stability.

Using an unbiased classical genetic screening approach, we have identified histone variant H2A. Z as a new player in TC-NER. Our results support a role for this histone variant both in the regulation of RNAPII occupancy and TC-NER repair efficiency upon UV irradiation. Importantly, defective response to UV damage leads to sustained DSBs and genome instability in htz1Δ cells. H2A

. H2A. Z is the only histone variant that is conserved from yeast to human and, while it is essential for proper mammalian development, it is not essential in budding yeast except in conditions requiring rapid transcriptional activation [27]. Previous studies have linked H2A. Z to the DNA damage checkpoint [28, 29], DSB repair [26, 30, 31], chromosome segregation [32], DSB-free resolution of stalled replication forks [20] and GG-NER in H2A

. Z versus H2B increased at the RPB2 locus, in agreement with a role for this histone variant in the response to UV damage at transcribed genes. Since H2A. Z deposition is strictly dependent on the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex in yeast [25], and that the absence of H2A. Z leads to faulty activity of this complex [26], we analyzed the impact of SWR1 deletion on 4-NQO and UV sensitivity in rad7Δ and htz1Δ strains ( S3 Fig )

. We thus propose a model in which H2A. Z incorporation in the vicinity of RNAPII stalled at DNA lesions promotes efficient TC-NER repair by establishing a repair-favorable chromatin environment and, thus, preventing the accumulation of chromatin-bound RNAPII that could cause conflicts with the replication machinery in UV challenged cells ( S4 Fig )

. Our findings that this histone variant is required for efficient TC-NER led us to ask whether UV irradiation may magnify genome instability in htz1Δ cells. Therefore, we used a plasmid-borne reporter system based on two truncated leu2 inverted repeats to measure recombination frequency in control and UV-irradiated cells ( Fig 3A ). Cells lacking H2A. Z showed a moderate increase in recombination as compared to the wild-type, which was exacerbated upon UV irradiation ( from 3-fold to 4

. The HTZ1 gene encodes the yeast histone variant H2A. Z ( also called Htz1 ), which has been implicated in numerous processes including DSB repair by homologous recombination ( HR ), replicative stress induced DSB formation and GG-NER in H2A. Z-bearing nucleosomes of an inactive promoter [16–20], but so far not in TC-NER. Because of the ubiquitous role of H2A

. With the aim at identifying new TC-NER factors to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this repair pathway, we screened the non-essential deletion strain collection from S. cerevisiae for mutations leading to increased sensitivity to 4-NQO. This genetic screen was performed in strains lacking the RAD7 GG-NER gene as a way to enhance the sensitivity of the assay and enrich in new functions involved in TC-NER. We identified HTZ1, which encodes the yeast H2A

. Z-bearing nucleosomes at a repressed promoter [18]. While the participation of H2A. Z in DSB repair seems to be conserved in higher eukaryotes [33], the mechanisms underlying the function of this histone variant in the maintenance of genome stability remain largely unresolved. The H2A. Z histone variant had not been linked to TC-NER so far, and to our knowledge only one report relates H2A. Z-containing nucleosomes located at an inactive promoter with increased GG-NER efficiency [18]

. Worthy of note, other TC-NER factors were shown to function both in promoting efficient repair on transcribed genes and in avoiding harmful collisions between the replication and transcription machineries. For example, ELOF1 ( Elf1 in yeast ) not only promotes TC-NER but also protects cells against transcription-mediated replication stress upon DNA damage [12, 13]

. Hence, bulky DNA lesions exhibit strong mutagenic and thus tumorigenic potential, as exemplified by skin cancer, which is primarily caused by exposure to natural UV light [4]. Transcription-blocking lesions are mainly repaired by transcription-coupled NER ( TC-NER ), which differs from global genome NER ( GG-NER ) in the lesion recognition step, while the core repair reaction is common to both sub-pathways

. In TC-NER, stalling of the elongating RNAP at the DNA damage promptly triggers the repair reaction on the transcribed strand ( TS ) of active genes while in GG-NER, a specialized DNA damage recognition complex–which consists of Rad7, Rad16 and Elc1 in budding yeast–improves the detection of the helix-distorting DNA lesions throughout the genome

. Our ChIP analysis indicates that RNAPIIs remain bound at the 5’-UTR region but not in the RPB2 gene body in UV irradiated htz1Δ cells. This data can reflect either that RNAPIIs accumulate at the 5’-UTR due to defective TC-NER and recovery of transcription elongation, or that UV-dependent degradation of promoter-bound RNAPIIs–a critical pathway to avoid DNA-damage induced transcription stress [38]–does not take place correctly in the absence of histone variant H2A. Z

. Z nucleosomes [22–24], revealed a weak repair delay on the NTS and a strong repair defect on the TS in htz1Δ cells. These defects likely arise because of a lack of H2A. Z incorporation by the SWR1 complex in response to UV damage, as Htz1 relative enrichment increases upon UV irradiation throughout RPB2 and that swr1Δ, htz1Δ and swr1Δ htz1Δ cells are equally sensitive to UV in a GG-NER deficient background

. Our results demonstrate that TS repair is severely impaired in the absence of the H2A. Z histone variant, while NTS repair appears only slightly affected, indicating that H2A. Z is required for TC-NER and facilitates GG-NER at transcribed genes. Analysis of RPB2 mRNA levels indicated that this gene is a little more expressed in htz1Δ than in wild-type cells ( S3 Fig ), excluding that transcriptional defects might account for the observed repair deficiencies

. Z. The latter would imply a direct role for this histone variant in the recruitment of the factors involved in UV-induced RNAPII degradation. Even though further investigation would be required to discriminate between these possibilities, the persistence of chromatin-bound RNAPIIs is predicted to lead to increased TRCs which may challenge genome stability

. Previous genome-wide studies of Htz1 occupancy showed that the constitutively expressed RPB2 gene is not enriched in H2A. Z-bearing nucleosomes [22–24]. Therefore, we used a strain that expresses a Myc-tagged version of H2A. Z and a HA-tagged version of H2B to assess by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) whether H2A. Z deposition occurred in response to UV-induced damage ( S3 Fig ). During recovery from UV irradiation, the amount of H2A

. Because of the ubiquitous role of H2A. Z in DNA-templated processes, we generated double mutants lacking the HR factor Rad52, the post-replicative repair factor Rad18, or the endonuclease Rad1, which is strictly required for both NER sub-pathways, TC-NER and GGER, to test whether H2 Z is required in both pathways ( S Fig 4 ). The sensitivity to 4-NO of rad52, rad18, and rad1 ht1 strains was similar to that of the wild-type, indicating that H2 Z is not required for GG-N. However, the sensitivity of rad52 ht1 and rad18 ht1 strains to 4-N was similar to that of ht1, indicating that H Z is required for TC-N

Our findings that histone H2. Z is required for TCER and plays a role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation highlight the significance of a repair-optimized chromatin environment in genomic stability. The role of this histone variant in the regulation of RNAPI occupancy and TCER efficiency upon UV irradiation is consistent with a model in which H2. incorporation in the vicinity of RNAPI stalled at DNA promotes TCER by establishing a repair-favorable chromatin environment and preventing accumulation of chrom-bound RNAPI that could conflict with replication machinery in UV-challenged cells ( S Fig 4 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known. This gene expression variation is context dependent, with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors, and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect. So far, little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence. To address this question, we analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived, European range and one from the ancestral, African range. In both the transcriptome and microbiome data, we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects, including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele specific expression revealed that, while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture, this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution.

    Using transcriptome data from parental and F1 hybrid D. melanogaster strains from an ancestral and a derived population in the midgut, hindgut and Malpighian tubule, we found that both the genetic basis of expression variation ( i. e. cis versus trans ) and the mode of expression inheritance ( i. e. dominant versus additive ) were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific ( Figs 3 and 4, Table 1 )

. To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on regulatory architecture in multiple functionally related, interconnected tissues, we analyzed messenger RNA-sequencing ( mRNA-seq ) data of midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule tissues in four D. melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids

. Thus, our results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds. Indeed, overall gene expression was most similar between the Malpighian tubule and the midgut ( Fig 1 ), despite these tissues being part of the excretory and digestive system, respectively, while the two gut tissues are part of the same alimentary canal

. Overall, our findings yield insight into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, the effects of genetic background on expression and microbiome variation, as well as the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies.

. One way to interrogate the relative contribution of these types of regulatory variants to gene expression variation in species such as Drosophila, where inbred, relatively isogenic strains are available, is to compare gene expression of two parental strains or species as well as expression of their alleles in F1 hybrids [15]

. e. between species [16–18], trans-regulatory variation tends to be more common among individuals within a species [5–6, 19]. However, deviations from this pattern of regulatory variation have been documented in Drosophila [20–23] as well as other species [24–25], which underscores that there remains much to learn about the evolution of gene expression regulation, especially over short evolutionary distances

. Thus overall, tissue type ( i. e. gut region ) had the largest impact on microbial community composition and diversity, with genetic background also affecting microbiome variation to a lesser degree, especially within the hindgut; however, these genetic background effects do not appear to be related to host gene expression variation.

. In contrast, gene expression in the hindgut was less differentiated among genetic backgrounds but more differentiated from the other tissues while the midgut showed the opposite pattern ( Figs 1 and S1C ), suggesting that the expression and regulatory variation we detected in these tissues is unlikely to be driven by bacterial community composition. Thus overall, tissue type ( i. e

. Interestingly, overall gene expression divergence within the same genotype between the midgut and Malpighian tubule was significantly lower than gene expression divergence between either of these two tissues and the hindgut ( t-test; Bonferroni-corrected P < 5 x 10−5 for both; S1C Fig ), suggesting that among these three tissues, expression within the same genetic background is most similar between the Malpighian tubule and the midgut

. To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on digestive tract microbiome composition, we further performed microbiome sequencing on the same gut samples for which we performed mRNA-seq. In both the mRNA-seq and microbiome data, we found extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects

. Thus, our results suggest that the level of functional and physical interconnectivity between tissues may not necessarily be predictive of similarity in gene expression or regulatory architecture. Consistent with this interpretation, we detected similar fold-size differences in the proportion of cis-regulated genes in the hindgut versus the Malpighian tubule or midgut ( Fig 4A ) as has previously been reported in the testes versus the head or ovaries [28]

. However, we should note that the tissues we examined in this study, and the midgut in particular, are known to be regionalized [37–38, 40] with an estimated 22, 4, and 5 distinct cell types currently described in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules, respectively [49–50]; therefore, it is possible that we may have missed some of the more subtle differences in gene regulation that occur among individual regions or cell types

. A previous study in D. melanogaster larvae found that overall developmental ( i. e. temporal ) gene expression specificity increased during adaptation in a derived population [36]. In contrast, in our dataset the ancestral ZI418 genetic background showed the highest tissue ( i. e

. Bacterial community composition was highly divergent between the two gut tissues, and the effect of genetic background appeared to be driven by higher diversity in the hindgut, which also showed more differentiation among strains ( Figs 6, 7 and S11 ). Because all flies were reared in the same lab environment, a large portion of the detected bacterial community was likely acquired in the lab

. Previous studies using F1 hybrids in Drosophila have found that genetic background [19, 21, 28] and body part or tissue [21–22, 28] can have large effects on regulatory architecture; however, to our knowledge, this is the first study examining highly spatially and functionally proximate tissues that not only communicate with each other but also functionally and physically interact

. melanogaster populations have had to adapt to new habitats, and previous studies have found evidence that at least some of the expression divergence detected between derived and ancestral African populations is adaptive [32–36]. The midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules, which are analogous to the mammalian small and large intestines and kidneys, respectively, physically connect to and interact with one another at the midgut-hindgut junction and are part of the D

. We detected significant differences in gut bacterial communities between the midgut and hindgut ( Figs 6 and 7, S11 Table; PERMANOVA, P = 0. 001 ), which is unsurprising given that these gut regions differ in their pH and associated digestive functions [37]. We also detected a significant effect of the genetic background ( i. e

. Indeed, when we examined community composition within each tissue individually, the genetic background significantly influenced the gut bacterial community in the hindgut while it had no significant effect on the structure of the community in the midgut ( Fig 7, S11 Table; PERMANOVA, P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 89 respectively ). We also detected significant tissue and genetic background effects on bacterial alpha-diversity ( S11 Fig, S12 and S13 Tables; LMM, P = 0. 017 and P < 0

. The midgut had a higher proportion of ambiguous genes and a smaller proportion of conserved genes than the other examined tissues ( Fig 4A ). We detected the most cis-only genes in the hindgut, with 2. 3–4. 2 fold more genes categorized as cis-only in comparison to the other examined tissues ( Fig 4A ). In comparison to other genetic backgrounds, the SU58xZI197 background had a higher proportion of ambiguous genes and a smaller proportion of conserved genes as well as 2. 2–4. 7- and 2

. e. strain ) as well as a significant interaction effect between the examined strain and gut region on the bacterial community ( Fig 7, S11 Table; PERMANOVA, P ≤ 0. 015 for both ), indicating that the effect of genetic background on the microbiome is not uniform across the gut. We also detected a significant effect of genetic on alpha-diversity in the hindut but not the midut ( S Fig 12, S13; LMM, P = 0 0 017 and P 0 0 89 respectively ), suggesting that genetic background may have a larger impact on diversity in the hindut than the midut

Our results suggest that the level of functional and physical interconnectivity between tissues may not be predictive of similarity in gene or regulatory architecture. Consistent with this, we detected fold-size differences in the proportion of cis-regulated in the hindut versus the Malighian tub or midut ( Fig 4 ) as previously reported in test versus the head or ovaries [28]. However, we note the tissues examined in this study and the midut in particular are regionalized [37–40] with estimated 22, 4 and 5 cell types described in the midut hindut and Maligh tub respectively [49–50] therefore it is possible we may have missed some subtle differences in regulation occur among regions or cell types.

    Title: 
    Abstract: While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown, information on early cases can be used to date it. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g., first human SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data. Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case. Here, we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case. We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data. We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK, dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21, 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23–September 5, 2020 ). Next, we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020. We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28, 2019 ( 95% IPR: November 2–December 9, 2019 ). Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19.

   . The comparison of simulation outputs and available case data then allow the estimation of the date of emergence of the outbreak, as well as other key epidemiological pieces of information such as the proportion of the epidemic that remains undetected. We apply the framework to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in 2020 in the UK, and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019.

. Fig G in S1 Text ). We parameterized our model using estimates from the literature; they are listed in Table 2. The 5 000 selected simulations represent ∼14% of all runs ( cf. Table A in S1 Text ) and are depicted in Fig H in S1 Text. Our simulations yield an estimated median number of days between the 1st SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded of 52 ( 95%IPR: 41–78 ) days, dating the emergence ( i. e

. Various attempts have been made to date the first human infections by SARS-CoV-2 that led to the COVID-19 pandemic ( noting that earlier spillovers, leading to dead-ends, may have occurred ), using case data and/or viral genomic data. Using a stochastic model for the epidemic spread coupled with genomic data allowing to trace transmission at the individual level, Pekar et al. [1] estimated that the first human infection took place between late October and early December 2019

. Quantifying the time that emerging epidemics remain undetected before detecting the first cases is particularly important in the context of emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, where very early cases may remain unidentified, especially if a high proportion of the infections are asymptomatic [27] ( N. B. : most COVID-19 cases with symptoms onset up to December 31, 2019 were declared retrospectively [28] )

. To the best of our knowledge, the novelty of our findings rests on using exclusively a population-dynamics approach, unlike previous studies aiming to date the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic. The median estimate in Pekar et al. [1] ( which is a first infection, and not a tMRCA ) falls ∼8 days before ours, which can be explained by the fact that our approach ignores genomic information

. This result makes sense: the tMRCA does not necessarily yield the date of first infection, which may have occurred before the most recent common ancestor. Next, we apply our model to data on the early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, estimating the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection around November 28 ( 95%IPR: Nov 2–Dec 9 ), 2019, and not earlier than September 26, 2019. These ranges also fall remarkably close to—slightly later than—previously published estimates [1]

. In conclusion, our study contributes to the literature with estimates of the date of first infection of early COVID-19 cases and infections with the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant. Our results fall within ranges previously found by studies relying on genomic data, thus offering weight to these estimates using different methodologies.

We estimate the date of emergence of an epidemic outbreak, defined as the date of the first infection leading to a sustained transmission chain, relying on estimates of key epidemiological parameters as well as available data on the first N observed cases. With our population-dynamics approach, we recover estimates very close to those of previous studies [1, 12], which were obtained using information from whole genome sequences

. The main objective of our study is the estimation of the date of the first infection leading to a sustained epidemic ( hereafter referred to as the date of epidemic/outbreak emergence ), using available data on the first N detected and reported cases. To this end, we build a stochastic model and design a simulation framework extending our previous work that only used information on the first detected case [11]. Our rationale for extending the analysis to more cases is two-fold

. There is also evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced in other countries for some time before the first reported cases in these countries [6–8, 29]. Since the first known cases are likely not to be the first human infections, there is a need for methods estimating the time of the first infection. The value of such work is essentially historical, but also helps understand how long an epidemic may have gone undetected, and design early warning systems accordingly

. This may also be a limitation in the context of epidemics emerging from multiple spillover events, such as has been concluded by [1] relying on data on the early SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Fourth, the simulations of our model do not allow to consider time-dependent parameters, but a more classic Approximate Bayesian Computation approach will

. e., COVID-19 cases dataset ) as well as previously published estimates of the date of emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic [1] ( personal communication of the distributions ), for comparison. Our estimates of the date of first infection are consistent with those previously found in [1], but yield a lower bound closer to the date of first case detection ( cf. Table B in S1 Text )

. Our median estimates for the emergence date fall within a very close, slightly narrower range than that found by running an updated version of [11], while falling ∼ 1 week earlier than the estimated tMRCA [12]. These comparisons are summarized in Table B in S1 Text. We further estimated the epidemic size at the date of infection of the Nth case at about 90 800 ( 95%IPR: 80 500–102 000 ). The simulated detected cases thus represent a proportion of about 0. 48% ( 95%IPR: 0. 43%–0

. Other studies have focused on the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to different countries. Some have used molecular clock analyses relying on genomic data to determine the time of most recent common ancestor ( tMRCA; providing an upper bound for the time of the first infection, see Fig 1 ) of lineages introduced in a focal country. For instance, studies have been conducted using genomic data from France [6], the United States [7] and the United Kingdom ( UK ) [8]

. Genomic analyses on their own are usually insufficient to estimate the time of the first infections: the tMRCA does not necessarily approximate the emergence date [13], which can have taken place earlier ( see Fig 1 ). Infection times occurring earlier than the tMRCA may be estimated thanks to other mathematical models using population dynamics methodologies

. Table A in S1 Text provides other calibration metrics like the delay between the 1st and Nth sequenced samples in the simulations. Fig 2 depicts our estimates of the date of emergence along with the epidemic curve ( i. e., the daily number of sequenced samples; by sampling date ), for context, as well as previous estimates, for comparison. In particular, we ran an updated version of the model presented by Czuppon et al

We extend the methods presented in the numerical applications of [11], where the time of emergence was estimated from data on the first reported case only, using a stochastic population-dynamics approach. We model the early stages of the epidemic and use dates of the first N observed cases to estimate the date of emergence

. We then aggregate epidemiological indicators such as the per-day number of new infections and cases ( denoted by dk, where k = 1, 2, … ), since this is the time scale at which most data are presented. We run stochastic simulations forward in time, from t = t0, the time of occurrence of the first ( undetected ) infection ( i. e., I ( t0 ) = 1 ), until the end of the day of detection of the Nth case, dK, which is determined by dK ≤ t ≤ T, where T is the total number of days of the simulation, and dK is the day of the Nth detected case. The number of new cases at each day k is denoted by n ( k ), and the number of undetected cases by u ( k ). The number of undet cases at the end of day k is u ( k ) = u ( k − 1 ) + n ( k − u ( k − 1 ), where ( k = 1, 2, …, T. The number of detected cases at the end of day k is d ( k = d ( k − 1 ) + n ( k, where k = 1, 2, T. The total number of cases at the end of k is c ( k = d k + u k, k = 1, 2, T. The number of undet cases at the end of the simulation is u ( T = u ( T. The number of detected at the end of the simulation is d T = d T. The number of cases at the end of the simulation is c T = c T. The number of cases at the end of the simulation is c T = c. The number of undet at the end of the simulation is u T = u.

Researchers have developed an agent-based model to simulate the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in the presence of non-hologous chromosomes. The model captures the dynamics of the entire chromosome ensemble, including attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between nonolog chromosomes. Simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome, while attractive forces come into play when distances between homolog are small. Repulsive forces shorten the time in nonolog interactions, representing molecular processes that dissociate nonolog chromosomes. The model allows analysis of individual trajectories throughout meiotic prophase, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of chromosomal parameters, such as number, size, movement, and forces, provide insights into contributions to pairing.

The model suggests hom pairing is achieved by two mechanisms: homolog confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation interactions with nonolog chromosomes via repulsive force, and confinement enables hom to assess similarities as attractive. Simulations indicate disruptions due to collisions nonolog during incipient interactions hom pairs. Results suggest hom pairs are susceptible to dislodged by nonolog chromosomes. The model considers interactions, translation, and random motion within the nucleus. Comparison with experiment shows qualitative and quantitative convergence for homolog and nonolog kinetics.

Simulations indicate neither attractive nor repulsive alone achieve pairing, yet some differences. With repulsive, forces drive hom together via exclusion, slower kinetics smaller chromosomes. With attractive, hom drawn only when proximity, proceeds slowly, little size effect. The model treats pairing as endpoint, not segregation during meiosis, facilitating comparison arrested cells.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene. Interestingly, miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development, but miR-34a is more abundant. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ), we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription, and at 8, 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes. At 72 hpf, loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA, but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. 

    Supporting Text:
    We determined that in zebrafish, both miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes are primarily dependent on p53 for induction under DNA damage conditions and partially dependent on p53 for their baseline expression. Some residual induction of miR-34 genes could be due to other transcription factors activated by DNA damage

. The most direct evidence of miR-34a tumor-suppressive functions was provided by the earlier tumor onset in compound miR-34a and tp53 mutants compared to the corresponding single tp53 mutants. Transient overexpression of miR-34a induced a greater sensitivity in zebrafish embryos to camptothecin ( CPT ) treatment but not to γ-irradiation. CPT is a DNA damage-inducing topoisomerase I inhibitor [29], which activates p53 in zebrafish [30]

. Despite miR-34a loss not affecting p53 target genes, we evaluated how miR-34a affects tumor development in p53 mutant zebrafish given that epigenetic silencing of the MIR34A gene in humans carrying TP53 mutant alleles contributes to cancer progression [15]. We used tp53-/- and tp53R217H/R217H as control mutant lines and generated the homozygous maternal-zygotic miR-34a-/-; tp53-/- and miR-34a-/-; tp53R217H/R217H compound mutant lines

. We demonstrated that expression of miR-34 genes is partially dependent on p53 under control conditions, and their induction by DNA damage is fully p53-dependent. Moreover, we found that miR-34a has small but significant transcriptomic effects in 28 hour post-fertilization ( hpf ) zebrafish embryos under both control and DNA damage conditions

. In this study, we characterized zebrafish miR-34a and its functional interactions with tp53, as well as its independent effects by performing transcriptomic, mutant and overexpression studies. We generated and employed miR-34a mutant zebrafish to determine the effects of its loss on gene expression under normal conditions at three stages of development, which revealed a spectrum of transcriptomic effects

. A subsequent in vivo study demonstrated that in adult p53-null mice, miR-34a levels were reduced in some tissues but in major expression sites remained the same or higher [23]. Adult tissue analysis of miR-34 molecules in p53-null zebrafish may provide additional information on the dependence of miR-34 genes on p53. Overexpression of miR-34a has been one of the earliest tools to understand its function

. Taken together, our results show multiple nuanced but important roles for miR-34a in p53-mediated responses to DNA damage and tumour suppression as well as independent roles in metabolic regulation and blood development. This study opens new avenues for uncovering additional miR-34a and associated gene family functions in the zebrafish and for corroborating the conservation and in vivo relevance of these novel findings in other model systems.

. Thus, these studies show that there is likely context-dependence and more detailed in vivo animal model work is required to understand miR-34a-p53 interactions [19]. The zebrafish is highly suitable for studies of tp53, other tumor suppressors and cancer modeling [24]. However, little is known about the functions of miR-34 genes in this species apart from observations of miR-34a expression in specific brain regions [25]

. The induction of p21 and miR-34 genes by CPT treatment was significantly reduced in the tp53-/- fish, strongly indicating that miR-34 genes are p53 targets in the zebrafish. We also identified highly significant adjacent matches of the p53 transcription factor motif on both sides of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes when looking at the 20-kb regions around these genes ( Fig 2E and S2 Table )

. Although the extent of miR-34a overexpression was well above the physiological range ( 100 to 200-fold on average ), this experiment showed that miR-34a does not significantly influence p53 target genes in zebrafish. Consistent with this finding, it was previously reported that overexpression of all miR-34 RNAs in multiple cell lines either did not affect or upregulate p53 activity [22]

. We next examined inducibility of miR-34 genes by p53 by performing a time-course experiment on 24 hpf zebrafish embryos by treating them for 1, 2, 4 and 5 hours with 1μM CPT or 0. 1% DMSO as a control, and analyzed miR-34 and cycG1 and p21, p53 target gene transcripts

. Thus, if similar regulatory systems exist in zebrafish, the lack of miR-34a may decrease the level or activity of p53 making its level closer to the p53-null situation. In embryonic samples, we did not obtain evidence to support such regulation of wild-type tp53 by miR-34a, but we can’t exclude it at other stages and in missense p53 mutants

. The miR-34 gene family in most vertebrates consists of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes. The miR-34a gene is expressed nearly ubiquitously and in most tissues at a much higher level than miR-34b/c, which is expressed predominantly in the mammalian brain, lungs, testes and fallopian tubes [8]. MIR34A was the first microRNA gene identified as a p53 target, which is consistent with evidence that miR-34a overexpression stimulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [9–12]

. This increased tumor burden is not simply additive since we did not observe any tumors develop in miR-34a-/- adult zebrafish. One caveat to these results is that tp53-/- fish are in a different background strain ( CG1 [33] ) than the miR-34a-/- zebrafish ( casper [46] ), which does not allow for the elimination of background-dependent effects on tumor susceptibility

. Overall, miR-34a loss accelerates tumor development and may impact the tumor cell type spectrum and their anatomical location in compound mutants compared to the tp53-/- and tp53R217H/R217H mutants

. Indeed, our findings of more rapid tumor development upon miR-34a loss in tp53 mutants argue for its role in tumour suppression. These tumor-suppressive contributions should be investigated further to validate the findings and their potential translational application. Identifying expression changes after a microRNA expression perturbation helps define its functions

We first assessed the evolutionary conservation and expression of the miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes in zebrafish. All the miR-34s are very similar to each other and to their human homologs, with miR-34a being identical, and miR-34b and miR-34c having two and three differences from their human homologs, respectively, and all of them having nearly identical seed sequences ( positions 2–7 ) important for miRNA binding ( Fig 1A )

. However, such effects are unlikely a major influence since tp53R217H/ R217H and miR-34a-/- both originate from the casper strain. The more pronounced cancer incidence differences between tp53R217H/ R217H and miR-34a-/-; tp53R217H/ R217H fish could likely stem from the notion that miR-34a represses negative regulators of tp53 in addition to its tumor-suppressive functions

The miR-34 gene family is conserved in vertebrates, with mi-34 and mi-34/c in zraf and miR-34a mi-34/c in humans. The mi-34 gene is highly expressed in most tissues and mi-34/c in mammalian brain, lungs, testes, and fallopian tubes [8].

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites, xol-1 is expressed at very low levels. XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males, but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos. Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division, as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes, and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape. Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites.

   . elegans embryos [9, 10], we looked at the known pathways in males that are regulated by XOL-1 to better understand its potential roles in hermaphrodite embryonic development. In males, XOL-1 represses the activity of the SDC proteins [9, 10]. The SDC proteins independently regulate the pathways of sex determination and dosage compensation in hermaphrodites [17, 45, 46]

. The ratio of these elements differs between the two C. elegans sexes. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes resulting in an X: A ratio of 1, whereas the males only have one X chromosome resulting in an X:A ratio of 0. 5. XSEs and ASEs compete to repress and activate expression of the xol-1 gene in early embryos, respectively [15]. Due to the lower X:A ratio in males, transcription of XOL-1 is activated

. In this paper we confirm that xol-1 is transcribed in hermaphrodite early embryos at low levels, but contrary to previous assumptions we also show that the loss of xol-1 results in significant changes in the transcriptional profile of these early embryos. We also show that xol-1 mutant embryos show accelerated hermaphrodite embryonic development as well as precocious establishment of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways

. Within the context of multicellular organisms that have heterogametic sexes, sex determination is an important step that is established very early during embryogenesis. In the case of the nematode C. elegans, activation of the appropriate sex determinations pathway in the two sexes is based on the number of X chromosomes in the developing embryo [1, 2]. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes, whereas males only have a single X chromosome

. XOL-1 is the master switch that regulates both sex determination and dosage compensation in the C. elegans [9, 10]. XOL-1 acts as a sensor that can be toggled on or off depending on the ratio of signal elements from the X chromosome and the autosomes [9]. These elements on the X chromosome such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39 and fox-1 are known as X signal elements ( XSEs ) and those on the autosomes such as sea-1 and sea-2 are known as autosome signal elements ( ASEs ) [1, 11–16]

. These roles include regulating the speed of embryonic development during the early phases of embryogenesis, as well as the timing of initiation of sex-specific transcriptional programs. The disruption of xol-1 results in an acceleration of embryonic development and a measurable disruption of developmental pathways.

. Since XOL-1 is responsible for repressing the hermaphrodite sex determination pathway in XO animals, we hypothesized that the xol-1 mutant embryos would have upregulation of genes that are involved in hermaphrodite sex determination in XX early embryos as well. Conversely, since XOL-1 is responsible for activating the male sex determination pathways, we hypothesized that the loss of xol-1 would result in the downregulation of genes involved in embryonic male sex determination

. The xol-1 adult hermaphrodites also look, at least superficially, similar to healthy WT adults. Since xol-1 is important for turning on the male sex determination pathways, we hypothesized that it may be required in hermaphrodite embryonic development to potentiate the molecular pathways that lead to the development of the sperm producing structures in adult worms. To test this, we measured brood counts from xol-1 mutant embryos and WT. In C

. After this peak in expression, xol-1 transcripts continue to decline but are still detectable in the late stages of embryogenesis when embryos obtain their 3-fold morphology at about 550 mins after fertilization ( Fig 1C ). Genes that are known to disrupt embryonic developmental pathways generally tend to cause embryonic or larval lethality. In order to determine if disrupting xol-1 in hermaphrodites results in any phenotypes, we performed embryonic and larval viability assays

. This could be explained by the already very low transcription rate of male-specific genes in the WT early hermaphrodite embryos that the xol-1 dataset is normalized against. The fact that xol-1 L1 larvae do not continue to have a broadly disrupted transcriptional profile ( Fig 1B ) indicates that there are compensatory mechanisms that may be activated later in embryonic development

. In male embryos where xol-1 is highly expressed, male sex determination pathways are turned on and hermaphrodite sex determination and dosage compensation of the X chromosome are turned off [9, 10] ( Fig 3A )

. elegans embryogenesis, though some hormones are involved in regulating developmental timing at larval stages [68]. Furthermore, in xol-1 mutants we saw acceleration in two different ways. First, we observed that cell division was faster between the 8-cell and bean stages of embryonic development. Concurrently, we observed that these embryos had a more advanced late-embryonic transcriptional program which matched with their accelerated cell division

. To explore the differences in transcription between early male and hermaphrodite embryos, we generated male-enriched early embryo datasets using him-8 mutants. The him-8 gene is essential for the proper segregation of X chromosomes during meiosis [52, 53]. In WT C. elegans, males occur at a very low frequency ( ~0. 2% ) [54]

. Despite the significant difference in the timeline of cell division and broad disruption in the timeline of initiation of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways, the xol-1 embryos show no significant embryonic or larval lethality ( Fig 1D ). In addition, we see that most of the significant transcriptional differences in xol-1 vs WT in early embryos are resolved by the time the worms reach L1 larval stage ( Fig 1A, 1B )

. 001 ( Fig 4E ). This data demonstrates that XOL-1 is responsible for promoting the expression of male-biased genes, and for repressing hermaphrodite-biased genes in early hermaphrodite embryos. The disruption in hermaphrodite biased pathways appears to be more significant in terms of its effect size compared to the disruption in male biased pathways ( Fig 4C–4E )

. XOL-1 represses the activity of the SDC proteins [9, 10], that are known to regulate the hermaphrodite and male sex determination pathways [17, 45, 46]. Though the mechanism of this regulation has not yet been elucidated, it has been hypothesized that XOL-1 may transcriptionally regulate the sdc genes [56]. We looked at the expression of the sdc genes sdc-1, sdc-2 and sdc-3 in xol-1 mutant embryos to test this hypothesis

. elegans embryogenesis [42]. In this dataset, xol-1 was detectable at the 4-cell stage, which was the earliest available time-point ( Fig 1C ). xol-1 transcripts continued to accumulate in the embryos until 122min post fertilization ( Fig 1C ), which corresponds to early gastrulation

. Since xol-1 is a zygotically transcribed gene that needs to be transcriptionally repressed for the proper development of a hermaphrodite embryo, it has been assumed to be a male-specific gene. It was shown that in early hermaphrodite embryos, xol-1 is transcribed at very low levels compared to males. However, we show that loss of x- results in significant changes in the transcriptional profile of early heraphite embryos. We also show thatol- mutant embryos have accelerated embryonic development as well as precocious establishment of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways

In C. elegans, sex determination is based on the number of X chromosomes in the developing embryo [1, 2]. Hermrodites have two X chromosomes whereas males have a single X. X-1 is the master that regulates sex and dosage in C. elegans [9, 10 ] X- acts as a sensor that can be toggled on or off depending on the ratio of signal from the X and autos [9 ] elements on the X such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39 and fox-1 are known as X signal ( Xs ) and on autos such as sea- and sea-2 are known as autosome elements ( ASE ) [ 1,11–16] These regulate the speed of embryonic during early embryogenesis as well as the timing of initiation sex-specific programs. The disruption x- results in acceleration of embryonic development and measurable disruption of developmental pathways. Since X- is responsible for repressing heraphrod sex pathway in animals we hypothesized thatol mutant would have upregulation of genes involved in heraphrod sex in early embryos. Conversely, X is responsible for activating male determination we hypothesized that loss would result in downregulation genes in embryonic male determination. Theol adult heraphites look at least superficially similar to WT. Since is for on male pathways we hypothesized may be in hermrod embryonic to potentiate molecular that lead to development sperm structures adult. To test measured brood countsol mutant and WT. After peak expressionol continue decline but detectable late embry when obtain morphology about 550 after fertilization ( Fig 1 ) Gen that disrupt developmental generally cause embryonic or larval. To determine if disrupting in herm results any phen we performed embryonic lar viability. This could explained low rate male-specific in early heraph embryosol is normalized. thatol L do not have broadly transcriptional ( Fig 1 indicates compensatory may activated later development. In embryos where is highly expressed sex pathways on and heraphite determination compensation X are off [ 9 10 Fig 3 

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the role of X-1, a master regulator of sex determination and dosage compensation in C. elegans, in hermaphrod embryos. They found that X-1 is expressed at low levels in hermrod embryos, contrary to previous assumptions, and that loss of X- results in significant changes in transcriptional profile and accelerated embryonic development. They also showed that X- mutant embryos have precocious establishment of dosage and sex determination pathways. X- represses the activity of SDC proteins, which regulate hermrod and male determination, and is responsible for promoting male-specific genes and repressing hermrod-specific genes in herm embryos. The study demonstrates X- plays a role in developmental regulation in both sexes and MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of X- activity in herm.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness, and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.

   . In the second example, we use MGSurvE to distribute traps in order to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest for An. coluzzii populations on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. São Tomé, an island 225 km west of the coast of Gabon, has been identified as a suitable candidate for field trials of gene drive mosquitoes due to the presence of a single dominant malaria vector species ( An

. We describe how to set up, run and interpret output from MGSurvE, and provide examples of trap placement optimization for an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the tropical island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. We then conclude with a discussion of future modeling needs and applications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

. Lessons may be learned from studies of invasive species, a key result for which is that early detection is critical to minimizing invasion impact, preserving the possibility of local elimination, and maximizing the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs [14, 15]. To this end, we present MGSurvE: an analytical framework that optimizes trap placement for surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized

Here, we demonstrate the application of MGSurvE to distribute traps in order to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest for Ae. aegypti populations in the suburb of Yorkeys Knob 17 km northwest of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Yorkeys Knob was a trial site for a successful release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in 2011 [26] ( Fig 3B ). Ae. aegypti is a relatively local disperser, and so households serve as an appropriate population node for the landscape

. 5 ( Fig 4A ). We used discrete optimization due to the spatial scale, at which traps are most likely to be placed within localities. The placement of each trap was optimized according to a fitness function corresponding to minimizing the mean expected time for a given mosquito to be trapped, considering all possible origins on the landscape. The GA again implemented default mutation and crossover operators, with the code for this analysis being available in S2 Text and at https://github

. MGSurvE provides a number of functions to analyze and visualize results from the trap placement optimization procedure. Landscape and optimization reports are generated and exported to disk for performance checks and further analysis. Optimal trap placement can be plotted alongside the distribution of mosquito population nodes, with examples provided in the following use case section and Figs 2–4

Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever continue to pose a major public health burden throughout much of the world. Gene drive-modified mosquitoes have been proposed as a potentially transformative tool to complement currently-available tools by biasing inheritance in favor of an introduced allele [1]

. MGSurvE takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit—namely, resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., blood and sugar-based food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) and movement of mosquitoes between these resources on a landscape. It also accommodates traps with differing attractiveness profiles

. For spread beyond field sites, open questions relate to the optimal density and placement of traps and the frequency of sampling required to detect gene drive alleles, drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes while they can still be effectively managed. Similar questions relate to the spread of new alleles conferring resistance to other interventions, such as bednets or indoor residual spraying with insecticides

Before the distribution of traps can be optimized, a landscape must first be specified. In MGSurvE, the landscape is a metapopulation within which discrete mosquito population nodes are distributed. The appropriate scale at which populations are modeled depends on the species of interest and the resolution at which optimized trap placement is desired. For instance, a household scale may be adequate for Ae

. We considered both discrete and continuous optimization cases to compare their results, although using the discrete case is preferred due to the fact that traps would likely be assigned to households without a more precise location being specified. The placement of each trap was then optimized according to two fitness functions—minimizing the mean and maximum expected times for a given mosquito to be trapped, considering all possible origin sites on the landscape

. Progress has been made in Anopheles malaria vectors towards two general classes of gene drive strategies: i ) “population replacement”, whereby inheritance is biased in favor of an allele that confers refractoriness to pathogen transmission [2, 3]; and ii ) “population suppression”, whereby vector populations are suppressed by biasing inheritance in favor of an allele that induces a severe fitness cost or sex bias [4, 5]

. Surveillance for gene drive projects will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy at field sites, as has been done for previous self-limiting genetic control projects [9]; however, a more demanding task will be to detect unintended spread of gene drive alleles beyond field sites, and to detect the emergence of alternative alleles both within and beyond field sites

. The base MGSurvE implementation provides functions to implement exponential decay, long-tailed exponential and zero-inflated exponential kernels; which encompass a basic family of short-distance flight-types for mosquitoes

. In optimizing trap placement, we consider two types of traps with distinct attractiveness profiles represented by: i ) an exponential kernel with a mean radius of attractiveness of 16 m [28], and ii ) a sigmoidal kernel with an inflection radius of 16 m and shape parameter of 0. 25 ( Fig 3A ). Both traps have maximum attractiveness of 0. 5, meaning that, for a trap placed within a population node, the ratio of mosquitoes that enter the trap to those that do not per time-step is 0

. In the event that specific resources are included in a landscape, movement probabilities are modified by a “masking matrix, ” which is determined by the resource type of the mosquito’s current node. For instance, a mosquito currently in a node with blood-feeding resources may be more likely to seek a node with water for egg-laying. This type of movement is similar to that of the MBITES framework ( Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator ) [22]

. MGSurvE makes use of a genetic algorithm ( GA ) to optimize trap placement by calling the DEAP framework ( Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python ) [23], by default. GAs are a subset of evolutionary algorithms that search computational solution space using biologically-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection upon computationally-created “chromosomes, ” which store information about potential solutions to the optimization task at hand [24]

. be/RhYmeJ3XZ_8 ( minutes 28 to 30 ). The operators and selected parameters for the algorithm are described in S1 Text. The resulting trap distributions are depicted in Fig 3B1 and 3B2 ( for the case of the mean expected time for a mosquito to be trapped ) and Fig 3B3 ( for the case of maximum expected time for a mosquito to be trapped )

. Additionally, we can see in Fig 4B and 4C that doubling the number of traps from 5 to 10 has a drastic impact on reducing the mean time taken for mosquitoes to fall into traps ( from 2, 719 to 926 days ). From this point, adding 10 more traps would only reduce the time to 406 days, which may inform cost-effectiveness considerations.

. 5:1 ( i. e., the number of mosquitoes that fall into a trap per unit of time ) for each trap is plotted in Fig 4D. We can see that increasing the number of traps from 5 to 10 results in a significant increase in the number of mosquitoes caught per trap, but adding more traps beyond 10 does not significantly increase the number of mosquitoes caught per trap. This may be due to the fact that the population is relatively small, and the number of mosquitoes that can be caught is limited by the number of traps available

The MGSURVE framework can be used to optimize the placement of traps for other mosquito species, such as Anopheles gambiae on the island of São Tomé Tom and Principe. The island is 225 km west of the coast of Gabon and has been identified as a candidate for field trials of gene drive mosquitoes due to the presence of a single malaria vector species Anopheles gambiae. We use MGSVE to distribute traps in order to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest for Anophe gambiae populations on the island. The landscape is a metapulation with discrete population nodes, and the scale at which populations are modeled depends on the species of interest and the resolution at which trap placement is desired. In this case, a household scale is adequate for Anophe gambia. We considered both discrete and continuous optimization to compare results, although the discrete is preferred due to the fact that traps would be assigned to households without a precise location being specified. The placement of each trap was optimized according to a fitness function to minimize the mean expected time for a mosquito to be trapped, considering all possible origins on the landscape. The GA implemented default mutation and crossover operators, the code for this analysis available in S Text and https://github

Landscape and reports are generated and exported to disk for performance and further analysis. Optimal trap placement can be plotted alongside the distribution of mosquito nodes, with examples in the use section and Figs 2–4

Yor Kn was a site for release of Wolbach-infected mosquitoes in 201 [26] ( Fig 3 ). Aeegi is a relatively disperser, so households serve as an appropriate node for the landscape.5 ( Fig 4 ) We used discrete optimization due the spatial, which traps are likely to be placed localities.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a tiny ( 1. 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote. The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum, however, like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known. We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24, but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses. Instead, numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively ). Using the BpV genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. Overall, we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is associated with giant viruses.

   . However, the identity and functional role of these apparent endobacteria has not been further investigated. To identify the endobacterium and its role in such a small protist, we conducted Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) targeting various groups of bacteria and generated amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data of two strains of S. scintillans. This showed the absence of endobacteria of known endosymbiotic lineages

. The absence of endosymbiotic bacteria in all the sequencing data was further supported by the absence of a bacterial signal using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of all sub-cultures of S. scintillans grown in Canada ( RCC257 ) and Japan ( RCC257-jp ) ( Fig 1 ). We observed the same trend in RCC24-jp ( S2 Fig ) using additional probes targeting Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria

To identify the symbionts of Symbiomonas scintillans, we sequenced two geographically distinct strains ( RCC24 isolated from Pacific Ocean and RCC257 from the Atlantic Ocean ) maintained under culture conditions. In most of our sequencing data, a large representation of the host sequence was found as expected. The exception to this is the WGA data from RCC24, where no host sequences could be identified ( see below )

. Due to the loss of viral signals in RCC257-late and the complete loss of the RCC24 strain, we could not conduct an infection assay or purify lysates. However, given the sequence coverage of prasinoviral reads, completeness of BpV-vMAGs, lack of evidence of green algae in the cultures, and sample processing method, we argue that the SsV vMAGs are indeed directly associated with S. scintillans. This is further supported by the two similar but distinct strains of S

. In all our assembled WGA data, no sequences were assigned to Archaea while the amplification-free shotgun metagenome data had some Archaea contigs with low coverage ( x1-7 ). Instead of endobacteria, we detected contigs assigned to prasinovirus with up to x200 coverage in RCC257 ( S1 Fig and S2 Dataset )

. For example, the only known case of prokaryotic endosymbiosis in non-phototrophic stramenopiles is found in the tiny ( ~1. 4 μm ) bikosia, Symbiomonas scintillans, where two geographically distinct strains were reported to harbour up to 6 endobacteria, and which served as the inspiration for its genus name [17]. The location of these endobacteria within the endoplasmic reticulum was of particular interest, as this is where plastids of phototrophic stramenopiles are located [17, 18]

. scintillans contained two similar but distinct sets of three giant virus genomes. A virus-like particle ( VLP ) from RCC24 was visualized with negative stain TEM ( Fig 2A and 2B ). The VLP exhibited an icosahedral shape with a diameter of 192 nm, which is unusually large compared to previously characterized prasinoviruses [77]. However, it fell within the size range ( 180–240 nm ) of the inclusion described as endobacteria in S. scintillans [17]

., Labrenzia spp., and Hyphomonas spp. were all reported to be common in cultures of Ostreoccocus tauri, Symbiodiniaceae, Alexandrium spp., and discobids [54–60]. Accounting for this overwhelming representation of culture-associated bacteria, a subset of whole-genome amplification ( WGA ) data was selected and reassembled based on lower GC content, which is usually associated with endosymbionts. However, no sequences assigned to endosymbiotic bacterial lineages were detected

., Hyphomonas spp., Balneola spp. ) in addition to Marinovum algicola and a member of Phycisphaeraceae, but no known endosymbiotic lineages nor any draft bacterial genomes with “symbiotic features” such as small genome size, AT-rich content, or rapid sequence evolution could be identified in any of these data

. scintillans [17]. Indeed, the morphology of the “endobacteria” in the original description ( see Fig 1D in [17] ) closely matches that of the VLP in Fig 2A and 2B. We did not observe VLPs in the actively growing RCC257 strain, as expected as the NCLDV reads were no longer detected in RCC257-late. The S. scintillans “endobacteria” were also described to be located within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ), which continues as perinuclear space of a nuclear envelope [17]

. When viral-subset-scaffolds were re-assembled and further scaffolded using a reference-guide approach, we recovered three viral metagenomically assembled genomes ( vMAGs ) related to the prasinovirus genera, Bathycoccus prasinos virus 2 ( BpV2 ), Ostreococcus lucimarinus virus 1 ( OlV1 ), and Micromonas pusilla virus Pl1 ( MpV_Pl1 ). The completeness of vMAGs were the highest for the BpV2-guided assembly ( BpV2-vMAG ), with 100% completeness

. Two strains of S. scintillans ( RCC24 and RCC257 ) maintained at UBC were subject to WGA sequencing and one strain RCC24-jp, maintained at OIST was subject to amplification-free shotgun metagenomic sequencing. To prepare a WGA library of the isolated cells, a 4BBTM TruePrime Single Cell WGA Kit was used following a manufacturer’s protocol with 12 h incubation at 30°C for the amplification reaction step

. Additionally, some bacterial lineages have evolved to be “professional symbionts” [6] such as Chlamydiae, Rickettsiales, and Holosporales, consisting entirely of obligate endosymbionts or intracellular parasites of eukaryotic hosts [6, 14–16]. Despite these impacts, most prokaryotic symbionts of eukaryotes are poorly studied, generally only observed with microscopy, and left unidentified and uncharacterized

. Given the original description of this taxon suggested these symbionts were bacterial, we first searched for bacterial reads assigned to well-known endosymbiotic lineages such as Rickettsiales, Holosporales, or Chlamydiae in all the analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data

. The same searches were repeated on amplification-free shotgun metagenomic data, WGA data from RCC257-late, NIES-2589 ( RCC24-jp ), and ORF-predicted transcriptome data however, neither prasinovirus nor NCLDV reads were detected. Aside from microscopic observation, to confirm the absence of green algae contamination in the culture, we searched for small subunits of ribosomal RNA ( SSU rRNA ) in all sequencing data using barrnap v0. 9 ( 32 )

. First, it is possible that inclusions originally described are endobacteria that are still present, but were not detectable in genomic analyses, or belong to one of the normally free-living endosymbion lineages. However, the morphology of the VLP in Fig 2A and 2 closely matches that of the endob in the original description [17 ] and the VLPs were not observed in the actively growing RCC strain, as NCL reads were no longer detected in RCC-late. We conclude that S.intans does not harbour an endosymb bacterium, but is associated with prasiniruses

The authors conclude that S. scill does not harbour an endosymb bacterium but is associated with prasiniruses.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function, highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform, LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense, or frameshift, mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular mechanism which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant protein expression. Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies.

   . Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LMOD3, the isoform predominant in skeletal muscle, result in nemaline myopathy, a skeletal muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness ( there are >20 mutations reported to date ) [2–6]. Additionally, disease causing mutations have been found in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2. We reported the first known case of a mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ) that results in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) [7]

. In the case of the patient with the first described disease-causing mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ), LMOD2 protein was not detected in the explanted heart via western blot analysis and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in mature LMOD2 mRNA levels, but no change in pre-mRNA levels [7]. Thus, we hypothesized that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) underlies loss of mutant protein expression. Two additional LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( p. R513* and p

. In this study we discovered that multiple human LMOD2 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy lead to a lack of LMOD2 protein expression through NMD. We also developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides to specifically inhibit NMD of LMOD2 transcripts, increasing the levels of mutant-truncated protein.

. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) [9]. All data to date suggest that Lmod-linked muscle diseases have the common underlying pathophysiology of short thin filaments, reduced muscle contractility and severe muscle weakness. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD family of genes are nonsense or frameshift mutations which are predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in most cases, little to no LMOD protein is expressed [1, 2, 7]

. However, degradation of mutant transcripts containing premature termination codons by NMD could limit the effectiveness of stop-readthrough drugs. Thus, treatment with an SBO that inhibits NMD in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2

In this study we developed an experimental system to directly test the effect of human LMOD2 disease causing mutations on the expression and stability of LMOD2 protein. To date, four distinct LMOD2 mutations have been discovered in individuals from five separate families that all present with early onset dilated cardiomyopathy [7–11]. By analyzing explanted hearts we previously found that two of the mutations ( p. W398* and c

. Multiple lines of evidence point to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) as the underlying cause of loss of LMOD2 protein due to the W398* and R513* mutations. First, the mutations only result in a large decrease in protein levels when expressed from constructs containing an intron, indicating that significant loss of mutant protein is not due to a defect at the level of the protein

. This study was performed in a human cell line that does not express detectable levels of LMOD2 to facilitate analysis of LMOD2 gene constructs containing patient mutations. Thus, further research is needed to determine the extent of NMD, and the effectiveness of steric-blocking oligonucleotides, in patient-derived cardiomyocytes.

. W398* ) live significantly longer than Lmod2 knockout mice, but display dilated cardiomyopathy and die prematurely as adults ( Iwanski et al., in preparation ). Alternatively, combination of SBO treatment with drugs that promote translational readthrough of premature termination codons could prove therapeutically synergistic. Greater than 50 compounds that promote stop-readthrough have been discovered and are in various stages of therapeutic development [29]

. Furthermore, introduction of mouse GFP-Lmod2 with a mutation ( W405* ) homologous to the W398* mutation found in the first patient identified ( generated from cDNA so it is not susceptible to degradation due to NMD ) partially restores cardiac morphology and function in Lmod2 KO mice [7]. Therefore, recovery of mutant protein expression, even at low levels, could potentially improve cardiac function in some cases of DCM due to mutations in LMOD2

The leiomodin ( LMOD ) family of actin-binding proteins are critical for proper function of all types of muscle in humans. A biallelic mutation in LMOD1, the smooth muscle-specific LMOD family member, leads to megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles that line the bladder and intestine [1]

. Thus, while recovery of mutant protein expression, due to successful inhibition of NMD, is predicted to improve cardiac function and could potentially provide the patient with additional time to receive other therapies or a cardiac transplant, it is not expected to provide a cure since it is likely that fully-functional protein is not made. Supporting this conclusion, transgenic mice expressing the homologous mutation ( p. W405* ) to that first discovered to cause disease in humans ( p

. The reason for the increase in pre-mRNA levels is not clear, but could result from altered pre-mRNA processing and/or degradation [28]. All of the LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( should they be expressed ) result in proteins missing varying degrees of their C-termini, which includes one of the three known actin-binding sites of LMOD2

. Mutant LMOD2 MG pre-mRNA levels are not significantly different than WT pre-mRNA levels ( Fig 2A ). This indicates that loss of LMOD2 is occurring post-transcriptionally. Activation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) requires an initial round of translation, therefore blocking translation should result in the accumulation of transcripts containing PTCs, if NMD indeed contributes to loss of mature mutant LMOD2 transcript

. Fourth, inhibition of a known mechanism through which NMD functions ( the presence of an exon junction complex downstream of a premature termination codon ) partially recovers mutant protein levels. We previously found that introduction of GFP-Lmod2 into Lmod2 KO mice just after birth prevents onset of DCM, with the mice living to adulthood [21]. We also determined that a surprisingly small amount of Lmod2 ( ~15% of endogenous levels ) is required to maintain function [22]

. RNA associated with the complex ( or in the input lysate ) was isolated, cDNA generated and RT-qPCR used to quantify transcript levels. Analysis of RIP input lysate revealed an increase in LMOD2 MG[W398*] transcript levels following treatment with SBO L2[-38] compared to treatment with a scrambled SBO, consistent with inhibition of NMD ( Fig 4G )

. Protein expression of constructs with and without patient mutations was analyzed in a human cell line ( AD-293, which are derived from HEK293 cells ) that does not express detectable levels of LMOD2 protein via western blot analysis, providing an LMOD2-free background in which to study the effect of mutations on LMOD2 protein levels

. Thus, we chose to employ steric-blocking oligonucleotides ( SBOs ) to take advantage of the specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing with the goal of only targeting the LMOD2 transcript by blocking a single EJC binding site downstream of the PTC. Three of the four SBOs ( L2[–30], L2[–34], and L2[–38] effectively increased mutant LMOD2 protein expression. One SBO did not recover mutant LMOD2 protein or mature mRNA levels and resulted in an apparent increase in LMOD2 pre-mRNA levels

. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) are predicted to produce truncated proteins, however information is lacking regarding whether, and to what extent, protein is expressed [9, 10]. NMD is a surveillance system whereby the cell detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons ( PTCs ), however NMD also regulates the levels of certain non-mutated, functional transcripts [12, 13]

. Conversely, the mutation results in a significant decrease in LMOD2 protein levels when introduced into constructs containing introns ( MG and G ) ( ~20–30% of wild type [WT] levels, Fig 1B ). Protein levels are reduced to the same extent in the presence or absence of the intron, indicating that loss of mutant protein is not due to a defect at the level of the protein.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2, 3, or 4 ). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology.

    Compared to the neutral ApoE3 allele, expression of ApoE4 significantly increases the risk for Alzheimers, while the expression of ApoE2 is moderately protective [5, 8, 12, 22, 25, 27–29]. Here we investigate the etiology of these differences by measuring ApoE-dependent changes in protein homeostasis ( proteostasis ) in the tissues of human-ApoE transgenic mice ( Fig 1A ). Proteostasis is the dynamic control of concentration and quality [19, 30–32] in the cell

In this study, we demonstrated how combining protein abundance and turnover rate unveils the cellular regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. Utilizing proteomics data, we compared ontology-level variations due to ApoE genotypes in healthy adult mice. Our findings present in vivo evidence that harmonizes with existing literature, linking brain ApoE4-dependent changes in endosomal trafficking, autophagy, proteasome activity, and lower mitochondrial quality

. Concurrently, our data suggests that ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover in tandem with a corresponding increase in proteolysis capacity in the brain ( Fig 6 ). Future work investigating ApoE-dependent modification of region-specific lipid transport or protein-protein interactions will be necessary to elucidate the key initiating variables causing these proteostatic changes.

. Both ApoE2 and E4 modulate disease risk relative to ApoE3. For example, Ferrer et al. [5] observed a ~5-fold increase in Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ) prevalence in carriers of the ApoE4 allele relative to ApoE3 carriers and a decreased risk ( ~0. 5 fold ) in individuals expressing the ApoE2 allele

. Our findings also substantiate the ApoE4-associated dysregulation of MAM structures [22, 51, 52], which potentially results in disrupted mitochondrial morphology and impaired energy production. Our working hypothesis postulates that ApoE4 expression reduces autophagy and proteasomal activity, diminishing capacity to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. ApoE is an important lipid transporter to many parts of the body, not just the brain

. We apply a simplified kinetic model of proteostasis ( Figs 1B and B in S1 File ) combining turnover rate and concentration data to reveal ApoE isoform-dependent regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. We investigated the liver and brain, because there is strong evidence that of the ~16 major apolipoproteins, only ApoA1 can cross the blood brain barrier. [16] So although chemically identical, ApoE is found in two separate pools

. Additionally, we theorize, as described in the literature [17, 21, 22, 44, 53], that the disparate attempts at protein replacement in ApoE4 mitochondria culminate in dysfunction. There is an increasing body of research on ApoE genotype-specific effects in ATP production [54–56] which links compromised bioenergetic pathways to neurodegeneration [57–60]. Several studies highlight an ApoE4-related shift towards glycolysis and diminished oxygen consumption in brain tissues

. Although ApoE2 protects against Alzheimer’s Disease, it increases risk for cardiovascular disease [18]. This leads us to question if the mechanism by which ApoE2 protects against Alzheimer’s, may be detrimental and disease causing to other tissues. To understand if ApoE elicits a global response across all tissue, we tested and analyzed the liver tissue from our experimental mice in the same manner as the brain. The changes in ApoE2/E3 liver and brain proteostasis were not equivalent

. These results suggest that ApoE4-tissue relied on replacement of individual components within the mitochondria to maintain homeostasis. In contrast, ApoE2 mice increased degradation of mitochondrial membrane ontologies with a matching increase in the degradation of the matrix proteins

. Because mouse ApoE has a low sequence identity ( 77% ) and a different transcription promoter, the human ApoE3 model is the best control for comparison. While we recognize the limits of a transgenic model, this study provides valuable identification of in vivo patterns which can be confirmed in future ApoE knock-in mice models and human studies. These results refer solely to the effects of ApoE isoform differences, rather than Alzheimer’s Disease

. The proteasome also plays a major role in the mitochondrial quality control, by degrading excess or misfolded proteins that disrupt mitochondrial activity [65], and saving cells from misfolding stress response. [66] Reduced proteasome activity has consistently been implicated as a major player in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration [21, 25, 26, 67, 68]. ApoE2 has been shown to directly inhibit the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) to decrease Aβ peptide formation

. Similarly, ApoE4/E3 liver and ApoE4/E3 brain proteostasis changes in the endosome, metabolism, and proteasome pathways in the brain are not similar between tissues ( see S4 and S5 Tables ). However, significant effects of ApoE4 regarding the mitochondria between the liver and brain contained several of the same proteostasis changes, suggesting there may be some degree of shared effects due to ApoE4

. This implies larger proteasome pool in ApoE4, albeit with more regulation. Our data on proteasomal and lysosomal regulation in ApoE4 are in agreement with existing literature [33, 78], suggesting that suboptimal endocytic regulation might directly impact autophagy and the proteasomal maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis

. Some mechanistic details have been identified for how the ApoE alleles modulate an individual’s risk for disease. ApoE is a transporter of amyloidβ [10–13], a widely recognized biomarker in AD development. ApoE-isoforms modulate brain mRNA expression, presumably in response to changes in lipid availability[14] as well as direct transcriptional effects

. [69]while ApoE4 may promote its accumulation. [10, 13, 70–72] This buildup of Aβ has been shown to directly inhibit proteasome function leading to increased accumulation of amyloid plaques. [73, 74] Proteasome function can also be disrupted by mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, oxidation of the 26S subunit of the proteasome due to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress has been shown to increase the accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates and decrease proteasomal activity [75]

. These changes suggest a significant reduction in the proteasome-dependent protein quality control for ApoE4 tissue ( Fig 5C ). The liver is the largest producer of ApoE in the body and is also a major receptor of ApoE and its associated cargo [8, 18, 24]. Therefore, we tested whether the liver tissue from these same experimental mice would show matching ApoE allele-specific shifts in proteome regulation

. Most changes in the mitochondria in the liver with ApoE2 expression involve increased degradation of mitochondrial components, though there is some reduced synthesis for the mitochondrial envelope and transmembrane transport. Liver ApoE2 also did not shift proteasome-related ontologies in the same manner as the brain

. In contrast, the ApoE4 tissues show discordant changes in matrix versus membrane proteins suggesting that mitochondrial maintenance is more piecemeal and that mitophagy may be less efficient as previously suggested in the literature [21]. Both the ApoE2 and the ApoE4 results are synergistic with the changes in lysosome dynamics discussed above

Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) is one of the lipoproteins used for the transport of lipids and cholesterol throughout the body and the primary transporter in the brain. The three major subtypes of human ApoE—ApoE2, ApE3, and ApE4—differentially modulate the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with ApE4 increasing and Ap2 decreasing relative to ApE3 [5, 8 12, 22 25 , 27 29]. We investigated how ApE isoforms modulate protein homeostasis ( proteasis ) in the brain and liver of transgenic mice expressing the human ApE gene isoform 2, 3, or 4 ( Fig 1 ) Proteasis is the dynamic control of protein concentration and quality [19 30–32] in the cell. We found that ApE and ApE lead to regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type ApE in the brain, with ApE lacking cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing protein quality. ApE proteins of the matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had increased degradation suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. The liver did not observe these changes suggesting the ApE effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues Our findings underscore the utility combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology

This text is a summary of a scientific research article about the relationship between apolipoprotein E (Apo) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study used transgenic mice expressing human Apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4 to investigate how Apo isoforms alter protein homeostasis in the brain and liver. The study found that Apo4 and Ap2 lead to regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type Ap3 in the brain, with Ap4 lacking cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing quality. Ap2 proteins of the matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had increased degradation suggesting coordinated replacement of the organel. The liver did not observe these changes suggesting the Apo effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. The study also found that Ap2 increased degradation of mitochondrial ontologies with a matching increase in degradation of matrix proteins.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development. However, this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues, including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ). To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system, here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. Thus, we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. 

    Supporting Text:
   . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes, such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion [18–20]. Although CRISPR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at the NMJ [21], tissue-specific CRISPR has not yet been successfully applied to the fly NMJ. NMJs are special synaptic connections formed between motor neurons and somatic muscles [22]

. Altogether, the above results demonstrate that Cas9 expressed by motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells can result in efficient tissue-specific gene KO for studying motoneuron development and NMJ biology. To investigate NMJ morphogenesis with CRISPR-TRiM, we next examined the role of the secretory pathway mediated by SNARE proteins

To apply CRISPR-TRiM in tissues relevant to NMJ biology, we generated several Cas9 lines that are expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles ( S1A Fig ) by Gal4-to-Cas9 conversion [10], enhancer-fusion [9], or CRISPR-mediated knock-in ( KI ). For motoneurons, we generated wor-Cas9, which should be active in neuronal progenitor cells [32], and three lines ( OK371-Cas9, OK6-Cas9, and OK319-Cas9 ) that should be expressed in post-mitotic motoneurons [10, 33–36]

Tissue-specific mutagenesis by CRISPR is a powerful approach for dissecting gene functions in animal development [1, 4, 9–12, 14–16, 72]. This approach directly disrupts the coding sequence of, and thus knocks out, the gene of interest in specific somatic cells. However, its successful application in the Drosophila NMJ system has not been demonstrated previously

. Together, the above data suggest that SNARE-mediated secretory pathways are required for structural establishment or maintenance of NMJs and that CRISPR-TRiM can reveal LOF phenotype of essential and redundant genes at the NMJ. Drosophila motoneurons release extracellular vesicles into the synaptic cleft at NMJs

. In this study, we developed a Cas9 collection for applying CRISPR-TRiM in motor neurons, somatic muscles, and glia cells, the three principal cell types that make up the NMJ. Using these tools, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene KO in each tissue and reveal the role of the SNARE pathway in NMJ maintenance and the roles of the ESCRT pathway in NMJ morphogenesis. Compared to LOF by RNAi, the CRISPR-TRiM method offers two major advantages

. For glial cells, we previously made repo-Cas9 [10]; for this study, we also generated gcm-Cas9 by inserting Cas9 into the glial cells missing ( gcm ) locus through CRISPR-mediated KI ( S1A and S1B Fig ). gcm-Cas9 is predicted to be active in glial progenitor cells [37, 38]. Lastly, we made a muscle-specific mef2-Cas9 by converting mef2-Gal4 [10] ( S1A Fig ). To evaluate the mutagenesis efficiency in motoneurons, we generated a Cas9 negative tester nSyb-tdGFP; gRNA-GFP

. One example is the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) pathway [31], which comprises five distinct complexes ( ESCRTs -0, -I, -II, and -III, and Vps4 ) that sequentially sort monoubiquitinated membrane cargo and mediate membrane fission in late endosomes and at the plasma membrane. In this study, we generated a tissue-specific CRISPR toolkit for knocking out genes in motor neurons, glia, and somatic muscles, the three cell types of the Drosophila NMJ

. Because many SNARE genes play essential housekeeping functions in all cells, we reason that their LOF in motoneurons should result in morphological defects at the NMJ. In addition, because these genes are expected to be expressed early in neuronal lineages and are prone to perdurance, testing them with CRISPR-TRiM may reveal differences in the timing of action among the Cas9 drivers in motoneurons

. Although tissue-specific CRISPR can be very effective for studying gene function, its successful application has been limited to a small number of Drosophila tissues, including the germline [1, 8], sensory neurons [9–12], prothoracic gland [13], mushroom body neurons [14], imaginal tissues [7, 9, 10], epidermal cells [9, 10], circadian neurons [15, 16] and cardiomyocytes [17]

. This toolkit is based on CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ), a method using tissue-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitously expressed gRNAs to knock out genes in the desired tissue [9]. We validated the efficacy of gene knock-out ( KO ) in each of the three tissues. Using these tools, we examined the roles of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) pathway and the ESCRT machinery in NMJ morphogenesis

. Unlike Gal4-dependent CRISPR strategies [1, 7], the tissue-specific Cas9s in our CRISPR-TRiM method can be used orthogonally with binary expression systems, as exemplified by simultaneous TSG101 KO in neurons and tissue-specific KD of gbb. Thus, the tools we reported here enable a versatile CRISPR toolkit to analyze gene function in the NMJ system

. The efficiency of muscle-specific mef2-Cas9 was evaluated using gRNAs for two Drosophila muscle-specific glutamate receptor subunits, GluRIIA and GluRIIB. In both cases, mef2-Cas9 efficiently eliminated expression of these proteins in muscle fibers ( Fig 2B and 2C ). CRISPR-TRiM generated comparable or stronger reduction than RNAi-induced knockdown ( KD ) as assayed by immunostaining ( Fig 2E and 2F )

. To evaluate the efficiency of gene KO in the motor system using CRISPR-TRiM, we generated or obtained ubiquitously expressed gRNAs for several well-studied genes and crossed them to appropriate Cas9 lines. We compared the efficiency of wor-Cas9, OK6-Cas9, and OK371-Cas9 in knocking out Synaptotagmin 1 ( Syt1 ) ( Fig 2A ), which encodes a transmembrane Ca2+ sensor for synchronous synaptic vesicle fusion [40]. Crossing to wor-Cas9 resulted in 49

Characterization of developmental mechanisms often involves loss-of-function ( LOF ) analysis of genes in organisms. Besides the more traditional methods of LOF, such as whole-organismal mutations and RNA interference ( RNAi ), tissue-specific mutagenesis through the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as another powerful approach [1–5]

. In these animals, the glia wrapping motoneuron axons formed enlarged compartments that were absent in repo-Cas9 controls ( Fig 2G and 2H ) resulting in a greater ratio between the maximal and minimal widths of the glial tract ( Figs 2I and S2D ). These results suggest that repo-Cas9 can efficiently induce biallelic mutations of two genes simultaneously in glia

. To determine the efficiency of repo-Cas9, we used previously published gRNAs targeting both comatose ( comt or Nsf1 ) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor 2 ( Nsf2 ) [9], which encode two redundant NSF proteins involved in disassembly of SNARE complexes after vesicle fusion [41, 42]. repo-C9 eliminated expression of both proteins in glial cells ( Fig 2J and 2K )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae. During larval stages, the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential to prime them for differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. Intriguingly, despite having ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. Using expression analyses, genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches, we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK. Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. Our study sheds light on how, during development, integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development.

   . Although the presence of relish can be detected in the embryonic lymph gland ( [55] Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, [56, 57] ) it is intriguing how its expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool. Interestingly, our study also demonstrates that overexpressing Rel in progenitor cells can lead to the downregulation of FAO. The negative regulation of NF-κB signaling over Fatty acid oxidation has been reported in various disease conditions

. It is intriguing how this reserve population within the lymph gland is intercepted from precociously inducting into the differentiation program. Studies have shown that developmentally regulated, moderately high Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) levels in the blood progenitor cells of the Drosophila mature lymph gland elicit c-Jun Kinase ( JNK ) to facilitate their differentiation [12]. Recent studies have also shown that the JNK-FAO axis is essential for progenitor differentiation [13]

. Our study reveals that Drosophila NF-κB factor Relish expresses strongly in the ROS-enriched progenitors and wanes as the cells move towards differentiation during development ( Fig 7E’-7E” ). We further show that genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors lead to the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, coaxing them to differentiate

. While Rel expression wanes down in the edges of the MZ, the inhibition on TAK1 is lost. The absence of this restrains on TAK1 results in sustained JNK activation, which impinges on FAO and facilitates progenitor differentiation. The NF-κB/Relish is a crucial transcription factor in the Drosophila immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway, activating antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) transcription to combat gram-negative bacterial infections, effectively generating an inflammatory response

. However, different molecules are proposed to act as the mediators to catalyze this inhibition [53, 54]. Previous biochemical analysis in S2 cells [41] and genetic studies in the Drosophila hematopoietic niche [21] has pinpointed that Rel inhibits TAK1 to control JNK activation. Our genetic data show that during development, Rel inhibits TAK1 to dampen JNK activation, thereby preventing precocious differentiation of the ROS-enriched myeloid-like progenitors

. NF-κB regulates vertebrate hematopoiesis through the transcription of genes involved in HSC fate [62] and is known to play a crucial role in HSC emergence from the homogenic endothelium [63]. The process of blood cell development in Drosophila shares several similarities with vertebrates [1, 2, 28, 64–66]. Additionally, like Drosophila, the vertebrate myeloid progenitors are enriched in ROS [12, 67]

. These observations indicated a possible defect in fatty acid oxidation, which has been linked downstream to JNK facilitating progenitor differentiation [13]. Since Rel loss of function and gain of function alter JNK activity, we decided to check the status of the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO withered ( whd, Drosophila homolog of CPT1: Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 ), in lymph gland progenitors in the above-mentioned genetic backgrounds

. Downregulation of FAO and subsequent reduction in H3K9 acetylation can be evidenced upon overexpression of Rel in the progenitors compared to the control. Relish ( Rel ) is also known to govern lipid metabolism during metabolic adaptation in the Drosophila fat body. In order to restrain fasting-induced lipolysis and conserve cellular TAG levels, Rel-mediated repression of histone acetylation marks like H3K9 has been reported [59]

. Collectively, these experiments further endorsed the involvement of FAO downstream of Rel function on the blood progenitors of the larval lymph gland. As mentioned earlier, FAO acts downstream of JNK pathway to drive the differentiation program [13]. Our earlier results clearly showed that modulation of Rel expression regulates FAO activity in the progenitors ( Fig 4A and 4B ). So, the ectopic differentiation observed in Rel loss from the progenitors can result from increased FAO

Drosophila third-instar lymph gland houses a pool of primed progenitors arrested in the G2- M phase of the cell cycle. It has been evidenced ROS primes the progenitors for differentiation ( Fig 7A–7A’ ). Interestingly, long before the G2-M arrest sets in, ROS can be detected in the developing progenitors ( Fig 7B–7D ). Earlier work has demonstrated that the ROS act as the differentiation signal to elicit differentiation by activating JNK-FAO axis [13]

. In Drosophila, Mammalian MAP3 kinase homolog, TAK1 interweaves two pathways that lead to Relish activation and JNK signaling [35–37]. Following immune stimulation, TAK1 activates both the JNK and NF-κB pathways [38–40]. It has also been elucidated that Relish, once activated upon bacterial infection, leads to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, thereby limiting JNK signaling to prevent hyper-immune activation [41]

. In contrast, overexpression of Rel resulted in a 0. 76-fold ( 76% ) decrease in puc expression ( Fig 3A and 3B ), unravelling the activation of JNK downstream to Rel perturbation. Interestingly, loss of basket ( bsk, Drosophila orthologue of Jun-Kinase ) from the progenitors is known to prevent their differentiation [12, 13], similar to what we observe in Rel overexpression ( Compare Figs 3E and 1O )

. The outcome of the above study demonstrated how cellular signaling machinery collaborates with the metabolic cue to enable the differentiation program. However, it does not take into account how the stockpile of ROS-enriched progenitors is maintained. Here, we show that the metabolic input in the form of ROS is monitored by a developmental signal, which shields the bulk of ROS enriched progenitors from inducting into the differentiation process

. Our work demonstrates that Relish in the ROS-enriched progenitors prevents the activation of JNK, thereby deferring their differentiation. The observation that Relish is responsible for preventing JNK activation demands a node at which the JNK signaling is sensitive to the negative regulation of Relish. The antagonistic relation between NF-κB and JNK is highly conserved across divergent taxa [52, 53]

. UAS GFP expression [22]. As evident from the figure, MZ progenitors ( Ance+Pxn- ) express high levels of Relish throughout larval development compared to the CZ ( Fig 1B–1E’ and 1F ). The early onset of Rel expression, along with the differential labeling in the mature lymph gland, prompted us to investigate the role of Rel in blood progenitors during development

. Interestingly Rel has been shown to evoke mir-317 to fine-tune PGRP-LC expression as well as AMPs in adult flies. This leads to suppressing immune over-activation and restoring immune homeostasis [70]. Apart from cellular signalling pathways and growth factors, cellular metabolism has been majorly implicated in stem and progenitor cell fate determination in recent years

. Although the Imd/IMD pathway has been studied intensively in immunity and inflammation, its role during fly development has only recently been unraveled. Studies have elucidated the non-inflammatory roles of Relish ( Rel ) in Drosophila neurodegeneration [14–16], apoptosis [17] and autophagy in salivary gland cells [18]

. Our research has unveiled an intriguing developmental role of Relish, demonstrating its function in maintaining blood progenitors. Employing genetic, molecular and pharmacological studies demonstrate how a metabolic input is calibrated by a developmental signal downstream to Relish to prevent the differentiation program from becoming prodigal ( Fig 7F )

. Interestingly, in the absence of infection, persistent activation of IMD in Drosophila intestinal stem cell progenitors increases the frequency of cell death [71]. In contrast, in our study, loss of Rel leads to precocious differentiation of the progenitors. This suggests that the role of Rel in progenitor differentiation is distinct from its function in the IMD pathway

Our study shows that Rel in the progenitors prevents the activation of the J-FA axis, which is essential for differentiation [12, 13]. We also found that loss of Rel in the progenitors leads to the activation of the J-FA cascade, resulting in precocious differentiation ( Figs 3 and 4 ). The role of Rel in progenitor differentiation is distinct from its function in the IMD pathway, where it is involved in antimicrobial peptide transcription [70]. Our results demonstrate that Relish is crucial for maintaining the pool of ROS-primed progenitors in the larval lymph gland, preventing them from precocious differentiation

In conclusion, our study highlights the role of NF-κ factor Rel in maintaining the pool of ROS-primed progenitors in the larval lymph gland, preventing their precocious differentiation. We show that Rel prevents the activation of the J-FA axis, which is essential for differentiation [12, 13 ] and demonstrate that loss of Rel leads to precocious differentiation ( Figs 3 and 4 ). The role of Rel in progenitor is distinct from its function in the IMD pathway, where it is involved in antimicrobial transcription [70 ]. Our results indicate that Rel is crucial for maintaining the pool of ROSprimed progenitors in the larval gland, preventing precocious differentiation. This study sheds light on how during development, integrating NFκ-like factors with metabolic pathways crucial regulating cell fate transition during development

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers investigated the role of the NF-κ factor Rel in maintaining the pool of ROS-primed progenitors in the larval lymph gland of Drosophila. They found that Rel prevents the activation of the J-FA axis, which is essential for differentiation, and that loss of Rel leads to precocious differentiation. The role of Rel in progenitor is distinct from its function in the IMD pathway, where it is involved in antimicrobial transcription. The study highlights the importance of integrating NF-like factors with metabolic pathways in regulating cell fate during development.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene. Its transcript, the small nuclear RNA U4atac, is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns. Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC, instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A>G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts, we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest and cell death. In cortical organoids, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes, by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC. Altogether, these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly.

   . 2953A>G further through the study of various cellular models, which provided us with insights in the molecular mechanisms of disease associated with Taybi-Linder syndrome. As previously described [20, 24, 29], RTTN c. 2953A>G variant, located at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 23, alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23. We first confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing that c

In this article, we investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c. 2953A>G variant identified in a patient with a Taybi-Linder-like syndrome, in fibroblasts derived from the patient, and for the first time, in human iPSC-derived neuronal models

. Here, we report on a patient with clinical features of TALS but no variants in RNU4ATAC. Whole exome sequencing rather revealed she has the homozygous pathogenic missense variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G, p. Arg985Gly, which also alters splicing. This gene has already been implicated in human disease, notably “microcephaly, short stature and polymicrogyria with or without seizure” ( MSSP, OMIM #614833 )

. For that, we used patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) that were differentiated into neural stem cells ( NSC ) or cortical organoids ( CO ). We carried out a thorough analysis of the impact of the RTTN isoforms resulting from the mutated allele identified in the patient and conducted cellular studies of the centrosome/primary cilium complex and their related functions. Overall, our results establish how RTTN c

. Despite some inconsistencies between clones, we brought out a general trend regarding cellular consequences downstream RTTN c. 2953A>G. We demonstrated that RTTN-mutated NSC accumulated in G2-M phase due to numerous mitotic abnormalities that likely results in aneuploidy, cell arrest or cell apoptosis ( Fig 4A–4H ). These mitotic defects were associated to slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles that may favour a premature differentiation of NSC into neurons ( Fig 4I and 4J )

. A comprehensive analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC phenotypes showed no significant differences between WT and RTTN mutated ( KI ) clones regarding cell cycle progression ( S6A and S6B Fig ), mitotic events ( S6C and S6D Fig ), percentage of ciliated cells and cilium length ( S6E–S6G Fig ). The iPSC were then differentiated into neural stem cells ( NSC ) ( S7A–S7C Fig )

. Indeed, the organization of NSC into neural rosettes resembles the developmental structures of neural tubes. First, to check if the splicing outcomes of RTTN pre-mRNA with c. 2953A>G variant was modified in the context of an increased cellular complexity, we analyzed the RNA isoforms in DIV35 CO. We found the same three isoforms as before, in almost the same proportions as in fibroblasts and NSC, except that the FL isoform was less abundant ( S9D and S9E Fig )

. A few patients only were deceased at the time of publication, with one third of them having reached teenage- or adulthood. RTTN encodes the large centrosomal protein Rotatin ( 2, 226 amino-acids ), and was initially discovered by a forward genetic screen in the mouse model, with the particular phenotype of Rttn mutant embryos failing to undergo the axial rotation during embryogenesis [34]

. Further investigations demonstrated that Rotatin is essential for procentriole elongation [35], correct cell cycle progression and mitosis [29, 36], and regulation of primary cilium length [18, 29]. Alterations of some of these processes have been shown to contribute to the development of microcephaly [37]. Intrigued by the TALS-like phenotype of the patient with this RTTN variant, we thought to investigate the associated pathophysiological mechanisms leading to microcephaly

. She is currently aged 17 and has a neurological follow-up for cognitive impairment and epilepsy treated with valproate, clobazam and olanzapine. Because of the clinical suspicion of TALS, Sanger sequencing of RNU4ATAC was first performed, but no variant was found. Then, whole exome sequencing was done and the homozygous variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G was identified ( ClinVar #977819, reported as pathogenic ), in a gene that does not contain any minor intron

. The two baby boys died before 3 months of age. Of note, all the other RTTN published cases present with quite heterogeneous clinical presentations, distinct from the TALS phenotype ( Fig 1D and S1 Table ). Since the pathophysiological mechanisms by which damaging RTTN variants impact brain development are poorly known, we investigated RTTN c

The Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ), or MOPD1 ( OMIM #210710 ), is a very rare genetic disease with less than 100 reported cases [1–6] characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth delay, severe microcephaly with brain abnormalities ( abnormal gyral pattern, intracranial cyst, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis ), intellectual deficiency, bone abnormalities, bulging eyes and dry skin with eczema, as well as a premature death during the first months of life

. This result suggests that a higher proportion of KI NSC could be prone to undergo asymmetric divisions and thus to prematurely shift to neurogenic cell divisions, which, as a result, would exhaust the progenitor pool and lead to microcephaly [39, 44, 45]. We generated matrix-free cortical organoids ( CO ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC ( S9A–S9C Fig ), in order to mimic, in three dimensions, the early stages of brain development

. Since the identification of RNU4ATAC in 2011 [10, 11], no other gene has been associated with this disease. RNU4ATAC is a non-coding gene transcribed into the small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) U4atac, a component of the minor spliceosome. This ribonucleic complex excises less than one percent of all human introns [12], and deficiency in its function leads in most cases to minor intron retention that impairs the correct maturation of about 750 minor-intron containing transcripts [2, 13–17]

. Overall, our results establish how RTTN c. 2953A>G variant affects the integrity of the neural stem cell pool, thus leading to improper neuronal cell mass in patients.

. Not surprisingly, given the severe brain malformations associated with RTTN variants, the most striking phenotypes were detected in the neural progenitor cells, cultured in 2D or 3D. It is of importance to note that clonal variability was observed in these models, highlighting the necessity to analyse several clones or to restore polyclonality by mixing several iPS clones

. All these alterations contribute to NSC pool reduction, thus leading to the microcephaly seen in the patient we describe here and probably, in most patients having RTTN variants. The RTTN c. 2953A>G variant is present in a total of 5 out of 40 reported cases ( in 4 out of 24 families ), who all originate from North Africa, thus suggesting a founder effect ( Fig 1D, and S1 Table ) [20, 24, 29]

. Up to now, 39 patients from 23 families have been reported with bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RTTN [20, 24, 29, 31, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 76, 77 78, 79 80, 81, 82 83, 84 85, 86, 87 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97 98, 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400

    Title: 
    Abstract: Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species, Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion, by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ). In July 2015, we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP. In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media, but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment. Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments, we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation. First, we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically, up to six years under resource exhaustion, through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We further show that upon entry into LTSP, long-lasting lineages are established. This lineage structure is in itself convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP, combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure, enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of a historical contingency. We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association. Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency.

    Our results show that E. coli adaptation under LTSP continues via highly convergent mutation accumulation at least up to six years into our experiments. We were able to discern the lineage structure of our populations, demonstrating that it is in itself convergent. This means that across populations similar lineages, established by the acquisition of the same lineage defining RNAPC mutations, emerge. Lineages defined by the same RNAPC mutation often behave similarly across populations

. Finally, convergent mutation acquisition was also observed in the LTEE, with different populations often accumulating mutations to similar loci [8, 22, 24–26]. In July of 2015, we initiated our own long-term evolutionary experiment, designed to study E. coli adaptation under prolonged external resource exhaustion [27, 28]. E

. coli to consume and even grow on butyrate [39]. Two non-trivial aspects of the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP enabled us to utilize data extracted from LTSP evolutionary experiments to identify pairs of putatively contingent loci. The first such aspect is the remarkable convergence with which adaptation occurs within our LTSP populations. Adaptation via convergently occurring mutations is a feature of many evolutionary experiments [17–19]

. E. coli and many other non-sporulating bacteria are able to survive long periods of resource exhaustion, following brief periods of growth, by entering a state of growth termed long term stationary phase ( LTSP ) [27, 29–32]. In our LTSP experiment, five populations of E. coli K12 MG1655 were established by inoculating cells into 400 ml of fresh rich media. Each population was established from an individual clone

. 7% of the E. coli genome. Mutations continue to occur more often than expected by chance in loci mutated across multiple populations, throughout the six years of the experiment. However, this trend as well seems to diminish with time ( Fig 2D )

. One feature of the parallelism with which LTSP populations adapt is the establishment and persistence of lineages that tend to behave with similar dynamics across populations. Combined, the convergence with which adaptive mutations occur and the lineage structure of our populations enables us to identify hundreds of instances of putative historical contingencies and reveal that such contingencies are very common, affecting more than a third of convergently mutated loci.

. 001 ). An additional indication that many of the observed mutations are adaptive is the extremely high convergence with which mutations within non-mutator clones occur. ~88. 5% of mutations acquired by non-mutator clones, fall within 265 loci that are mutated in at least two independently evolving populations ( S1A Fig and S4 Table ). These 265 loci constitute only ~5. 7% of the E. coli genome

. Here we expand on our previously available data by sequencing clones sampled up to six years into our experiment. Utilizing these data, we characterize the lineage structure of each of our five LTSP populations. We show that the lineage structure of LTSP populations is itself a convergent feature of LTSP adaptation. This lineage structure, together with the extreme convergence of adaptation under LTSP enables us to search for putative instances of historical contingency ( Fig 1 )

. Data from the sequencing of ~10 clones per population, from each of nine sampled time points, spanning the first three years of the experiment ( for a total of 413 sequenced clones ), have enabled us to begin characterizing the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP [28]. These analyses have revealed that during the studied time frame, LTSP populations continuously and rapidly adapt through the continuous accumulation of mutations

. It is thus possible that the extremely high levels of convergent adaptation we observed constitute an underestimate of the true extent of convergent adaptation under LTSP. To conclude, we demonstrate that LTSP populations adapt in an extremely parallel manner, with a majority of mutations occurring within non-mutator clones falling within loci that are mutated across multiple populations

. The identified lineage structure of our LTSP populations and the high convergence with which mutations are acquired across independently evolving lineages allowed us to identify hundreds of loci pairs for which the acquisition of mutations is statistically significantly associated. Our results demonstrate that contingency is remarkably common, as more than a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one putative contingency. Our approach has a number of limitations

. Combined, these results show that our LTSP populations continuously adapt in an extremely convergent manner, up to at least six years under resource exhaustion, with a possible moderate reduction with time in the fraction of mutations subjected to positive selection. One of the most striking examples of convergence that we already reported on in our previous publications involves mutations in the RNA-polymerase core enzyme ( RNAPC ) -encoding genes rpoB and rpoC [27, 28]

. Thus, it can be said that when it comes to the clones carrying a cytR + deoR mutation combination, the cells that replicated and rose to high frequencies at a given time point, were not descendants of those that replicated and rose to high frequencies during a previous time point. Other laboratories have also carried out LTSP evolutionary experiments on E. coli, which varied in their experimental design and in their duration [33, 56, 57]

. Yet, such convergence is particularly prevalent in our LTSP experiments, where almost 90% of the mutations that occur within non-mutators fall within loci that are mutated across multiple populations and lineages. In addition, we also frequently observed the occurrence of precisely the same mutations across independently evolving lineages and populations. Such specific convergent mutations are less frequently observed in evolutionary experiments [20, 54, 55]

. Despite this apparent reduction with time, adaptation is still highly convergent even six years into our experiments—even at the last time point sampled, 84% of mutations occurring within non-mutators fall within loci that are mutated across at least two populations

. In this paper, the term ‘contingency’ will be used to describe mutations whose adaptive nature is significantly dependent on the previous acquisition of other adaptive mutations. One well-characterized example of historical contingency was revealed as part of Richard Lenski’s seminal long-term evolutionary experiment ( LTEE ) [7, 8]. The LTEE was initiated in 1988, when 12 independent populations of E. coli were established in glucose-limited growth media, supplemented with citrate

. Specifically, the ability of E. coli to adapt to utilize citrate as a carbon source required a large number of mutations to occur in a fairly specific order, with the effect of certain mutations depending on the previous occurrence of others [8, 11–14]. Fitting with the instance of contingency identified in the LTEE, historical contingency is often framed as a factor that reduces the predictability of adaptive trajectories [3, 15, 16]

. We found that lineages are established under LTSP and persist for prolonged periods of time ( Fig 3B ), while continuously accumulating mutations ( S2 Fig ). Such a lineage dynamic indicates that the cells that constitute the majority of the replicating sub-population continuously belong to the same lineages. In other words, it demonstrates that most cells that are able to replicate at a given time point are decedents of those that were able to replicate at previous time points

Our five LTSP populations, established in July 2015 maintain their viability to this day. Fig 2A depicts viability as a function of time, as estimated by plating samples and quantifying colony forming units ( CFUs ). We previously sequenced 413 clones from 9 time points spanning the first three years of our LTSP experiments. Here, we add to these data, resulting in whole genome sequencing data of 637 clones sampled at 12 time points, spanning the first 6 years of the experiment

. The different LTSP experiments carried out by other groups vary from ours not only by growth volume, but also by additional parameters such as vessel type, the growth media and the precise E. coli strain used [33, 56, 57]. It is thus difficult to make direct comparisons between our results and those of other LTSP experiments. However, we can say that our results are consistent with those of other LT experiments in showing that E. coli adapts under LTSP via convergent accumulation of mutations [27, 28,29,32,34,35,36,37,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84,86,88,90,92,94,96,98,100,102,104,106,108,110,112,114,116,118,122,126,130,134,138,142,146,150,154,158,162,166,170,174,178,182,186,190,194,198,202,206,210,214,218,222,226,230,234,238,242,246,250,254,258,262,270,274,278,286,290,294,298,302,306,310,318,326,334,342,350,358,366,374,382,390,398,406,414,422,438,446,454,462,478,494,510,526,550,586,610,646,686,746,786,826,866,946,1010,1066,1066,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106,106

    Title: 
    Abstract: Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA, the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not. Here, we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. 

    Supporting Text:
    Previously, we described the generation of a Drosophila line that inserts the mCherry coding sequence into exon 3 of the iab-8 ncRNA within the Drosophila bithorax complex [3]. Although RT-PCR performed on embryonic RNA extracts confirmed that the mCherry sequence was properly spliced into the mature iab-8 RNA, fluorescence was never observed in the CNS where the iab-8 transcript is normally expressed. However, an mCherry signal was detected in the male accessory glands [3]

. As its name suggests, MSA is a male-specific transcript that was found in libraries made from Drosophila male abdomen. Later, it was found that this transcript is specifically expressed in a particular cell type of the seminal fluid producing, male accessory gland ( AG ), called the secondary cells ( SCs ) [3]. MSA shares all but its first exon with the iab8 lncRNA ( See Fig 1 ). As such, it also acts as a template to create the same miRNA as the iab-8 lncRNA ( miR-iab-8 )

. Here, we investigate the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript. Using GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture cells and transgenic constructs in living flies, we show that the presence of upstream ATG sequences ( or upstream open reading frames—uORFs ) in the 5’ exons of iab-8 prevent downstream translation from the iab-8 transcript

. The longer of these two transcripts is called the iab-8 lncRNA and is expressed in the posterior central nervous system ( CNS ) [1, 4]. Loss of the iab-8 ncRNA leads to male and female sterility, largely due to the loss of a miRNA located within its intronic sequences [1] [5, 6]. A slightly shorter, second version of this transcript also exists, called male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) [2]

. We recently showed that the msa transcript codes for a micropeptide ( MSAmiP ) that mediates sperm usage in mated females [7]. Thus, we hypothesized that the lack of mCherry signal could be indicative of a mechanism to prevent MSAmiP from being expressed in the posterior CNS from the iab-8 transcript. The main difference between the msa and iab-8 transcripts lies in the first exons

. The position of its promoter within the iab-8 region of the Drosophila bithorax complex allows it to be expressed in the posterior of the embryo where it can restrict posterior expression of more-anterior hox genes. We have previously noted that its placement just upstream of one of its primary target genes may be indicative of an ancestral repressive mechanism to silence abd-A, requiring its presence upstream of its target gene [23]

. Given the conservation of these uORFs in Drosophila, it is interesting to note that we can find no overt phenotypic effect on the development or behavior of the fly, when we ectopically express the MSA version of the transcript. We explore the possibility that this repressive mechanism may be a remnant of an ancient method to prevent ectopic activation of the abd-A homeotic gene.

. The exceptional redundancy of this repression mechanism led us to question why such a mechanism might exist in the iab-8 transcript. Our first hypothesis was that repression of MSAmiP in the CNS might be important for the viability of the fly. Although we cannot strictly rule out unseen oddities in these flies, thus far, we have not discovered an overt deleterious effect from the ubiquitous expression of the MSAmiP-producing msa transcript, in either male or female flies

. Interestingly, this problem is avoided by simply having upstream open reading frames in the transcript to inhibit potential downstream translation initiation. In other words, using coding genes to inhibit transcription of downstream genes would avoid this problem. While we believe that the uORFs in the iab-8 transcript might be used to prevent the creation of spurious ABD-A protein, this does preclude the coded peptides from having a biological function in their own right

. Previously, our genetic dissection of the iab-8 ncRNA has indicated that the primary function of the iab-8 transcript is the production of the iab-8 miRNA [4, 23]. This miRNA is important for repressing the translation of many target genes, including abd-A, Ubx and their essential cofactors homothorax and extradenticle [1] [5] [6] [32] [4]

. Using ribosome immunoprecipitation and GFP knock-ins, we showed that the MSA transcript serves as a template for a small peptide that we call MSAmiP. Through deletion and frameshift mutations, we found that MSAmiP plays a role in regulating sperm usage in fertilized females. Interestingly, although the iab-8 transcript shares the sORF coding for MSAmiP, using GFP fusions we were never able to detect this peptide in the CNS, where iab-8 is expressed

. This means that upstream sites of translation initiation will be found by scanning ribosomes before downstream sites. Ribosome profiling studies have shown that there are over 35, 000 translated but largely unannotated uORFs present in the ~13500 annotated genes of Drosophila melanogaster [27]. Because transcripts with uORFs are markedly less expressed than genes without uORFs, it seems that the presence of uORFs has a negative impact on downstream translation initiation [17]

. Thus, it may be the concentration of rare codons that might be the mechanism by which this uORF prevents downstream translation. Based on our results, there seem to be conserved ORFs in the iab-8 RNA that prevent downstream translation. This conservation suggests that either these ORFs code for important peptides or that the prevention of downstream translation is important for the functioning of the organism

. Unfortunately, we were not able to convincingly quantify this derepression for statistical analysis due to the variability in the staining procedure that resulted in changing background levels ( S3 Fig ). However, these results suggest that the primary purpose for the upstream ORFs in Drosophila melanogaster might be to repress unwanted ABD-A expression that might occasionally result from miss-splicing of the iab-8 ncRNA.

. With the large number of transcripts containing uORFs, the importance of this area of gene regulation seems vastly under-studied by the scientific community. Here, we show that uORFs present in the first two exons of the iab-8 transcript reduce translation initiation from downstream ORFs. Past studies where uORFs impact the level of translation of downstream ORFs has made a mechanistic distinction between overlapping and non-overlapping uORFs

. Thus, while we cannot rule out more subtle effects or roles in other species for these ORFs, our results do not support a role for these peptides in the development or functioning of the fly. A third alternative reason for developing such a repressive mechanism would be to inhibit the translation of a protein aside from MSAmiP. Previously, we showed that the iab-8 lncRNA produces many alternatively spliced products

. We have previously shown that the loss of this miRNA in the AG leads to both the abnormal development of the secondary cells and an abnormal post-mating response in females after mating [3]. Although both of these RNAs were originally classified as non-coding and have essential non-coding functionalities, we recently discovered that the MSA version of the transcript is actually protein coding [7]

Within the cis-regulatory region controlling the expression of the two, most-posterior homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster ( abd-A and Abd-B ), two transcripts have been identified that differ only at their 5’ ends [1–3]. Both transcripts are spliced and polyadenylated but are expressed in different tissues. Originally both of these transcripts were categorized as non-coding

. MSA starts from a promoter downstream of the iab-8 promoter and results in the first two exons of iab-8 being replaced by an alternative first exon. We tested the translation potential of these two transcripts by placing the coding sequence of GFP as an in-frame fusion to the MSAmiP sequence in the context of the full length MSA or iab-8 cDNAs, and transfecting these constructs into tissue culture cells and flies. We found that GFP signal was never detected in cells transfected with the i-8 cDNA but was detected in cells transfected with the MSA cDNA. This suggests that the presence of the two upstream ORFs in the first exons of iab-8 prevent translation of MSi from the i-8 transcript.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ). CDG typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body. This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes. Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG. Here, we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets.

   . Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders typically characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays [4, 5]. However, because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms of CDG can affect most organ systems. Loss-of-function mutations in 189 glycosylation genes lead to CDG [6]

. These time and effort-intensive methods can only be applied to one disorder at a time. The different CDG are likely connected because they all affect protein glycosylation and show similar symptoms in patients [66]. Because of their relatedness, it is probable that common modifiers affect multiple CDG. Here, we leveraged evolutionary tools to analyze all glycosylation genes and identify potential modifiers for all CDG genes

. High ERC between N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis could also suggest unexplored connections between these pathways, and they may need to be studied together instead of in isolation. High ERC scores occur when two proteins are under similar evolutionary constraints [19, 60]

. 50 ) [31]. GPAA1, a member of the GPI transamidase complex [13], had high ERC with ALG1, a mannosyltransferase in N-linked glycosylation ( ERC = 9. 29 ) [11]. All seven glycosylation proteins in these top-scoring pairs are associated with their own CDG, further suggesting that known CDG genes are likely candidates for genetic modifiers of other CDG [14–16, 20]. Top scores in our dataset revealed high ERC between PIGB and UTP20 ( ERC = 10. 33 ) and PIGN and WDR36 ( ERC = 9. 74 )

. Glycosylation is highly conserved from yeast to mammals allowing for strong evolutionary signals to have developed over time [11, 56, 57]. Previously identified modifier genes for CDG have high ERC values, including PMM2 –PGM1 ( 7. 08 ) and DPAGT1 –DPM1 ( 4. 17 ) [14, 16]. In vivo testing of top hits from our analysis had a hit rate ( 10 out of 16 ) higher than previously found in other ERC studies ( 5/16 and 12/34, respectively ) [41, 42]

. ERC allows us to identify proteins with evolutionary rates that covary with CDG proteins, potentially identifying genetic modifiers. A number of recent studies suggest that other glycosylation genes modify CDG genes. In 2002, a study examined a small group of PMM2-CDG patients, the most common CDG, and identified a variant in ALG6, an N-linked glycosylation gene, segregating with more severe outcomes [20]

. Patients with the same CDG and even the same disease-causing variant can show phenotypic variability, indicating that genetic background and environment can influence clinical presentation [7, 8]. Current treatment options for CDG are limited, primarily focusing on symptom management [9, 10]. Identifying genetic modifiers of glycosylation genes could lead to new therapeutic targets for CDG patients

. We calculated ERC scores for proteins in the N-linked glycosylation pathway across the genome and ran the same analysis as we did for GPI anchor synthesis. We took the top 1% of values and determined the number of scores for each N-linked glycosylation protein and compared this to the expected distribution, as we did above ( S9 Fig ). Among the eight cytoplasmic proteins, three were under-represented, and four were over-represented

. Using ERC to identify disease modifiers is a novel application that could be applied to help better understand and treat rare diseases. On average, glycosylation protein pairs showed high ERC regardless of whether the two proteins were in the same pathway. However, we found exceptionally high ERC scores between proteins involved in GPI anchor synthesis and N-linked glycosylation. One hypothesis for this might be both pathways’ shared reliance on mannose

. Applying a computational evolutionary method allows for more rapid and broad detection of disease modifiers. Identifying genetic modifiers of CDG will lead to a better understanding of the physiology underlying variable symptoms in patients and could point to new therapeutic targets. Using ERC, we performed an analysis to discover proteins that have correlated evolutionary rates with glycosylation proteins to discover genetic modifiers of CDG

. To determine if each of the individual glycosylation pathways exhibited even higher ERC than when all glycosylation proteins are considered, we analyzed pairwise ERC of proteins in each major glycosylation pathway ( GPI anchor synthesis, N-linked glycosylation, and O-linked glycosylation ) as well as proteins that contribute to multiple glycosylation pathways ( Other ) ( Table 1 ). As before, permutation testing was used to determine the significance of the ERC values

. A modifier screen and ERC analysis of NGLY1, a deglycosylating enzyme associated with a CDG, identified multiple glycosylation genes showing high ERC with NGLY1, implicating them as potential modifiers [15]. A CRISPR screen in cells with reduced DPAGT1 function, the first step in N-glycan synthesis, identified multiple glycosylation genes able to rescue glycosylation defects caused by inhibition of DPAGT1 [14]

. We found strong intra-pathway ERC signatures among glycosylation proteins in each of the three glycosylation pathways, with the highest average score in GPI anchor synthesis. There were also high inter-pathway ERC values between proteins in different glycosylation pathways. Strikingly, GPI anchor synthesis proteins had many high ERC values with N-linked glycosylation proteins. Protein complexes and proteins with similar functions in glycosylation were also enriched for strong ERC

. We examined the N-linked glycosylation pathway to determine if lower ERC scores for cytoplasmic enzymes were unique to GPI anchor synthesis or common in glycosylation pathways. The N-linked glycosylation pathway is similar in that the first few steps occur on the cytoplasmic side, and the glycan is completed and attached to a protein on the ER lumen side

. In yet another study, a yeast model of PMM2-CDG was evolved over 1000 generations to identify genetic changes that increased the viability of the PMM2 mutant yeast strains [16]. Several top genes that accumulated compensatory mutations were also involved in glycosylation. These studies indicate that genetic variation in glycosylation genes might potentially modify the outcomes of CDG

. Proteins in all three glycosylation pathways showed strong ERC with proteins in different pathways ( Table 2, and, S5 and S6 Figs ). As within the pathway, GPI anchor synthesis had the highest scores with other glycosylation pathways. The average ERC score between proteins in GPI anchor synthesis and proteins in N-linked glycosylation is 0. 81 ( p < 1x10-5 ), O-linked glycosylation is 0. 46 ( p < 0. 014 ), and Other is 0. 61 ( p < 1. 30−4 )

. To identify potential proteins that could modify multiple CDG genes across the pathway, we also ran GO analysis on proteins that had a significant ERC score with at least a third ( 10 or more ) of the 30 GPI anchor synthesis proteins ( Fig 6 and S2 Data ). Unsurprisingly, GO analysis again showed high enrichment for glycosylation proteins ( GPI anchor biosynthetic process GO:0006506, fold enrichment 18. 53, q = 1

. Because the GPI anchor synthesis pathway had the highest average ERC score of all glycosylation pathways ( GPI mean ERC = 1. 61 ), we focused the genome-wide analyses on the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. We included the 27 proteins specific to the GPI anchor synthesis pathway and DPM1, DPM2, and DPM3. DPM2 is a component of the GlcNAc-transferase complex in GPI anchor synthesis and the dolichol-phosphate-mannose ( DPM) transferase DPM1 and D2 are involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI anchor. DPM3 is involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI anchor. DPM is involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI. DPM is involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI. DPM is involved in the transfer of mann to the GPI. DPM is involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI. DPM is involved in the transfer of mannose to the GPI.PM is involved in the transfer mannose to the GPI.PM is involved in the transfer of mannose to GPI.PM is involved in the transfer mannose to GPI.PM is involved in the transfer mannose to GPIPM is involved in the transfer mannose to GPIPM is involved in the mannose to GPIPM is in the transfer mannose toPM is involved in the mannose toPM is in the mannose toPM is the mann toPM is the mannPM is the mannPM the mann is thePM the mann thePM the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann the mann

    Title: 
    Abstract: The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation, which remains to be determined. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ). Therefore, HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation, but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Through this specific domain, HBV Pol recruits a host phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 for the enclosing of pgRNA in mature capsids. Our investigation of this molecular event elucidates the mechanism underlying the HBc phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade during pgRNA encapsidation into nucleocapsids.

. These results indicated a transition from phosphorylated to dephosphorylated Ser170 in HBc at the RNA encapsidation stage, consistent with a previous publication [22], suggesting that the dephosphorylation of HBc at Ser170 might play an important role in the complete packaging of HBV pgRNA. The dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 coincided with the encapsidation of RNA, suggesting that the viral Pol protein may act as a carrier for this putative phosphatase ( Fig 3A )

. The correlation between HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation and the intricate RNA packaging process suggests a role for Pol in facilitating HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation during pgRNA encapsidation. In line with this, we demonstrated that Pol recruits the phosphatase PP1 to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170, which is dependent on pgRNA through the epsilon RNA signal, even in the absence of HBc. Thus, our study elegantly elucidates the sequence of events in pgRNA packaging

. At the same time, phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 ( and/or HBc-Ser162 ) also plays a key role in the recruitment of Pol-pgRNA complex, which acts to nucleate capsid assembly and is critical for accumulating the first few subunits of the growing capsid as well as the formation of an incomplete RNA-filled capsids [47, 48]

. However, the hyperphosphorylated HBc-CTD carries a negative charge, which may also reduce subsequent pgRNA packaging, leading to incomplete RNA encapsidation [18]. Based on our observations, Pol-pgRNA in incomplete capsids may initiate dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 through Val782-mediated PP1 recruitment. This dephosphorylation event restores the positive charge of the HBc ARD and promotes nucleocapsid maturation and compaction ( the enclosure step )

. It is possible that the phosphorylation of the HBc CTD is involved in the initial stage of pgRNA encapsidation, but the subsequent dephosphorylation of HBc is required for the enclosing of pgRNA into the mature capsid in the late stage of encapsidation. A putative phosphatase associated with the Pol-pgRNA complex has been proposed to perform this function

. As documented, dimeric HBc and empty capsids exhibit hyperphosphorylated HBc, whereas nucleocapsids containing RNA or DNA exhibit hypophosphorylated HBc [21, 22]. Among the seven putative phosphorylation sites identified in the CTD, Ser155, Ser162, and Ser170 are considered major phosphorylation sites [23, 24]. Substitution of Ser162 or Ser170 with Ala significantly impaired viral pgRNA packaging [20, 25]

. To examine the effect of HBc dephosphorylation by PP1 on pgRNA packaging, we introduced the YMHA or YMHD mutation into the Pol-V782Y mutant replicon to arrest HBV replication at the stage when pgRNA-containing capsids accumulate. The results showed that HBc-Ser170 remained highly phosphorylated in both replicons, but the amount of RNA packaged within the capsids was markedly reduced ( Fig 6A, lanes 2, 3 vs. lane 1 )

. Although our study has clarified the role of Pol-dependent HBc dephosphorylation in the formation of mature HBV nucleocapsids, it is worth noting that previous studies using HBc non-phosphorylatable ( Ser to Ala ) mutants have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser residues at 162 and 170 of HBc is required for the packaging of pgRNA. [20, 44], in contrast with our findings

. To address these questions, we generated an antibody ( Ab ) capable of distinguishing the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of HBc at Ser170, which allowed us to monitor the phosphorylation pattern of HBc-Ser170 during the progressive stages of pgRNA packaging. Interestingly, we discovered that a unique domain of Pol is involved in the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170

. Moreover, Phos-tag analysis showed that whereas only phosphorylated HBc was present in Pc-Pol- expressing cells, complementation of WT-Pol but not Pol-V782Y resulted in dephosphorylation of HBc in Pc-Pol- expressing cells ( Fig 4C, lanes 7–8 vs. 9–10 ). In addition, we found that hyperphosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 in the Pol-V782Y replicon was associated with a significant reduction in pgRNA content in the capsids ( Fig 4B, lane 5 )

. Therefore, Pol could have dual functions in the RNA encapsidation process: the binding of pgRNA to the HBc dimer/multimer intermediate ( nucleation ) [30, 32, 41] and the recruitment of PP1 to dephosphorylate HBc for complete compaction of the nucleocapsid ( enclosure ). Consistently, recent cryo-EM studies have revealed discernible interior structural differences between the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the HBc CTD with pgRNA

. These findings suggested that Pol may play a role in the transition of the HBc phosphorylation status from hyperphosphorylated to hypophosphorylated during the completion of pgRNA packaging. To further investigate the mechanism of Pol-mediated HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation, we identified the domain in Pol that is responsible for its dephosphorylation function

. The results showed no difference in binding to the 3. 5 kb pgRNA between WT and mutant Pol for Northern blotting and qRT-PCR ( Fig 6F and 6G ). These results provide evidence supporting the crucial role of Pol and a specific residue ( Pol-Val782 ) in regulating HBc dephosphorylation and RNA enclosure into complete capsids during HBV replication via the recruitment of the phosphatase PP1.

. In summary, our findings highlight the role of Pol-mediated PP1 recruitment and subsequent HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation in promoting RNA encapsidation and compaction of the nucleocapsid. Inhibition of host PP1 may hinder viral capsid assembly, and this strategy can be combined with current CpAMs to enhance potency

. Importantly, our study focused primarily on the later stages of pgRNA encapsidation, and future research should explore the potential specific functions of HBc phosphorylation in the early stages of encapsidation and their relationship with phase separation. The rationale for designing Pol-V782Y in this study is based on the Pol-V747Y mutation used by Dr. Marion’s team in the DHBV study [33]

. Furthermore, unlike that in the Pc- replicon, HBc-Ser170 in the Pc- Pol-V782Y replicon failed to undergo dephosphorylation ( Fig 6D, lane 4 ), and the amount of encapsidated DNA in both capsids and virions was significantly reduced ( Fig 6, lanes 4, 5 vs lanes 1, 2 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacterial symbionts, with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ), play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean, offering a “natural experiment” for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. However, the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked. We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus, to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. It highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.

   . This unique relationship allows for a comparative study of symbiont adaptation, free from the confounding effects of host evolutionary history. We used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to recover metagenome-assembled genomes ( MAGs ) of bacterial symbionts associated with Codakia and Ctena sister species from both sides of the Isthmus of Panama

. We compared the metabolic potential of the symbionts from either side of the Isthmus to investigate how the vastly different environmental conditions of the Caribbean Sea ( CAR ) and TEP have shaped the evolution of lucinid symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. We discovered that nitrogen fixation genes were encoded in the MAGs of all Caribbean symbionts but absent in all the MAGs of symbionts from the TEP

. To further explore the evolutionary origins of nitrogen fixation in different lucinid symbiont lineages, we compared the genomes of symbionts across the Isthmus of Panama with other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world. Using phylogenetic reconciliation, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon and identified two distinct HGT events that led to nif gene acquisition and correlated with the colonization of nutrient-poor environments

Studies on the adaptations enabling animals to cope with environmental changes resulting from the closure of the Isthmus of Panama ( reviewed in [8] ) have largely overlooked the role of host-associated microbes [1]. Our investigation focused on understanding how environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus of Panama have influenced the distribution, diversity and metabolic functions of symbionts associated with lucinid sister species separated by the closure of the Isthmus

. Filling the gaps in the lucinid symbiont phylogeny by including novel symbiont and/or free-living relative genomes may resolve the uncertainties in the ancestral state reconstruction. The genes for fixing nitrogen were ubiquitous in the genomes of Ca. T. endolucinida clades from the oligotrophic waters of the Caribbean and Hawaii but absent in the TEP and Cape Verde clades originating from upwelling regions characterized by sporadically high levels of bioavailable nitrogen [38, 45]

. Understanding the mechanisms enabling microbial symbionts to adapt to new environmental conditions will provide novel insights into how animal-microbe symbioses respond to changing environments. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama about 2. 8 million years ago had a profound impact on oceanic conditions, altering environmental factors such as ocean currents, salinity, temperature, and nutrient availability on both sides of the Isthmus [7]

. These findings indicate that both these clades have convergently acquired nitrogen fixation capabilities in an oligotrophic environment, and further suggests the horizontal transfer of nitrogen fixation genes might be a major factor enabling lucinid symbiont adaptation to nitrogen-poor conditions. The third well-supported transfer event was inferred from an ancestral node of the clade consisting of Ca. T. endolucinida CAR and HAW to Monit1

. However, the abundance of free-living “PEGO” symbionts and their close relatives has not been measured, and further investigation of the free-living microbial communities in lucinid habitats is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics. Finally, the ambiguous ancestral states of the deeper branching nodes of the other Ca. Thiodiazotropha clades hinder our interpretation of gene loss and/or reacquisition events in these symbiont lineages

. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida populations have diverged ecologically and occupy separate niches that differ in nitrogen availability. We hypothesize that the diversification of these symbionts was facilitated by the acquisition of the nitrogen fixation genes through HGT. Our results provide valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between environmental factors and genetic exchange that shape the ecology, evolution, and diversification of host-associated microorganisms.

. taylori, Ca. T. endolucinida, and Ca. T. gloverae symbiont species, together with their global distribution ranges, present an interesting opportunity to study the origins of genetically cohesive units with species-like properties and characterize the ecological factors underlying bacterial bacterial diversification. For example, further studies on Ca. T

. Recent studies have begun to unveil the metabolic and genomic diversity among symbionts from vastly different environments across the globe, including differences in their abilities to metabolize carbon and inorganic nitrogen [18–20]. Notably, some symbiont clades of the genus Ca. Thiodiazotropha were the first documented example of nitrogen-fixing chemosynthetic symbionts [21, 22]

. Our primary objective was to investigate how differing environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus have influenced the selection, diversity, and functional traits of symbionts associated with lucinid clams. We found that all lucinid symbionts from the Caribbean had the potential to fix nitrogen and assimilate nitrate, but these functions were absent in all symbionts from the TEP

. pectinatus from a region in Florida that experiences seasonal upwelling events [52–54] presents the opportunity to study how a change in access to abundant nutrient resources could drive gene loss and eventually lead to diversification of this clade. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between the environment and gene exchange that shapes the evolution and diversification of bacterial symbiont populations

. Codakia and Ctena sister species from either side of the Isthmus hosted distinct clades of symbionts from the genus Ca. Thiodiazotropha. Despite the absence of symbiont clade overlap across the Isthmus, we observed a lack of specificity between hosts and symbionts, which was evident in the incongruence of their respective phylogenetic relationships

. The Isthmus of Panama presents a unique opportunity to investigate the drivers of diversification and adaptation through a "natural experiment” running for millions of years with a taxonomically replicated set of animal-microbe assemblages [10]. This offers valuable insights into the interplay between hosts and their microbial symbionts in the context of environmental change

. In addition, horizontally acquired bacterial symbionts—those obtained from the environment in each generation—have access to a larger genetic pool for genetic exchange during their free-living phase, which can lead to faster adaptive responses [3]. Consequently, symbionts can serve as a source of ecological innovation, enabling the symbiosis to tap into novel resources and adapt to novel habitats [4–6]

. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the nifHDKT genes to gain insights into the evolution of nitrogen fixation in the lucinid symbionts and the factors underlying the sporadic distribution of this metabolic capability across the lucinid symbiont tree. While clades A and C of the nifHDKT gene tree mirrored the phylogenetic relationships of the symbionts, the incongruence of clade B with symbiont tree topology suggests the nifHDKT genes of the Ca. T

. The acquisition of nifHDKT genes by Ca. T. endolucinida from a Sedimenticola lineage, rather than one of the Ca. Thiodazotropha is unexpected, given that transfers are more likely within the same clade as gene flow tends to occur more frequently among genetically similar bacteria [42]. A possible explanation for this could be the higher abundance of Sedimenticola OTUs in sediment bacterial communities [43] compared to Ca. Thiazropha OTUs, making it more likely for Sedicola genes to be transferred to Ca. T. enducida.

    Title: 
    Abstract: TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention, leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors. However, the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored. Here, we identify 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content, in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters; compared to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics.

   . Each taste is generally associated with a suite of related receptors [2]. Bitterness, as perceived by humans, is detected by a family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) called TAS2Rs or T2Rs, encoded by compact, intronless genes. Previous studies have shown that vertebrates have a wide repertoire of TAS2Rs, which varies considerably across lineages, from zero in cetaceans to over two hundred in frogs [3–5]

. 1-33 MY. Overall, the varying levels of turnover across different gene lineages of the TAS2R family suggest multiple different mechanisms are driving the evolution of the bitter taste receptor repertoire in vertebrates. The phylogenetic relationships and genomic location of these genes suggest that recombination may play an important role in creating variation in the TAS2R gene repertoire through changes in both copy number and gene conversion

. Indeed, the number of expressed receptors that are not found in the tongue is directly proportional to the number of TAS2Rs in the genome. This suggests that increases in TAS2R number may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions in specific genes ( i. e., gene subfunctionalization ). The receptors we chose for follow-up functional characterization illustrate the potential importance of extra-oral TAS2Rs in amphibians

Our unified gene mining workflow across over 600 vertebrates indicates that in frogs and salamanders ( batrachians ) the TAS2Rs gene family experienced a rapid expansion, leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than any other lineage of vertebrates examined to date

. To explore TAS2R functions in amphibians, we quantified their expression levels across a variety of ecologically and phylogenetically diverse amphibian species. Inspired by the extra-oral receptor studies that have been performed in humans, mice, fish, and chickens [31, 33–36], we performed transcriptome analysis of seven different tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first search for extra-oral TAS2R expression in amphibians

. However, most non-anuran amphibians ( salamanders and caecilians ) are generalist predators throughout their life [39], and amphibians interact with bitter compounds in a variety of ecological contexts beyond aversive taste, suggesting that trophic differences across life stages are not the only factor influencing the evolution and diversification of the TAS2R family

. Despite evidence that amphibians have an incredible diversity of TAS2Rs, with current literature values ranging from 3 or 4 in Gaboon caecilians ( Geotrypetes seraphini ) to almost 250 in Japanese wrinkled frogs ( Glandirana rugosa ) [4, 5, 27], the full scope and underlying mechanisms of the massive expansion of TAS2R genes in amphibians, and the sensory and ecological functions of these receptors remain largely unknown

. In this study, we performed genome-wide comparative analyses of 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 high-quality vertebrate genomes in order to gain insights into the unique evolutionary trajectories and dynamics of the TAS2R gene family in amphibians. We then evaluated functional aspects of TAS2R expansion in amphibians through gene expression analyses of seven tissues across five amphibian species spanning broad evolutionary and ecological diversity

. Since the sequences of receptors in both studies are identical and the reported responses are only moderate, this result may be due to differences in the assay systems. These cellular assays indicate the functional potentials of selected TAS2Rs expressed either in oral or non-oral tissues to detect not only the bitter compounds known as other vertebrate species but also the substances relevant to amphibian ecology.

The advent of advanced sequencing technologies and the surge in high-quality genome sequences throughout the animal kingdom in recent years have opened new avenues for taxonomically broad genome mining for diverse gene families, such as TAS2Rs. We developed a computational pipeline to identify bitter taste receptors in any unannotated genome, and used it to analyze chromosome-level assemblies from 661 vertebrate species, identifying 9, 291 intact TAS2Rs

. We constructed a phylogenetic gene tree by maximum-likelihood containing the 9, 291 TAS2Rs found in our chosen species ( Fig 1D ). We noticed that TAS2Rs diverged extensively after the major vertebrate lineages were established. Most amphibian receptors are found in four major groups ( clade M1-M4 ). Several receptors form small groups in the gene tree ( clade m1- m4 )

. In contrast, many other amphibians seem to have developed extra-oral specific receptors. Indeed, the expanded TAS2R repertoire of these species correlates with non-orally expressed receptors. Finally, we find that phylogenetically similar receptors often have similar patterns of expression, both between paralogs within species-specific radiations and across orthologs between species

. To characterize the function of a vast number of TAS2Rs in amphibians, we assessed the tissue-specific expression patterns of TAS2R genes in four frogs and one salamander species ( Fig 4A ) : the cane toad ( Rhinella marina ), the golden poison-dart frog ( Phyllobates terribilis ), the American bullfrog ( Ra. catesbaiana ), the tropical clawed frog ( X. tropicalis ), and the axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum )

. We selected receptors to represent the broad range of amphibian TAS2Rs, exemplifying different patterns of copy number evolution and gene expression as shown in S1 Data. We tested 18 chosen amphibian receptors against a panel of 28 substances ( S4 Table ). The panel includes 6 natural products potentially relevant to amphibian ecology and 22 classic bitterants with diverse chemical structures

. We focused on post-metamorphic tissues since the only life stages study performed so far found similar ligand receptivity profiles between tadpoles and adult frogs [3]. For all amphibians, more than half of TAS2R repertoire were detected in any of seven tissue transcriptomes ( Fig 4C ). In most amphibians, the tongue has the greatest diversity of TAS2Rs, but only a fraction of the TAS2Rs in the genome were expressed ( Fig 4D )

. 95 > aBayes > 0. 90 ). We do find that bird and reptile ( Sauropsida ) receptors are relatively distributed, with some grouping with amphibians and others with mammals. To gain a general view of the evolutionary dynamics of TAS2R gene content in vertebrates, we reconstructed ancestral TAS2R family sizes across our focal species’ phylogeny using DupliPHY [46]. Our reconstruction revealed a rapid increase in the number of receptors along the branch ancestral to all batrachians ( i. e

. Overall, our detailed gene cluster analysis across vertebrates suggests that the frequent formation and expansion of TAS2R clusters due to their local genomic environments may be a major driver of the large and lineage-specific TAS2Rs repertoires in amphibians. Conversely, around 7–27% of genes experience lower rates of duplication ( i. e., CNCOs )

. Concordantly, Hao et al. found distinct TAS2R expression profiles in the mouth tissue of tadpole and adult American bullfrogs ( Rana catesbeiana, also known as Lithobates catesbeianus or Aquarana catesbeiana ), and showed that many of these receptors are capable of responding to classic human bitterants [3]

. Considering the prominent and important extra-oral functions of TAS2Rs, we suggest that amphibian TAS2Rs be considered as “specialized chemosensory receptors, ” to emphasize their broad range of proposed functions beyond conscious oral taste.

. Concordantly, among species where we found TAS2R gene clusters, both the number of clusters and average genes per cluster showed strong positive associations with TAS2R count across vertebrates ( pgls; number of clusters: β = 1. 1, t = 50. 7 p <2e-16; avg. genes per cluster: β = 0. 88, t = 51. 04 p <2e-16; full model adj. r2 = 0. 92 ), as well as within frogs and salamanders ( pgls; number of clusters: β = 1. 2, t 3. 5 p <e-4; avg genes per cluster: β = 0.9, 3 t 3. 4 p <e-4; full adj. r = 0 0 9 9 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: A tri-protein complex containing NICD, RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation, confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro, and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity. To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells.

   . To test the assumption that HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes we used the broad acting HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could block the intestinal consequences of NDD as well as gamma secretase inhibitor treatment ( DBZ or DAPT ) in mice and spheroids, respectively, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells.

. To identify changes in dimer vs monomer Notch interactome we performed TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29. The constitutively active TurboID-fused Notch2 and its Notch2RA counterpart constructs expressed at similar levels and biotinylated the NTC and other known partners

. To conclude, Notch dimerization in mammals seem to be less about transcriptional regulation of an enhancer subset to which they bind through SPS, and more about the overall proteome environment with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions underlying the hypersensitivity of NDD mice. HDAC3 interacts with NICD1, regulating its stability and activity [67]

. Consistently, Notch activation expends the stem cell niche at the expense of goblet and enteroendocrine cells [24]. Notch dimerization-deficient ( NDD ) mice show an environmentally modulated susceptibility to DSS and a decrease in colonic stem cells [14], but the mechanism linking Notch dimerization with the stem cell niche remains unknown. In this study we used our NDD mouse model to further investigate the role of NTC dimerization in intestinal and colonic stem cells

In a previous study we reported that N1RA/RA; N2RA/RA ( NDD ) mice loose colonic stem cells when challenged with 1% DSS, a dose that is well tolerated by wild type controls [14]. To test if loss of Notch dimerization affects colonic stem cells via a cell-autonomous mechanism, we established colon spheroid cultures devoid of immune system components and passaged them in vitro

. Moreover, spheroids form NDD mice show enrichment for genes associated with host defense against symbionts and interferon-ß targets, consistent with an elevated colonic epithelium innate immunity response in the absence of immune cells or symbionts; none of these transcripts is known to be a direct Notch target

. Mechanistically, our null hypothesis was that monomers-supported activities of NICD will remain unchanged in NDD mice, but dimer-dependent transcription will be affected. Unexpectedly, RNAseq data from colonic spheroids did not identify differential expression of dimer-dependent targets, recording instead overall reduction in Notch-supported function such as proliferation and barrier function ( Fig 5 and S1 Table )

. The transcriptome analyses suggested a reduction in adhesion, increased spheroid differentiation, and elevated innate immune apparatus in spheroids, but failed to provide mechanistic insight linking Notch dimerization to these responses. To investigate the hypothesis that dimerization is involved in modulating Notch dimer-dependent protein-protein interactions, we performed TurboID analysis [32, 33]

. As we noted above, NDD mice do not display the full spectrum of Notch LOF intestinal phenotype, specifically, we do not see evidence of goblet expansion ( seen even in animals with Notch1 LOF, [26] Fig 3L ). Although HDAC3 is a known interactor with co-repressor complex that binds RBPj in absence of NICD1 [47–50], our attention shifted to the HDAC2 cluster. The HDAC2 cluster was significantly less affected by the RA substitution compared to the other clusters

. To test if stem cell function diminished with age, we collected tissue from mice of 300 days of age or older. H&E staining and immunofluorescence imaging of colon sections showed normal histology and numbers of proliferating Ki67+ cells in N1RA/RA, N2RA/RA and N1+/–; N2+/–mice ( S4A-C and S4A’-C’ Fig ). Together, these results demonstrate that Notch dimerization-deficient intestinal stem cells can maintain homeostasis when unchallenged but are sensitized to exogenous challenges

. We quantified cell numbers instead of spheroid count in passage 1 and 2 to illustrate the deficiency of self-renewal in colonic stem cells lacking a full complement of dimerization-competent Notch receptors ( Fig 1E ). Consistently, baseline in vivo Lgr5 expression is reduced in the distal colon of NDD mice compared to controls and was further reduced after treatment with 1% DSS ( S1A Fig )

NDD mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced stripping of the mucosa and develop colitis when challenged with 1% DSS [14]. In this study we analyzed some of the mechanistic underpinning of this intestinal phenotype. We show that dimerization-deficiency mimics a subset of Notch loss of function ( LOF ) phenotypes in the small intestine, namely, reduction of stem cells and increase in Paneth cells ( Figs 2–4 ) [21] but no goblet cell metaplasia ( S2 Fig, [22, 23, 25–27] )

. If HDAC2 activity contributes to the reduction in Notch activity seen in NDD mice, HDAC2 inhibition should ameliorate the NDD phenotypes. To differentiate between these possibilities, NDD mice were treated with Valproic acid ( VPA, 200mg/kg/day ), an HDAC2 inhibitor [41] approved by the FDA for use in humans [42]. Interestingly, VPA ameliorated the ISC ( OLFM4+ ), and Paneth cell ( Lysozyme ) phenotypes found in NDD mice at baseline ( Fig 7A )

. To test the hypothesis that the NDD mutants are a mild loss of function allele, we compared the small intestine in NDD and wild type mice in which Notch signaling was removed or inhibited. Loss of Notch signaling by inhibition ( with DBZ ) or with N1 and N2 neutralizing antibodies leads to loss of stem cells and enhanced differentiation towards secretory cell lineages [21]

. Accelerated Paneth cell differentiation without Atoh1 upregulation is another hallmark of a weak loss of function Notch allele, perhaps acting as sentinels for reduced Notch activity in stem cells. To assess the susceptibility of mice with single dimerization deficient Notch to DSS-induced colitis, we subjected N1RA/RA; N2+/+, N1+/+; N2RA/RA, and NDD mice as well as wild type controls to two 10-day cycles of 1% DSS treatment, with a 14-day normal drinking water recovery phase

. Notably, Notch2RA labeling of endogenous human NOTCH2 was significantly reduced relative to control, as expected in the absence of dimerization. Qualitatively, the interactome was unchanged; on average, however, quantitative analysis revealed a 33%-39% labeling reduction across all interacting partners, consistent with weak ( hypomorphic ) activity of N2RA. Interestingly, the HDAC2-anchored interactome was significantly less affected by loss of dimerization

. The expression of another progenitor cell marker, Prom1, in control and NDD mice was indistinguishable ( S3A Fig ), as was Sox9 staining in jejunum and colon ( S3B and S3C Fig ). Likewise, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling leads to elevated Atoh1 expression, Atoh1 levels in the NDD jejunum and ileum remained indistinguishable from controls ( Fig 3C ), indicating sufficient Notch activity

. We first established stable HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cell line overexpressing truncated human NOTCH2ΔE-TurboID, NOTCH2ΔERA-Turbo, and NOT2-TurID, and NOT2RA-Tur. TurboID was used to biotinylate NTC and other interactors. The interactome of NOT2-TurID and NOT2-Tur was similar to that of NOT2EurID and NOT2Eur, respectively, while that of NOT2RAID and NOTRA was significantly reduced compared to NOT2urID and NOT2ur ( Fig 1A ). The interactome of NOT2urID and NOT2ur was similar to that of NOT2EID and NOTE, while that of NOT2RA and NOT was significantly reduced compared to NOTur and NOT ( Fig 1 ). The interactome of NOT2ID and NOT2 was similar to that of NOT2 and NOT, while that of NOTRA and was significantly reduced to NOT ( Fig 1 ). The interactome of NOT2 and NOT was similar to that of NOT2 and NOT, while that ofRA was reduced to NOT ( Fig 1 ). The interactome of NOT and NOT was similar that of NOT and NOT, while of was reduced to NOT ( Fig 1 ). The interact of NOT and NOT was similar to of NOT and NOT while was reduced to ( Fig 1 ) The interact of and NOT was to of NOT while NOT was reduced ( Fig 1 ) The interact of NOT was to NOT of while was reduced ( Fig 1 The interact of was NOT to NOT while was reduced ( Fig 1 The interact was to NOT while was ( Fig The interact to was NOT was ( Fig The to was NOT was ( The was to was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was The was

    Title: 
    Abstract: Background selection, by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, influences patterns of total neutral diversity, πT, and genetic differentiation, FST, in structured populations. The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another, leading to selective interference. Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST, but this has not been fully explained. Here, we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. Moreover, we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans.

   . Here, we have extended quantitative genetic models of background selection [11, 25–26] to account for the effects of migration in an island model, showing that migration, in addition to selection and recombination, acts to end the cross-generational association between a neutral allele and linked deleterious alleles

. In cases where migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles, that is, m ≥ t, we expect deleterious alleles to emigrate from local populations at an appreciable rate prior to their removal via selection. Under this regime of non-trivial migration rates, we expect the effects of background selection on FST to be significantly attenuated, as we expect greater similarity in reductions in πS and πT

. In summary, we have provided a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model; this model accounts for the effects of migration providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of background selection by truncating cross-generational associations between neutral and deleterious alleles in their reproductive success, and presents a first step into the application of background selection theory in systems with more complex demography

. g. Ref [4] ). Then, we derive the expected FST in an island model with background selection and a finite number of demes, when migration follows genetic drift. In this section, we extend the quantitative genetic approach to modeling background selection, following the framework of Santiago and Caballero [24–26] and Buffalo and Kern [11], to account for how migration influences the effects of background selection, B, in an island model consisting of diploid individuals

. Regardless, our theoretical predictions further support the expectation of background selection weakly confounding locus-to-locus FST scans when gene flow is sufficiently common [37]. Our simulations suggest that this is true in an island model when m ≥ t ( Fig 2 inset ). In this section we highlight some general effects of background selection on genetic diversity, π, in our simulations and discuss the performance of our theoretical predictions

. We found that background selection can cause substantial reductions in πT ( Fig 3 ), despite weak effects on FST. Under our parameter sets, this effect is most pronounced for lower strengths of selection against deleterious alleles under both low and high migration parameter sets, and it is weakly influenced by the introduction of low rates of recombination. Previous work has suggested that selective interference is more common in larger populations ( reviewed by Ref

Zeng and Corcoran [36] suggested that the effects of FST in an island model would be predictable from modifying the effective size of a subpopulation, Nlocal, by multiplying times B, the Ne/N ratio created by background selection. We show here that migration lessens the effects of background selection on the amount of genetic differentiation caused by local drift relative to predictions of B based on earlier work ( e. g. Ref [4] )

. In our derivation above, we hypothesized that migration acts to reduce the effect of background selection by presenting a neutral allele the opportunity to end its association with deleterious alleles within a subpopulation, thus reducing its total variance in fitness within the focal subpopulation. We further discuss these predictions below

. Thus, migration appears to attenuate the effects of background selection by exporting deleterious alleles to different subpopulations prior to their removal via selection, resulting in similar reductions in πT and πS such that FST is not elevated. In contrast, with low migration, background selection occurs primarily within subpopulations to reduce πS, with some effect on πT [35, 37]

. e. Blocal=πlocalπ0, local, where πlocal is the geographically local estimate of diversity in a subpopulation experiencing background selection and π0, local is the neutral expectation ) under our quantitative genetic model of background selection, we must consider that neutral alleles that contribute to diversity patterns arose at different times in the past, and have therefore experienced different degrees of the effects of background selection

. Given that this additional increase in the variance of reproductive success of neutral alleles is due to selection at linked sites, this has been termed the fitness-effective population size, Nf [11]. First, we describe the framework under panmixia; then, we extend it to predict the geographically local effects of background selection in an island model, Blocal ( where Blocal = Nf, localNlocal ), by deriving its local fitness-effective population size Nf, local. [24, 45]

. In order to predict the effects of background selection on FST in an island model, we now consider the effects of background selection on the fitness-effective population size of each geographically local subpopulation, Nf, local. First, we will solve for Qi2, the linkage inflation factor. Qi2 captures the cross-generational associations between a focal neutral site and deleterious site i within a focal subpopulation

. In cases where t >> m, we expect the effect of migration to be relatively weak, as selection will likely act to remove deleterious variants prior to their emigration from a population. Under this relatively low migration regime, we expect predictions of background selection to be accurate even without consideration of the migration effect, given that migration is sufficiently infrequent. This is indeed what has been previously observed

. We find that the effects of background selection on πS and πT are dependent on the migration rate, which is to be expected given that migration influences FST both directly and through its effects on background selection, and that FST influences the effective population size of the metapopulation [27] ( see Methods Calculation of FST ). Under our low migration rate parameter set, we found that πS was reduced by a fractionally larger margin than πT ( cf

. A useful property of these models is that predictions for B may be made under weak selection, by considering that weakly deleterious alleles have an appreciable rate of fixation via genetic drift. We tested the predictions of our novel derivation using simulations and found that it best predicts FST and πT under varying strengths of selection, recombination rates, and migration rates

. Indeed, we observed an inverted U-shape curve of FST under background selection, but only for our low migration cases ( Fig 1E and 1F ), similar to the effect on overall diversity from background selection [50]. We later discuss the intermediate and high migration cases. Considering only our low migration cases, we observed that the effects of background selection on FST from weakly deleterious alleles are relatively weak ( Fig 1E and 1F, gray dots when Nlocalt ≤ 1 )

. More details may be found in the Methods. Previous work on background selection in structured populations has demonstrated that, in some cases, the effects of background selection in an island model can be approximated as a reduction in local effective population sizes proportional to the strength of background selection [34, 36]. In order to estimate and predict FST, we use the definition of Hudson et al. [30], where FST=1−πSπB

. Under weak selection and low recombination, we expect correlations in frequency to arise between segregating deleterious variation, leading to selective interference among deleterious alleles. Here, selection at a deleterious site is no longer independent of selection at nearby sites. Instead, deleterious sites themselves also experience a reduction in fitness-effective population size due to selection at linked sites

. 50, thus representing populations with very high genetic differentiation and low gene flow. Hereafter, we consider deleterious alleles with Nlocalt ≤ 1 to be weakly deleterious, 1 < Nlocalt < 7. 5 to be moderately deleterious, and Nlocalt ≥ 7. 5 to be strongly deleterious. Given previous work on the theory of background selection in structured populations [36], we expected the greatest increase in FST due to background selection at moderate strengths of selection

. Our work provides a mechanistic understanding of the effects of background selection on genetic diversity and differentiation in structured populations, and suggests that background selection may confound locus-to-locus FST scans when gene flow is sufficiently common. We also show that background selection may cause substantial reductions in π, particularly in metapopulations with larger effective size.
Researchers have developed a federated genetic testing tool, FedGAT, to perform association studies while correcting for confounding and polygenic effects among collaborating sites without sharing genetic data. FedAT uses a federated statistical approach and homomorphic encryption to protect intermediate statistics. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves results similar to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. However, federated studies have challenges, such as designing harmonized data collection and covariates, may lead sites to perform meta-analyses sharing summary statistics, reducing computational burden and privacy concerns. Previous research focused on secure GWAS, adopting feder methods like χ2 test, PCA, and logistic regression, but lacked correcting polygenic effects due to complexity. FedAT integrates random effects in different designs without algorithm changes, an advantage from efficient testing GAT formulation. FedAT uses two-step testing and homomorphic encryption to protect statistics aggregated in feder setting, increasing data sharing and protection. Despite regulations like HIPAA, sharing raw data is restricted, FedAT provides unbiased results with large sample sizes and diverse populations. FedAT and Chen-Edalli's method have different advantages, contributing to the literature. Zhu et al developed a federated generalized mixed model for GWAS, one of the first to perform mixed testing. Privacy concerns hinder high-powered GW studies, requiring large samples, leading to data siloed and underutilization due to concerns. Regulations like HIPAA and GDPR protect health records, including genetic data. FedAT modularizes the problem in stages, enabling tiered privacy design for GW.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk, including prostate cancer, by combining multiple genetic variants into a single score. However, these models have not been formally assessed for their performance in prostate cancer, particularly in diverse populations. This study benchmarked six widely used PRS algorithms, four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts, and found modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants and clumping. The findings underscore the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. 

PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening may reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with PSA alone. However, given ancestry-associated PC incidence and outcome biases, it is crucial that scores work equally across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluated performance of published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort, finding no differences in cancer or risk factors such as year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol. Publicly poly risk scores were evaluated in the dataset, trained on allelic scoring of risk and first 10 genetic components with cross-validation, regardless of population. Predictive models improved with integration of age and poly score, similar to findings in UKob, addition of family and BMI did not increase power. The utility of scores from UKob dataset shows genetic coupled with age sufficient to predict cancer. 

The study evaluated poly scores in clinical utility, fitting a model with top PRs, age, assessment, PC history, and BMI, which improved prostate prediction in population manner. The addition of age significantly increased AUROC of PR-only model. Given diversity in incidence and outcome across ancestry, poorly risk tools may compromise stratification and care, particularly those likely afflicted. The work highlights need for algorithms to predict across populations and sampling diverse cohorts.

    Title: 
    Abstract: DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies. It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1, 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model. Notably from this screen, we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms, and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG.

   . The compound eye makes up a large portion of the Drosophila head, but this knockdown is likely even lower because our RNAi is eye-specific. In vitro analysis of DPAGT1-CDG patient proteins found they had 10–50% protein activity [35]. Thus, having at most ~35% of normal DPAGT1 expression is a reasonable amount of knockdown to model DPAGT1 deficiency. This knockdown results in a small, improperly developed, rough eye phenotype ( hereafter referred to as “DPAGT1 model” ) [28] ( Fig 1 )

. Thus, a drug repurposing screen in Drosophila for DPAGT1-CDG could help find new potential therapeutics for this disorder. In this study, we performed a drug repurposing screen on a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG to identify new therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1. We identified 42 compounds that suppress the DPAGT1-CDG model and genetically confirmed many of the drug interactions

. In this study, we screened 1, 520 small molecules and identified multiple drugs that improved a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG. We verify these findings using pharmacologic and genetic manipulation which strongly align with the known mechanisms of these therapeutic hits. We establish new biological connections between DPAGT1 and DA signaling, NKCC1, and prostaglandin synthesis

Here, we identify multiple drugs that improve a Drosophila model of DPAGT1 deficiency. Overall, 8/21 ( 38% ) drugs tested from the primary screen validated in further dose-response analysis. In addition, 6/16 ( 38% ) drugs derived from the primary screen improved the DPAGT1 model. Almost all tested drugs were genetically validated by manipulating their target genes in Drosophila

. Given the opposite downstream effect of these receptors compared to Dop2R, we hypothesized that they would have an opposite effect on eye size. We crossed heterozygous null mutations of Dop1R1 [53] and Dop1R2 [52] into the DPAGT1 model. Supporting our hypothesis, DPAGT1 model flies carrying a heterozygous null Dop1R1 mutation had worse eyes than the DPAGT1 model alone ( Fig 3H and S3 Table )

To model DPAGT1-CDG, we used an eye-based Drosophila model that we previously established [28]. The Drosophila eye is regularly used to study and model biological processes, including development [29–32]. In our model, DPAGT1 expression is reduced in the eye by RNA interference ( RNAi, UAS-GAL4 system [33], eya composite-GAL4 driver [34] ). Analysis of whole fly heads of the DPAGT1 model resulted in a ~65% knockdown of DPAGT1 expression ( S1A Fig )

. Loss of Dop2R does partially rescue the DPAGT1 model [Dop1R1+/-] eye size, but to a lesser extent than loss of Dop2R on its own ( Fig 3I, p<0. 0001, Student’s t test, Dop2R RNAi compared across experiments ). This result is in line with the opposing effects of Dop1R1 and Dop2R on downstream cAMP signaling ( Fig 3A ). The fourth DA receptor in Drosophila, DopEcR, has no clear human ortholog

. Alternatively, they can potentially be used in an off-label capacity at a clinician’s discretion [3–5]. Even if a repurposed screen does not immediately result in a new therapy, it can still identify new biological interactions that can increase our understanding of a disorder. DPAGT1-CDG is a rare disease that results from autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme DPAGT1. It is one of nearly 200 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDGs ) [6–9]

. Our data suggest that manipulating DA signaling is a promising therapy for DPAGT1-CDG and implicates a larger role of DA signaling on N-glycosylation. The compounds and pathways identified in this screen are potential new therapeutic and genetic interactions with DPAGT1 that may represent new treatment options for DPAGT1-CDG.

. Dop2R is the only Drosophila ortholog of human genes D2R, D3R, and D4R. These encode for "D2-like" G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that inhibit the adenylate cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway [44, 45] ( Fig 3A ). Matching the pharmacological data from the primary screen, reduced expression of Dop2R using RNAi resulted in a strong improvement of eye size across all RNAi lines and replicates tested ( Fig 3D and 3E and S3 Table ), compared to other tested drug and RNAi treatments

. Given the impaired eye development in the DPAGT1 model, these processes may underlie the improvement from ACE inhibition ( and the ostensible increase in acetylcholine ). While muscle weakness in patients and the eye defect in the DPAGT1 model are distinct phenotypes, they are connected because both are improved by decreasing breakdown of acetylcholine. It is possible that impaired acetylcholine signaling may occur outside of muscles in DPAGT1-CDG patients

. These 42 compounds include acetylcholine-related drugs, dopaminergic antagonists, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors, among others. Importantly, we find that both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor can partially rescue our DPAGT1 model. In addition, impairing dopamine ( DA ) synthesis or recycling can also partially rescue the model

. For example, patients also have impaired neurodevelopment as well as eye disorders such as cataracts [20, 92]. Further use of AChE inhibitors may be worth exploring further in patients given the improvement in eye development in our model. Overall, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have beneficial effects under DPAGT1 impairment in flies and humans. We found that inhibiting Dop2R signaling improves the DPAGT1 model

. Matching the primary screen, bumetanide caused a strong increase in eye size in the DPAGT1 model in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 6A ). Ncc69 is the Drosophila ortholog of NKCC1 and NKCC2 [66, 67]. Genetic knockdown of Ncc69 also resulted in an increase in eye size in the DPAGT1 model ( Fig 6B and S3 Table ). This corroborates with the bumetanide data that inhibiting NKCC1/NKCC2 activity is beneficial under DPAGT1 deficiency

. Drosophila share ~75% of human disease-causing genes [21] and have been regularly used in drug screens [22–24]. Drug repurposing screens in Drosophila have had previous success in identifying new potential therapies for CDGs. For example, our laboratory identified GSK3β inhibitors as a potential treatment for NGLY1 deficiency [25]. In addition, a drug repurposing screen in C. elegans identified the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat for treating PMM2-CDG [26, 27]

. This could underlie the benefits in the DPAGT1 model from Dop2R genetic and pharmacological inhibition. Supporting this hypothesis, heterozygous knockout of the Dop1R1 receptor worsened the DPAGT1 model. Binding to Dop1R1 may counteract signaling to Dop2R through increased cAMP signaling. Given this, drug classes such as D2R antagonists or D1R agonists might be good therapeutics for DPAGT1-CDG

. DPAGT1 synthesizes dolichol-PP-GlcNAc in the first step of N-glycosylation. DPAG1CD is caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding DP1. DPAG1CD is one of nearly 200 Congital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDs) [6–9]. DPAG1 is the first enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway. DP1CD is caused by autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene DP1. DP1 is the first enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway. DP1CD is caused by autosomal recessive loss-function mutations in the gene DP1. DP1 is the enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway DP1CD caused by autosomal recessive loss-function in the gene DP1 DP1 is the enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway DP1 caused by autosomal recessive loss-function in the gene DP1 DP1 is the enzyme in the N-glycosylation DP1 caused by autosomal recessive loss-function in the gene DP1 DP1 is the enzyme in N-gly DP1 caused by autosomal recessive loss-function in the DP1 DP1 is the enzyme in N-gly DP1 caused autosomal recessive loss-function in the DP1 DP1 is the enzyme DP-gly DP1 caused autosomal recessive loss-function in DP1 DP is the DP-gly DP1 autosomal recessive loss-function DP1 DP is DP-gly DP autosomal recessive DP1 DP-g DP autosomal DP DP-g DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP DP
Researchers developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA) to model the representation of proprioception in the somatosensory cortex. The model was trained on natural human movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey studies: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates and the distribution of preferred directions (PD) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model predicts that encoding across the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs and few neurons encode a single joint. The model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and the basis for neural manifolds with applications to restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of robots. 

The model learns to translate proprio inputs into a latent representation of proprioception read as neural firing. It has minimal bias regarding particular sensory modality and can generalise to other regions of cortex. Proprioceptive areas are critical for goal-directed behaviour but the principles of proprio cortical coding are unclear. The model relates kinematics to proprio encoding and compares to single-unit recordings from monkeys. A novel model predicts neural coding and organisation across cortex. The topoVA model is a deep network that learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs to cortical latent space of spiking neurons embodying a stochastic generative model of movement-related activity. It hypothesises the cortex learns through experience an efficient representation of the somensory world. 

The model makes predictions about the nature of proprio coding one of which is partially validated with limited data. Future work includes identifying constraints to reproduce neural data from proprio cortex. The model finds structure akin to pinwheels of the visual cortex representing movement instead of orientation selectivity. Proprio representations are characterised at two levels: spatial curves of individual neurons and organisation of tuning maps across cortical surface. The model combines proprio stimuli with novel organisation of neurons in somensory cortex to develop understanding of proprio coding.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress. The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants. However, only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants. AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. Our data suggests a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Although ethylene receptors and signal transduction have been well-studied in plants, they have not been extensively studied in non-plant species [24, 25, 27]. Here, we show that AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene and the application of ethylene regulates A. brasilense physiology including reducing biofilm formation and root colonization

. This prompted us to examine the biological role of ethylene as a signal in this species and study how ethylene perception by the bacterium affects various traits including root colonization. Our research demonstrated that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Our data suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants affects the pattern and density of colonization by A. brasilense

. Direct evidence for saturable ethylene binding to a specific receptor in microbes affecting physiology has only been obtained in Synechocystis and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis [32, 45]. A plant-associated bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, contains a gene encoding a putative ethylene receptor [32]. We call this gene Azospirillum ethylene response1 ( Azoetr1 ) following the nomenclature used in plants

. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that putative ethylene receptors are found in other bacterial phyla, including many non-pathogenic proteobacteria that associate with plants [27, 32, 41]. This suggests that ethylene may be perceived by these bacteria to mediate their interactions with plant hosts. Most published studies examining the role of ethylene in plant-microbe associations have focused on microbe-induced changes in ethylene levels or signaling in plants [16, 42–44]

. These results demonstrate that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects bacterial traits involved in stress resistance and host colonization, the first to be described in a proteobacterium. Ethylene inhibits biofilm formation resulting in reduced cell aggregation. There are many sources of ethylene in soil including plants and bacteria [20]. To determine whether A. brasilense Sp7 uses ethylene as a signal to communicate with other A

. Thus, the bacterial ethylene receptors may have roles in addition to mediating responses to ethylene or there may be feedback mechanisms on the receptors that reduce responses to ethylene as observed in plants [24, 25]. Lower nitrogen availability increases AzoEtr1 transcript abundance which would decrease ethylene sensitivity. AzoEtr1 contains a putative binding site for the sigma-54 factor RpoN which might mediate this response to nitrogen

. Manipulating ethylene signaling or synthesis in plants or the application of ethylene can affect plant health as well as the population of microbes associated with the plant [12–18]. Ethylene was first discovered to be a phytohormone over 100 years ago and was the first identified gaseous, biological signaling molecule [19]. In plants, it controls and modulates many developmental and physiological processes and responses to various environmental cues and stressors [20]

. Almost all research on ethylene as a signaling molecule has focused on its role as a plant hormone and the signal transduction pathway by which it is perceived by plants [24–26]. However, responses to ethylene are not limited to plants, and have been reported in bacteria, fungi, slime molds, marine sponges, and even human cell lines [27]

. Ethylene levels in the soil can reach sufficiently high concentrations to elicit responses in plants and it is clear that bacteria modulate ethylene responses in plants [21, 44]. This coupled with the presence of an ethylene receptor in A. brasilense led us to hypothesize that root-derived ethylene affects the recruitment of specific rhizosphere bacteria to the root surface

. Thus, A. brasilense does not produce ethylene under the conditions tested. Ethylene could act as a cross-kingdom signal from plants to A. brasilense as EPS production and biofilm formation are important for colonization of plant roots by A. brasilense [57, 58]. This led us to question whether ethylene and AzoEtr1 affect root colonization. To evaluate the influence of ethylene on the ability of bacterial cells to colonize roots, we used ethylene insensitive 2-5 ( ein2-5 ) A

. Additionally, the application of ethylene causes wide-spread changes in metabolism that appear to upregulate carbon metabolism and downregulate nitrogen metabolism. Nitrogen metabolism and nutrient availability, including the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, regulate cell-to-cell aggregation, root attachment, and biofilm formation in A. brasilense [84–87]. These data indicate that the perception of ethylene by soil and rhizosphere bacteria, such as A

. At this point, the signaling pathway linking AzoEtr1 to these responses is unknown and it is unclear which of these or combination of these changes are central to responses to ethylene. Characterizing the signal transduction target ( s ) of AzoEtr1 should help decipher among these possibilities. The advantages of perceiving ethylene in the rhizosphere are not yet clear. Unlike plants and some bacteria, our results indicated that A

. Ethylene levels in the soil are influenced by various factors, including compaction and water saturation and can range from trace amounts to above 10 ppm, which is well above the levels needed to elicit biological responses in plants [20–23]. Our results suggest several possible ecophysiological roles for ethylene in A. brasilense. One major source of ethylene in the soil are plant roots, raising the possibility that plant-derived ethylene regulates root colonization by A. brasilense

. brasilense with plants is not restricted to cereals since they have been reported in many plant species across botanical families [46] including Solanum lycopersicum ( tomato ) and Arabidopsis thaliana [47, 48]. Inoculation of plants with A. brasilense alters the expression of genes in the plant related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling [47, 49–51]. However, nothing is known about the responses of A. brasilense to ethylene and the role of the putative ethylene receptor protein

. brasilense. Because other plant-associated bacteria are predicted to contain ethylene receptors [27, 32, 41], this could represent a mechanism applicable to other bacteria.

. The levels of Azoetr1 and Azorretr1 transcripts were not significantly altered by ethylene treatment in the RNA-seq dataset. qPCR of these genes revealed only a small transient change in Azoetr1 and no change in Azorretr1 caused by the application of ethylene ( S12 Fig ). RNA-seq analyses predicted that ethylene treatment elicited major metabolic changes in the bacteria

. brasilense. In this role it might be regulating the timing, spatial distribution, or both of colonization of the root surface. Ethylene does not seem to cause cells to leave a biofilm, but can prevent additional cells from becoming part of a biofilm. Colonization of plant roots can lead to increased ethylene biosynthesis by the plant [16, 43, 107]. Thus, another role of plant-derived ethylene may be to act as a cue for A

. However, these roles are not mutually exclusive. Many soil proteobacteria that form associations with plants also contain putative ethylene receptors [27, 32, 41] suggesting that ethylene acts as a gaseous signal that affects colonization by many species of bacteria.

. In A. brasilense, we predict that signaling from AzoEtr1 involves his autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to AzoRREtr1, and, based on studies of other receptors we predict that ethylene inhibits AzoEtr1 his autophosphorylation. Deleting the single ethylene receptor isoform in either A. brasilense or Synechocystis resulted in more extreme phenotypes than the application of ethylene

. Unlike in plants, signaling from SynEtr1 relies on histidine kinase activity and phosphorelay to a response regulator protein [32, 36]. In this species, ethylene causes various molecular and physiological changes including changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. In this study, we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target, H2A. Z. Instead, in the absence of INO80, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes. These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema.

   . However, it is unclear whether the chromatin remodeler INO80 plays any role in the meiotic silencing of the sex chromosomes. Here, we explore the role of INO80 in silencing meiotic sex chromosomes. We show that INO80 interacts with and regulates sex-linked gene silencing in pachytene spermatocytes. Further, INO80 promotes the opening of the sex chromatin during the zygonema-to-pachynema transition at the DSB regions

. We showed that INO80 regulates sex chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Chromatin accessibility is a central regulator of DNA damage repair response. Less accessible DNA hinders successful and efficient DNA repair [46, 47]. Chromatin accessibility is also essential in transcription factor recruitment and efficient transcription regulation at the promoter-proximal areas [48]

. Z in different cell types [22, 23, 31, 45]. INO80 also regulates somatic gene silencing at the autosomes in spermatocytes by promoting H3K27me3 modification at promoters, while H3K4me3 remains unaffected [31]. However, INO80-dependent silencing of sex-linked genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of INO80-mediated direct transcriptional regulation by enabling DNA binding factor recruitment at the promoter-proximal areas

In this study, we demonstrated a unique role for INO80 in silencing sex-linked genes during pachynema in spermatocytes. INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DSB regions of the sex chromosomes. This regulation is independent of the histone variant H2A. Z, a major INO80 effector. We also demonstrated that INO80 interacts with DSBR factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema

. We also found that INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1 in meiotic spermatocytes. γH2A. X recruitment at DSB sites during zygonema remained intact in Ino80cKO spermatocytes [18]. We propose that the initial deposition of γH2A. X at the synapse axis of sex chromosomes initiates INO80-facilitated recruitment of MDC1. This recruitment amplifies γH2A. X in chromatin loops in an INO80-facilitated ATR-dependent fashion

Immunofluorescence localization of INO80 in pachytene spermatocytes revealed staining on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) for INO80 ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] also showed binding on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1C ). INO80 binding occurred at the zygotene and pachytene stages ( GEO Dataset GSE190590 ) [32] on both autosomes and sex chromosomes

. This corroborates the observation of an incomplete MSCI in pachytene Ino80cKO spermatocytes. Several other studies also reported similar characteristics that described roles for MSCI-regulating factors [6, 38–40]. Several studies have described a regulatory role for INO80 in DNA damage response in somatic cells and meiosis [18, 41, 42]. The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex interacts with DNA damage factors such as γH2A. X and MEC1 ( ATR ) at DSB repair sites in yeast [43, 44]

. Consistent with transcriptional silencing, immunofluorescence analysis of the active form of RNA polymerase II ( pSer2 ) revealed its absence at the sex chromosomes in Ino80WT pachytene spermatocytes ( Fig 2D–2E ). These data correlate with normal transcriptional silencing. In contrast, continued RNA polymerase II ( pSer2 ) immunofluorescence in Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete silencing of the sex-linked genes ( Fig 2F–2G )

. Moreover, INO80 and γH2A. X binding in the sex chromosomes were correlated ( S1B Fig ), where INO80 binding is enriched at the γH2A. X binding sites ( S1C Fig ). These data suggested a possible role of INO80 in DSB repair and silencing the expression of genes on the sex chromosomes

. To determine how these DA sites were correlated to the change in transcription activity at the sex chromosomes, comparison of the nearest genes from the DA sites to the RNAseq data suggested significant enrichment of these sex-linked genes among the upregulated genes in Ino80cKO ( FDR <0. 05 ) ( Fig 7E ). These data indicate that INO80 plays a vital role in regulating the increased chromatin accessibility on the sex chromosome during meiotic progression

. Further, recent studies have reported a mechanistic view of the role of INO80 in sliding hexasomes and nucleosomes with different affinities to create accessible DNA [49, 50]. It is unclear whether hexasomes facilitate INO80-interaction at the meiotic sex chromosomes. However, it is logical to predict INO80 as a central regulator of sex-linked gene silencing by regulating this de novo accessibility generation, as most of these peaks are lost in Ino80cKO spermatocytes

. Utilizing this small window of time, we observed a lack of downregulation of sex-linked differentially expressed genes in Ino80cKO spermatocytes, which was also replicated by comparing homogeneous pachynema populations upon synchronization of spermatogenesis. We also validated this overall aberrant sex-linked transcription program in individual Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes by immunolocalizing active RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes

. In addition, a moderate reduction in the overall γH2A. X signal at the sex chromosomes occurred in Ino80cKO spermatocytes, suggesting a perturbed amplification of γH2A. X ( Fig 6J ). INO80 is capable of histone exchange, most notably removing H2A. Z from chromatin [23, 24]. To determine how INO80 changes chromatin dynamics on the sex chromosomes and whether its regulation of sex-linked genes is H2A. Z-dependent, we compared H2A

. The increase is more prevalent on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 7A ). To determine the role of INO80 in regulating the transition in chromatin accessibility during meiotic progression, we compared the accessible sites in P18 spermatocytes from either Ino80WT or Ino80cKO spermatocytes ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31]. We observed a minimal change in accessible chromatin at the autosomes

. These data indicate an essential role for INO80 in recruiting DNA damage repair factors to sex chromosome DSBs by regulating chromatin accessibility.

. An earlier report showed that male germ cell-specific deletion of Ino80 results in a meiotic arrest phenotype in 8-week-old murine testes. A significant population of pachytene spermatocytes display defects in synapsis and DNA damage response, leading to the loss of spermatocytes in adult testes [18]. However, during the first wave of spermatogenesis in juvenile mice, no significant cell death was observed in Ino80cKO testis up to P21

. 05 ) occurred at the same stages in Ino80cKO spermatocytes ( Fig 4D–4F and 4G ). These results indicate that INO80 facilitates the localization of MDC1 at sex chromosome DSBs during pachynema [23]. To determine whether INO80 physically recruits DSB repair factors, we performed co-immunoprecipitation for INO80 from P21 spermatocytes

. There are four major families of chromatin remodeling complexes, all of which play critical functions in murine spermatogenesis [14–20]. INO80 is the main ATPase subunit of the IN80-chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in DNA repair and transcription in murine spermatocytes. The IN80-chatin remodeling complex has been shown to interact with DNA damage factors such as γ2. X and M1 ( ATR ) at DSB sites in yeast [43, 44]. IN80 also regulates somatic gene silencing at autosomes in spermat by promoting H3K27me3 at promoters while H3K4 remains unaffected [31. However, IN80-dependent silencing of sex-linked genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of IN80 direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor binding at promoter-prox areas

In this study, we demonstrated a unique role for IN80 in silencing sex-linked genes during pachema in spermat. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB regions sex chromosomes. This is independent of histone variant H2 Z, a major IN80 effector. We also showed IN80 interacts DSBR ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment sex chromosomes during pachema. We found IN80 interacts DNA factors ATR and M1 meiotic spermat γ2 X at D sites zyema remained In80KO spermat [18 ] We propose initial deposition γ2 X synapse sex chromosomes initiates IN80-facilitated MDC recruitment.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development. It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Here, we attempted to identify the factor in regulating the functional conversion of SVH-1 during axon regeneration. We have genetically identified several genes ( svh ) involved in the JNK signaling pathway that regulates axon regeneration [5], including the svh-17/cdd-2 gene encoding cytidine deaminase ( CDD )

. In this study, we investigated the relationship between cdd-2 and svh-1 in the regulation of axon regeneration, and show that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor.

. elegans [8, 9]. The pathway is activated by a signaling cascade involving the mammalian HGF-like growth factor, SVH-1, and its receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ), SVH-2 [5]. Thus, SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling is essential for neuronal regeneration but not for neuronal development. SVH-1 contains a Kringle domain, an N-terminal domain related to a plasminogen activation peptide, and a serine protease domain [5, 10]

. Therefore, SVH-1 has a dual-function: it acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development ( Fig 1A; [10] ). However, it is unclear how SVH-1 can function as a growth factor despite having an intact catalytic triad. Therefore, there must be a switch mechanism that converts SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor to function in axon regeneration ( Fig 1B )

. elegans ( Fig 2A; [14] ). However, in cdd-1 ( ok390 ) mutants ( S1B Fig ), axons regenerated normally after axon injury ( Fig 2C and S1 Table ), suggesting that CDD-2 plays a specific role in axon regeneration after laser axotomy. Since our RNAi screen for svh genes was originally designed to identify components that function in the JNK pathway [5], we investigated where CDD-2 functions in this pathway

. SVH-1, similar to plasminogen, has an intact catalytic triad. However, its protease activity is not required for SVH-1 to activate SVH-2, as with c-Met-mediated HGF signaling [5]. Furthermore, SVH-1 regulates larval growth in a protease activity-dependent manner, independent of SVH-2 [10]. The svh-1 gene is the only C. elegans gene encoding a protein of the HGF/plasminogen family

. This expression pattern is consistent with RT-PCR analysis results, which showed higher cdd-2 expression in adult mRNA [14], suggesting that during the L4–young adult stages, CDD-2 converts SVH-1 into a growth factor that is required for axon regeneration

. The Ser-898 residue is located within the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad ( Fig 4A ) and is essential for protease activity. However, the function of SVH-1 ( S898F ) in axon regeneration still depends on CDD-2, suggesting that the His-755 residue determines whether SVH-1 acts as a protease or a growth factor. Therefore, SVH-1 in the form of His-755 cannot activate SVH-2, and His-755 must be converted to a tyrosine for SVH-1 to be active as a growth factor

. SVH-1 has two functions: protease activity for larval development at the L1 stage and a growth factor for axon regeneration at the L4 to adult stages ( Fig 6A; [10] ). Since SVH-1 functions in ADL neurons and its protease activity is required for larval development, inactivation of SVH-1 protease activity by CDD-2 should not work at the L1 stage. Therefore, the cdd-2 gene is expected to be expressed specifically in ADL neurons at the L4 to adult stages

. These protein domains are also present in mammalian HGF and plasminogen, suggesting that SVH-1 is a member of the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-2 is homologous to c-Met, a mammalian HGF RTK [5]. The sequence homology of SVH-1 to HGF and SVH-2 to c-Met suggests that SVH-1–SVH-2 functions as a ligand–receptor pair in axon regeneration ( Fig 1A ). In mammals, HGF acts as a growth factor for c-Met and induces the activation of complex intracellular signaling pathways [11]

. However, in contrast to this scenario, the protease-active and growth factor-active isoforms of SVH-1 act in the same cell ( ADL neuron ) to regulate larval development during the L1 stage and axon regeneration during the L4–adult stages, respectively [5, 10]. Therefore, CDD-2-mediated inactivation of the SVH-1 protease activity should not occur during the L1 stage; cdd-2 is only expressed at a later, distinct developmental stage

. We found that the svh-1 ( s-mut, H755Y ) mutation was able to rescue the axon regeneration defect in svh-1 ( ok2531 ) but not the larval developmental defect ( Fig 5B and 5C, and S1 Table ), suggesting that the stem-loop structure of svh-1 mRNA is required for the replacement of the His-755 ( CAU ) codon with a tyrosine ( UAU ) codon

. To test the importance of the stem-loop structure for SVH-1 function, we introduced mutations in svh-1, svh-1 ( s-mut ), which disrupt the stem structure ( 6 out of 9 bp ) but do not alter the resulting amino acid sequence ( Fig 5A ). The svh-1 deletion mutation ok2531 was used to evaluate the effects of svh-1 ( s-mut ) on axon regeneration and larval development

. Similarly, in svh-1 mRNA, the His-755 encoding CAU codon is within a stem-loop secondary structure. Our genetic analysis suggests that the stem-loop structure of svh-1 mRNA is required for SVH-1 function in axon regeneration. We propose that this secondary structural component of svh-1 mRNA is recognized by CDD-2. APOBEC-1 has general AU-binding activity [22], and CDD-2 also possesses RNA-binding activity with an affinity for AU-rich RNA templates [14]

. Previously, we have demonstrated that SVH-2 c-Met-like RTK, which is activated by the SVH-1 HGF-like growth factor, mediates the activation of the JNK cascade in axon regeneration ( Fig 3A; [5] ). We examined the relationship between CDD-2 and the SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling pathway

In this study, we demonstrate that CDD-2 converts the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. Our genetic results suggest that CDD-2 deaminates the C of svh-1 mRNA to U, replacing His-755 ( CAU ) with tyrosine ( UAU ) in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad, producing a protease-inactive and growth factor-active SVH-1. Thus, the Tyr-755 form of SVH-1 loses protease activity but gains the ability to act as a growth factor. There are two possible explanations for these results

. Thus, cdd-2 expression at a specific developmental stage is essential for the functional conversion of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor during axon regeneration. Forced cdd-2 expression at the L1 stage does not lead to the editing of svh-1 mRNA, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of CDD-2 may be activated by axon injury. The cytidine editing activity of C-2 is required for axon regeneration, but not for larval development, as cdd1 (390 ) mutants have normal axons after axotomy ( Fig 2 and S1 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state, serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and the effect of drugs. The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems. In a few cases, the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles, or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins. Usually, however, while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors, it typically cannot be changed at will. Here, we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish. We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. In this way, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system, changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model.

   . Here we explore the possibility of tuning the collective behaviour in a biological system by changing the characteristics of the constituents in the bottom–up manner of the colloids and de novo proteins. For this purpose, we use the zebrafish system, which has a well-established collective behaviour that can be monitored in the laboratory by tracking the individual fish [38–40] and which is amenable to genetic modification [41–44]

. The collective behaviour of zebrafish can further be compared to well established active matter models that encapsulate single fish properties [47–49], fish–fish interactions, [15, 20] as well as the interaction between fish and the environment [50, 51]. In particular, we investigated the behaviour of zebrafish carrying a homozygous deleterious mutation in the col11a2 gene ( col11a2-/- ), that is to say, both parents exhibited the same mutation

. Taken together we have shown that by modelling the swimming behaviour of zebrafish and treating them as active matter, we can reveal physiologically relevant behaviours that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton, demonstrating the utility of this approach as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviours to genetic traits and to phsyiological changes within the body.

Our work describes a quantitative study on the behavioural difference between wild–type zebrafish and the col11a2 -/- zebrafish whose col11a2 gene is knocked out ( suppressed ). The genetic modification caused defects in the vertebral column of mutants, leading to less body–bending in swimming, hence a slower reorientation process

. The compromised spinal development and bending ability are likely to prevent the mutant fish from making frequent directional changes when swimming, leading to a longer orientational relaxation time. Effectively, the col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited less “orientational noise”, if they were modelled as self–propelling agents with aligning interactions. On the group level, the reduced noise value is captured by the increased persistence length

. Genetic modification has been shown to change behavioural patterns in groups of fish [45, 46]. By studying groups of mutant zebrafish, we can investigate how changes in individuals lead to collective behaviour and explore the underlying biological mechanisms that drive these emergent phenomena

. These mutant fish exhibited abnormal skeletal development [52]. We also observed several degenerative defects in their vertebral column, including vertebral fusions and ruptures of the intervertebral discs. Therefore, we expect the mutation in col11a2 to change the zebrafish swimming dynamics compared to the wildtype

Knocking out the col11a2 gene changes the zebrafish system at the level of the individual fish, in several ways. The gene regulates the expression of the collagen, and its absence leads to defects in their vertebrae and intervertebral discs. Consequently, the mutant fish exhibit less bending during swimming compared to the wild–type fish, especially when the speed is slow

. These behavioral differences are well explained by the Vicsek model with a simple modification on the orientation updating rule [15, 40], suggesting that the col11a2 mutant zebrafish exhibits reduced behavioral noise. Such reduction can be attributed to the limited bending of their bodies, intrinsically related to their vertebral defects

. Interestingly, we found that the col11a2 mutant zebrafish exhibited limited vertebral column bending during swimming, and they took a significantly longer time to change their swim direction than wildtype. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant zebrafish exhibited a more polarised swimming pattern

. This behavioural difference of a single fish affected the group behaviour of twenty five, where the mutant fish group exhibited more ordered collective motion that correlates with their more persistent swimming style. In other words, we have tuned the behaviour of a biological system in a manner reminiscent of synthetic colloids or de novo proteins

To characterise the biological difference between the col11a2 -/- zebrafish and their corresponding wild–type controls, we performed skeletal phenotyping to identify changes associated with bone and cartilage in the vertebral column. First, we performed micro-computed tomography of adult ( 6-month-old ) zebrafish which provides a 3d reconstruction of the fish skeleton

. For biological purposes, the microscopic single–fish features are useful measurements of the phenotypic response to the genetic modification. In this study, we followed this “biological path” extensively by looking into the single–fish behaviour as well as the bone structures of the fish

. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the explicit linkage between the macroscopic phenomena ( group polarisation ) of the animal collective behaviour, and the microscopic detail of the individual animal ( spinal defects and changed swimming posture ) which we control with genetic modification. We explained such linkage with a modified Vicsek model, that the longer persistence length of the mutant fish can be mapped to a lower re–orientation noise in the model

. Collectively, regardless of the various possible effects on the collective behavior associated with the mutants, we concluded that the vertebral column abnormality is the major contributor to behavior changes leading to reduced flexibility in mutant fish, which resulted in limited bending while swimming. This characteristic difference in speed distribution for the mutant fish and the corresponding wild–type, can also be observed when the fish swim in a 3d environment

. Together, these observations characterise the structural difference of skeletons between mutant fish and wild–type, strongly supporting the biological foundation for the observed behavioral differences. To understand the impact that the vertebral column had on swimming behavior, we analysed their swimming posture by placing individual zebrafish in the quasi 2d environment and used a camera above to capture videos while they swim, as illustrated in Fig 2A and 2B

. On the other hand, we expect the knockout of the col11a2 gene to trigger a larger response in a larger group, since the discontinuous nature of the dynamical order–disorder transition [17, 28] will be blurred out in a small group, as a consequence of the finite-size effect [72]. However, performing such an experiment with a large group of mutant fish is challenging, as mutants display a relatively high mortality rate

. The consistent fit suggests our proposed model, regardless its simplicity, does capture the essence of the collective behaviour of zebrafish. We use our custom Python library to carry out the simulation of the inertial Vicsek model. To fit our experimental results, we set the inertial term ( α ) to be 0. 63, the number density ( ρ ) to be 0. 5, and the speed ( v0 ) to be 0. 1. The agents were confined by a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions

. In short, the same modified Vicsek model ( with the same value for the inertia parameter α ) fits both wild–type and col11a2 -/- zebrafish. In the context of this model, the mutants sample, on average, a different region of state space, although the distributions between the two types of fish do overlap

. The lack of col11a2 caused defects in their spines, changed their swimming postures, and resulted in slower re–orientation of individuals, hence increasing the persistent length lp of the group. The increase of lp for a group of mutant fish yields more ordered movement for the presence of the aligning interaction. Nevertheless, at the level of our analysis, these changes in behaviour can be described with the same model we used previously

The study investigates the possibility of controlling collective behavior in biological systems by modifying the characteristics of constituents at the bottom-up level. Zebraf fish were genetically modified to carry a homozygous deleterious mutation in the col11a gene, leading to defects in the vertebral column and intervertebral discs. The mutants exhibited less bending during swimming and slower reorientation compared to wild-type fish. A simple active matter model, the Vicsek model, captured the collective behavior of both wild-type and mutant zraf, with the latter modelled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. The study demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the state it occupies with a simple matter model. The results show that the vertebral abnormality is the major contributor to changes in behavior leading to reduced flexibility in mutant fish, resulting in limited bending while swimming. The difference in speed distribution between mutant and wild-type can be observed in a 3D environment. The study characterizes the structural difference between skeletons of mutant and wild-type, supporting the biological foundation for observed behavioral differences. The Vic model captures the collective behavior of both types of fish, with mutants exhibiting a different region of state space. The lack of cola caused defects in spines, changed swimming postures, and resulted in slower reorientation of individuals, increasing the persistent length of the group. The increase of lp for a group mutant yields more ordered movement for the presence of aligning interaction.
Researchers developed a hybrid model to simulate short-term in vitro capillary network formation, using the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration and morphology, and continuum to quantify biog deformation and VEG transport. The model bridged mechanical and chemical stimulation, showing good agreement between predicted topology and experimental results, with elongated cells forming networks and cobble-like aggregates. Capillary development relied on adequate biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient for endothelial cues. Cellular network formed when mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously.

The model encompassed mechanical and chemical cues for capillary formation, covering VEG mechanisms on endothelial cells. Soluble VEG induced morphological changes, and bound VEG provided oriental signals, both forming capillary networks. Results revealed necessity of soluble and bound VEG in network development. Capillary grew and maintained stability when both VEG forms worked. Canceling soluble VEG effects hindered cord connection in early stage. Increasing VEG amount increased both soluble and bound VEG concentration, playing significant effect.

The model focused on interactive parameters: cell force, biel, and VFs. Strength of cell traction regulated biel responses adhesion. Omitting soluble VEG results, network features consistent with experimental data. Initially, cells spread, biel and VEG uniform, then migrated, formed cords, and enclosed lacunae. Present model ignored VEG transport hindered by attached cells. VEG diffusion and binding rates on cell surface as free. Hampered V concentration biel surface lower regions attached cells contact medium. Elongated cells connected, lined cords, cobble aggregates. Computed distribution, biel density, and VEG concentration through formation. Strong correlation between cells, biel, and VEG, positive loop among cells, bi,el, and VEG.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance, repress, or generate novel functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-β ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Additionally, we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.

    C. elegans has five TGF-β-like ligands: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3. It is established that loss of DBL-1, one of two BMP-like ligands in C. elegans, reduces animal survival on bacterial pathogen [35–36]. In a variety of physiological contexts, heterodimers of BMP ligands are functionally required or outperform homodimers [39–42]. We therefore considered the possibility that DBL-1/BMP functions with the other BMP-like ligand, TIG-2, in the worm

. Together these results demonstrate significant roles for the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2 –in the response to pathogenic bacterial infection, although independent of each other. We next were interested in determining if the remaining TGF-β ligands–DAF-7, UNC-129, and TIG-3 –play a role in the C. elegans immune response. UNC-129 and TIG-3 are “orphan” ligands without known receptors and signaling components

. The nematode C. elegans has five TGF-β ligands and two characterized TGF-β family signaling pathways [27, 28], providing a powerful in vivo system in which to study TGF-β ligand functions in the context of an intact organism. Critically, TGF-β signaling mechanisms are conserved in this organism. Here we demonstrate that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogen

. elegans to pathogenic bacteria and fungi by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in response to pathogen exposure [35–38]. Here we demonstrate that the DBL-1 ligand is only one of four TGF-β family ligands with a significant role in the immune response to two gram-negative bacterial pathogens

. Most surprisingly, ligands that demonstrate nonredundant relationships are those from different classes of TGF-β ligands–BMP-like TIG-2 with TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3; and possibly BMP-like DBL-1 with TGF-β/Activin-like DAF-7. The two TGF-β pathways in C. elegans are known to signal through canonical mechanisms upon activation. DBL-1 signals through the BMP-like pathway with ligand binding to the single Type II receptor DAF-4 and the Type I receptor SMA-6

. DAF-7 and TIG-3 are most appropriately classified as TGF-β/Activin-like ligands, whereas DBL-1 and TIG-2 share the most similarity with BMP ligands in mammals [26, 27]. Of the five TGF-β ligands in C. elegans, only two have well-characterized signaling pathways through which they signal [27, 28]

. The reduced repertoire of ligands and receptors in invertebrate organisms provides an opportunity to study ligand-receptor functional interactions more completely. Due to the conservation of TGF-β signaling pathways, studies in the genetically tractable organisms Drosophila and C. elegans have resulted in universal insights into conserved signaling mechanisms. In C. elegans, there are five ligands associated with TGF- β signaling: DBL-1, DAF-7, TIG-2, TIG-3, and UNC-129

. UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3 have been classified ( as BMP-like or TGF-β-like ) based on their structural characteristics but have not been fully associated with all members of either the BMP-like or TGF-β-like signaling pathways in C. elegans [26, 27]. Previous work from our lab and others has demonstrated that the BMP homolog DBL-1 functions in the innate immune response of C

. Our system provides a platform for studying the functional interactions between multiple TGF-β ligands. Interaction between BMP and TGFβ/Activin subfamily members may provide a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic ligand functions from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.

. We next looked for interactions between the remaining C. elegans TGF-β ligands upon exposure to bacterial infection by testing double mutants as described above for tig-2dbl-1 ( Fig 1C ). We analyzed the tig-3;tig-2 double mutant, deficient in both BMP-like TIG-2 and TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3, for survival on P. luminescens

. However, joint action between a BMP and TGF-β/Activin ligand, including potential cross-subfamily heterodimers, has not yet been described in vertebrates to our knowledge, and warrants further consideration. Interestingly, nonredundant roles for TIG-2, TIG-3, and UNC-129 have recently been identified in neuronal guidance in C. elegans [56]. In neuronal guidance, TIG-3/UNC-129 heterodimers are implicated, with TIG-2 being released from a different tissue

TGF-β signaling is a highly conserved mechanism that plays significant roles in development in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans [1–4]. This signaling family also plays an important role in the post-developmental adult in maintaining homeostasis and repair [3, 5–7], as well as serving as one of the highly conserved signaling mechanisms involved in the immune response [8–14]

The multiplicity of TGF-β family ligands, receptors, and Smad signal transducers may support the generation of diverse context-dependent outcomes through combinatorial interactions. Biochemical and computational approaches are useful in identifying the principles mediating the potential protein-protein interactions between these components, but these approaches must be complemented by functional in vivo analyses. The nematode C

. The phenotypic similarities provide evidence that TIG-2 and TIG-3 signal through the canonical BMP signaling pathway consisting of SMA-6 Type I receptor and SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4 Smads in the context of bacterial pathogen survival. There is precedence for TGF-β/Activin ligands signaling through BMP-like signaling pathways in vertebrates

. A dbl-1p::GFP transcriptional reporter validates these results for dbl-1. Taken together, we conclude that all five of the TGF-β ligands play a role in the immune response, but not at the level of transcriptional induction. Analysis of the survival patterns of double mutant animals produced results indicating interactions between multiple TGF-β family ligands. Interestingly, the interactions between pairs of BMP-like and TGF-β/Activin-like ligands suggest interaction in a common pathway

. We also identify the canonical BMP-like pathway as required for response to P. luminescens, including the Type I receptor ( SMA-6 ), the R-Smads ( SMA-2 and SMA-3 ), and Co-Smad ( SMA-4 ). In contrast, TGF-β/Activin pathway components have minimal effects. We previously provided evidence that DBL-1, a BMP-like ligand, plays a role in the immune response to P lumcens [35–36]. Here, we show that T-2, a BMP-like ligand, also plays a role in the response to P lumens, independent of DB-1.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity. This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure, commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes. Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A, is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. Initially, we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Accordingly, upon DNA damage, NAT4 gene expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks. Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade, nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ), accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Consistently, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks, critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. Consequently, Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation, is reduced. Importantly, we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity.

   . This study expands the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR by shedding light on a novel function for Nat4 N-terminal acetyltransferase in regulating the response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that cells lacking NAT4 exhibit increased sensitivity to genotoxic DNA damage which is associated with defective DDR signaling, culminating in impaired DNA damage checkpoint activation ( Fig 7 )

. In the current study, we unveil Nat4 as a novel player in DDR, serving as a paradigm for the NAT family of enzymes. We initially show that loss of Nat4 in S. cerevisiae ( nat4Δ ) sensitizes cells to MMS-induced DNA damage leading to accumulation of DNA breaks. Further supporting the role of Nat4 in DDR, we demonstrate that its expression is induced upon DNA damage, and it is physically recruited at the DSB-flanking chromatin

. Additionally, nat4Δ has been reported to increase the sensitivity of yeast cells to different cytotoxic agents, including 3-aminotriazole, benomyl, dinitrobenzene and thiabendazole [8]. Nonetheless, Nat4 has not been previously linked to DNA damage response. In eukaryotic cells, the chromatin environment is fundamental in regulating how cells combat DNA damage, since the generation of a DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) occurs in the chromatin context

. Overall, through this work Nat4 emerges as a novel player regulating the DNA damage checkpoint signaling, mediating its function through its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity on histone H4.

. Lastly, H4S1A mutant cells displayed increased DSB resection at sites 0. 15 and 4. 8kb from the HO-cut site ( S4C Fig ), similar to cells lacking Nat4 ( S4A Fig ) or cells expressing a catalytically inactive Nat4 ( S4B Fig ). To validate that Nat4’s function in response to DNA damage is mediated through its activity towards the N-terminus of histone H4, we investigated the phosphorylation levels of H2AS129 and Rad53 in the combination mutant H4S1Anat4Δ

. Downstream the DDR signaling cascade, Mec1 has two direct targets, including serine 129 phosphorylation on histone H2A ( H2AS129ph ) and the checkpoint control protein Rad9 [23–25]. In yeast, H2AS129ph is the first DNA-damage induced modification to arise in the vicinity of the break, also known as γΗ2A, and spreads over 50kb on both sides flanking the DSB [26, 27] stabilizing checkpoint factors and inhibiting further DNA end resection [28–30]

. As a result, downstream activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in nat4-deleted cells is defective, as indicated by reduced Rad53 phosphorylation. Notably, Nat4 acetyltransferase activity targeting histone H4 is crucial for its DDR function and checkpoint dynamics as evidenced by the deregulated DDR signaling in cells bearing a catalytically inactive Nat4 or expressing the non-acetylated H4S1A histone mutant

. Our findings highlight the essential role of Nat4 N-terminal activity towards histone H4 for optimal recruitment of Mec1 at an HO-induced DSB ( Figs 3D, 4C and 6D ). This does not exclude the potential involvement of other unidentified histone modifications in this process. Nevertheless, studies in yeast have shown that post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) on proteins play a significant role in enhancing the recruitment of Mec1 to damaged chromatin [88, 89]

. Deletion of NAT4 exacerbates the DNA damage sensitivity of rad51Δ cells ( Fig 1D ), and this additive effect suggests that the DNA damage hypersensitivity caused by lack of NAT4 is unlikely to be due to HR-mediated DNA repair defects per se. Overall, these findings suggest that Nat4 has a role in regulating the susceptibility of yeast cells to DNA damage and propose that Nat4 may be involved in DDR signaling

. The above results so far implicate Nat4 in the cellular response to DNA damage, but exclude it from being involved in the DNA repair process per se ( Fig 1D ). Therefore, to further investigate this link, we then examined the effect of Nat4 on the DDR signaling cascade starting with the levels of H2AS129ph, the well-characterized DNA damage-induced modification [23, 27]

. Considering that Nat4 and its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity towards histone H4 is preserved from yeast to humans [5], we envision that its human ortholog NAA40 may be linked to processes safeguarding the genome. In summary, our work unveils a new role for Nat4 in DDR, which serves as a paradigm among the NAT family of enzymes and their mediated protein N-terminal acetylation in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage.

. The precise role of Nat4 recruitment at the DNA break site remains unclear. One possibility is that Nat4 and its mediated Nt-AcH4 could be cross-talking with other histone modifications at DSBs to allow recruitment of the repairing machinery. For instance, acetylation at lysines 5, 8, 12 on histone H4 ( H4K5, 8, 12ac ) promotes chromatin relaxation and subsequently facilitates DSB repair [78]

. In line with the Nat4 acetyltransferase activity influencing the DDR signaling cascade, we observed that the H4S1A mutation results in comparable growth sensitivity to MMS-induced DNA damage, as seen in cells lacking NAT4 ( compare Fig 6A to Fig 1A )

. After MMS-induced damage, both H2AS129ph levels and Rad53 phosphorylation were similarly reduced in the double mutant strain H4S1Anat4Δ as in the single H4S1A and nat4Δ mutants ( Fig 6F and 6G, respectively ), suggesting an epistatic interaction whereby the nat4Δ effect is mediated through histone H4. Collectively, the above data show that Nat4 effects in DDR signaling and DDC dynamics are mediated through its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4

. Interestingly, in yeast cells expressing hNAA40, the global distribution of H2AS129ph during MMS treatment, as well as Rad53 phosphorylation levels were rescued back to wild-type levels ( Fig 5A and 5B ), indicating that Nat4 effects in DDR and checkpoint signaling are mediated through N-terminal acetylation of histone H4 and not of H2A

. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that Set2-mediated histone methylation on H3K36 is necessary for DNA damage checkpoint stimulation and proper DNA end resection at the DSB [87]. Since these Set2-associated effects are similar to the results presented here for nat4Δ and the H4S1A mutant, future work could explore the interplay between these and other epigenetic modifiers upon DNA damage to control the DDR

An important aspect for efficient response to DNA damage is the rearrangement of chromatin surrounding the damaged genomic sites to facilitate accessibility to the repair machinery [71]. Histone modifying enzymes and their mediated modifications play a crucial role in these chromatin rearrangements [60, 64, 72, 73]

. Previous work showed that Nat4-mediated cellular functions are attributed to its histone acetyltransferase activity [11, 12, 14, 53, 70]. Therefore, we next investigated whether nat4Δ-associated effects in DDR were dependent on its acetyltransferase activity towards histones. To accomplish this, we employed yeast cells bearing wild-type or catalytically mutant Nat4 ( nat4 ( E186Q ) - ) and histone mutant H4 ( H4SAnat ) with non-acetylated at the N-terminus ( Fig 4B ). The results show that natΔ cells expressing catalytically inactive Nat4 exhibit similar sensitivity to MMS-induced DNA damage as cells lacking Nat ( Fig 4A ), indicating that the acetylase activity of Nat is required for its function in DDR

In conclusion, this study reveals a novel role for Nat N-terminal acetylase in the response to DNA damage and checkpoint in S cerevisiae, implicating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of histone N-terminal acetylase Nat4 in the regulation of DNA damage response and suggest that its human ortholog NAA may play a similar role in safeguarding the genome.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i. e., cancer phylogenies, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1, 000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.

    Modern cancer evolution studies generate large amounts of bulk sequencing data often containing hundreds of mutations and multiple cancer samples. This vast amount of data presents a promising opportunity to improve our understanding of the evolutionary events that drive cancer progression. Until now, existing mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) reconstruction algorithms were unable to reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations

. Here, we introduce a new MSPP reconstruction algorithm, Orchard, which reliably reconstructs extremely large mutation trees, alleviating the need to pre-cluster mutations. Orchard accurately solves MSPP problems with as many as 1000 mutations and 100 samples. We benchmark Orchard’s reconstructions against Pairtree and CALDER on 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) and 90 simulated cancers

. Our results demonstrate that Orchard can reliably match or beat ground-truth ( or expert-derived ) baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer. Orchard can recover larger trees on simulated data, and in Section A6. 4 in S1 Appendix we use Orchard to successfully reconstruct 1000-node simulated mutation trees in ≈26 hours of wall clock time

. We anticipate that improvements to the current algorithm to make it probabilistic, so that its merging choices are made based on an appropriate likelihood function, will result in even greater performance. We further anticipate the development of new algorithms that utilize large mutations trees reconstructed by Orchard

. Phylogenies describing the ancestral relationships of subclones in an individual cancer can reveal important evolutionary events, help to characterize the cancer’s heterogeneity [5] and progression [6, 7], support the discovery of new driver mutations [8], and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens [9]. Many cancer evolution studies use bulk DNA from multiple cancer samples to reconstruct phylogenies depicting the evolution of subclones in an individual cancer [10–16]

. These phylogenies are also prerequisites for inferring migration histories of metastases [17, 18]. A mutation tree is an arborescence that can represent portions of a cancer phylogeny that satisfy the infinite sites assumption ( ISA ). The ISA posits that each mutation is acquired only once and is never reverted. A phylogeny that adheres to the ISA is a perfect phylogeny; cancer phylogenies are often perfect because of low mutation rates ( ∼1–10 mutations / megabase ) [19]

. By definition, a mutation tree is a perfect phylogeny, and each non-root node in a mutation tree represents a somatic mutation present in one or more cancerous cell subpopulations. Bulk DNA data obtained by sequencing multiple tissue samples from the same cancer can be used to reconstruct a mutation tree by solving the mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) problem. In the MSPP problem, each cancer sample is an unknown mixture of clonal genotypes, i

. To illustrate this new strategy, we introduce a simple phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm that infers subclones from a reconstructed mutation tree. On real data, this simple algorithm recovers expert-defined subclones as well as, and often better, than state-of-the-art VAF based clustering algorithms [27–29]. Orchard, along with the phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm, is accessible for free under the MIT License at http://www. github. com/morrislab/orchard.

. These limitations necessitated clustering mutations into subclones prior to reconstructing trees, which is an error prone process [30–32]. We introduced Orchard, a novel MSPP reconstruction algorithm that uses variant allele frequency data to build large and accurate mutation trees. We derived an approximation to the mutation tree posterior, then showed how Orchard adapts Ancestral Gumbel-Top-k sampling to efficiently sample without replacements from it

. For each point mutation j, Orchard requires a set of tuples X j = { ( a j s, b j s, ω j s ) } s = 1 m, where s indexes the bulk cancer sample. The entire data set for all n mutations is represented by a set D = { X j } j = 1 n

. Reconstructing a clone tree using poorly defined subclones can yield inaccurate trees and lead to incorrect conclusions about the evolution of a cancer [31–33]. Pre-defining subclones before tree reconstruction can also result in the loss of critical information such as the partial order of mutation acquisition, which is crucial for analyzing somatic mutation patterns and determining prognosis and treatment strategies for certain hematological cancers [6, 7, 34–36]

. These results demonstrate that: ( 1 ) Orchard matches or outperforms Pairtree and CALDER on reconstruction problems with 30 or fewer mutations while being 5–10x faster, and ( 2 ) Orchard greatly outperforms both competing methods on reconstruction problems with more than 30 mutations. Orchard achieves greater accuracy and scalability for large reconstruction problems by sampling from a factorized approximation of the mutation tree posterior, a novel result derived in this paper

. Orchard’s ability to reconstruct extremely large trees motivated a new strategy where the mutation tree structure is used to guide the inference of clones and clone trees. To this end, we introduced a “phylogeny-aware” clustering algorithm that uses agglomerative clustering to infer clones and clone trees from mutation trees. There are a few potential areas of improvement for Orchard

. Orchard’s search routine finds the top-k leaves of the search tree with the largest perturbed log probabilities without exhaustive exploration [38]. To further reduce run times, Orchard employs heuristic optimizations that, empirically, do not compromise its accuracy. Orchard contains a “phylogeny-aware” clustering algorithm that uses a reconstructed mutation tree and its corresponding mutation frequency matrix F to cluster mutations into subclones and resolve clone trees

. The goal is to find B and U that admit an F with the highest possible data fit to D. The next section describes how we define a noisy MSPP problem, one step of which is estimating F ^ using the observed bulk DNA data. After that, we formally define a mutation tree. The inputs to Orchard include VAFs for n point mutations in m samples from the same cancer

. For example, these trees could be used to study patterns of somatic mutations, recover lineage-specific mutation signature activities, or identify patterns of metastatic spread [17]. The Orchard algorithm could also be adapted to reconstruct mutation trees from single-cell data, though this requires updating Orchard’s noise model and sampling routine to accommodate single cell data.

. This phenomenon was observed across all B-ALL data sets with more than 60 mutations, indicating that Pairtree’s reconstructions become increasingly less reliable with more data. In contrast, Orchard’s reconstructions exhibit excellent data fit irrespective of the number of mutations or samples. In Section A6. 6 in S1 Appendix, we conducted a similar experiment using random subsets of samples for reconstruction. The results of this experiment strongly align with those shown in Fig 4a

. 5 in S1 Appendix. Orchard and Pairtree reconstruct similarly accurate mutation trees on B-ALL data sets containing fewer than 50 mutations, but Orchard reconstructs significantly more plausible trees than Pairtree for B-ALLs with more than 50 mutations. The accuracy of Orchard’s mutation tree reconstructions, compared to Pairtree, is highlighted by further analyzing the B-ALL data set SJBALL022611. This data set has 84 mutations identified across 29 different samples

. Fig 1 depicts the relationship between t ( ℓ ) and B ( ℓ ) as mutations are added, and demonstrates how the rows and columns of the genotype matrix can be reordered without affecting the underlying tree structure. Orchard’s goal is to sample without replacement from the mutation tree posterior defined by: P ( B | D ) = P ( B, D ) P ( D ), ( 3 ) where B is a genotype matrix and D is a data set for n point mutations across m bulk samples

. Each factor in this approximate posterior represents a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylog. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogen that ultimately culminates in a tree containing all mutations. Orchard’s algorithm is based on a factorization of the tree posterior, a result derived in this paper. This factorization allows Orchard to efficiently sample from the tree without replacement, a novel result in this paper

Orchard is a phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples from a factorized approximation of the posterior over phylogen, a result in this paper. Each factor in this posterior corresponds to conditional for adding a mutation a partially phylog. Orchard optimizes each sequentially generating a sequence larger phylogen that culminates a tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate Orchard outperforms state-the-art phylog reconstruction in reconstructing more phylogen across 90 cancers and 14-proitor lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALL ). Remark, Orchard accurately reconstruct phylogen using up 1, 000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that large phylogen reconstructed Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations genetic variations among cancer subpopulations 

The final answer is: 

Orchard is a novel phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that efficiently and accurately reconstructs large trees with up to 1000 mutations. It uses a factorized approximation of the posterior over phylogen, a result derived in this paper. Each factor in the posterior corresponds to a conditional for adding a mutation to a partially phy. Orchard optimizes each factor, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogen that culminates in a tree containing all mutations. Evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art phylog reconstruction methods in reconstructing more phylogen across 90 cancers and 14-proitor lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). Remarkably, Orchard reconstructs phylogen using up 1,000 mutations. Additionally, demonstrate that large phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction ( Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0. 619, average precision: 0. 514 ), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

    CD8+ neoepitope prediction plays an important role in the development of personalised cancer therapeutics, potentially allowing for highly targeted and more effective treatments. In this work, we’ve described ImmugenX, a modular language model which achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction and can integrate new inputs such as TCRs when available

. ImmugenX is designed as a modular language modelling approach for immunogenicity prediction, with the ability to add additional features to the input of the classification head. TCR specificity as a task is performed using peptide:HLA:TCR triplets as input. The pMHC encoding module is unchanged to process the peptide:HLA paired input, with the immunogenicity classification head fine-tuned with the addition of TCR-based inputs

. Additional datasets to understand the population of low EL rank but positive reactivity epitopes in the datasets would be highly valuable. ImmugenX provides a strong framework for immunogenicity prediction using a modular protein language model which achieves state-of-the-art level performance at predicting immunogenicity on publicly available CD8+ reactivity data.

A sub-module of ImmugenX was trained to encode peptide-MHC input pairs for downstream immunogenicity prediction by training iteratively on related pMHC prediction tasks. This allows us to use all available data on immunogenicity related pMHC prediction tasks in the training of ImmugenX. Performance on these sub-tasks was assessed by comparison to state-of-the-art models at each stage. First, the BA task was assessed against MHCFlurry 2

. ImmugenX comprises a pMHC submodule, trained sequentially on multiple pMHC prediction tasks. In the first instance, this provides the input embeddings for an immunogenicity prediction head model to perform pMHC-only immunogenicity prediction. ImmugenX is also extendable to additional patient-specific inputs, by appending embeddings from purpose-trained encoding networks, demonstrated here with TCR sequences

. This iterative training method produced a high performance pMHC module for use in downstream immunogenicity task training. The full ImmugenX model for pMHC prediction, shown in Fig 2A, was further trained on CD8+ assay data to predict immunogenicity of a given pMHC pair

. For benchmarking ImmugenX for pMHC immunogenicity prediction two variants were compared. One with the pMHC module trained up until the EL task and another with the full training including the stability prediction task to assess the utility of this additional training task to immunogenicity. ImmugenX was compared to pMHC binding/elution models netMHCpan 4. 1 [5] and MHCFlurry 2. 0 [6], the pMHC stability model netMHCstabpan [11], along with the pMHC immunogenicity models PRIME 2

. To demonstrate the utility of ImmugenX as an architecture for immunogenicity prediction utilising the full peptide-MHC-TCR triplet input, we initially compare it to two recent TCR specificity models using data splits provided by the authors to provide a fair comparison. These experiments have the goal of demonstrating ImmugenX as a model design is capable of using TCR information in its predictions

. Due to low volumes of training data and small independent test datasets, these models have generally shown improved performance at the time of publication but some reduced performance on new data as it becomes available. This indicates current models do not yet represent highly generalisable underlying features of immunogenic neoantigens. TCR specificity is also a relevant task to immunogenicity prediction, especially when considering the application of personalised therapy design

. While these datasets are currently limited in scope, next-generation screening methods may greatly increase volumes of paired data in the coming years [20], meaning an increase in TCR data from which to retrain existing models. Integrating TCR prediction into an immunogenicity model would allow it to take full advantage of these new datasets. Here we present ImmugenX a modular immunogenicity prediction protein language model based on the transformer architecture

. These experiments demonstrate ImmugenX is able to use TCR information to perform prediction tasks at a comparable level to alternative designs seen in state-of-the-art models. The previous experiments demonstrated ImmugenX as an architecture for TCR specificity tasks, showing its ability to use information from TCR-based inputs. An additional experiment was conducted to investigate whether having patient TCR information would assist in predicting the immunogenicity of a pMHC complex

. ImmugenX as an architecture demonstrated strong performance at two TCR specificity tasks from previous publications [17, 16] indicating that it is highly capable of integrating TCR inputs, including up to full chain alpha and beta chains, into predictions. We show that integrating CDR3β chains into an immunogenicity prediction task can provide an improvement in performance in the limited set of test neoantigens currently available

. Additional analyses were performed to assess sources of difference between ImmugenX and other models on the pMHC immunogenicity task, shown in Fig 7. The ImmugenX stability pMHC module produces scores which are highly correlated with netMHCstabpan [11] ( Pearson’s R = 0. 806 ), a widely used pMHC stability prediction tool. This is expected as they share a training dataset but differ on pre-training steps and architecture

. The phased training approach used in ImmugenX allows for the possible inclusion of TCR data, without being limited by the low volume of paired peptide-TCR data available for training an end-to-end model. The ImmugenX architecture has the advantage of being extendable, both to additional pre-training-based embeddings through new pMHC tasks and to additional feature inputs such as TCR sequences

. ImmugenX and the models benchmarked in this work focus on HLA class I presented epitopes, recognised by CD8+ T-cells, as the definition of immunogenicity; however, a similar architecture and training approach could in future be applied to class II and CD4+ reactivities. There are many models focused on predicting prerequisite steps to T-cell recognition. Binding affinity ( BA ) models such as netMHCpan ( 3

. While there is limited data available in the test set, these results indicate that improved neoantigen ranking could be achieved when a TCR context is available as model input. pMHC encoding features were analysed for their relation to underlying physiochemical features, such as those that could be used in an immunogenicity model with engineered features

. The phased pre-training approach detailed here allows for the integration of multiple pMHC complex-specific tasks in the model weights, providing a useful embedding for downstream pMHC immunogenicity modelling at state-of-the-art performance levels. This was shown with a strict separation of datasets, ensuring all test peptides were unseen by the model in any previous task at every point of training

. While these results are limited by available data, this work demonstrates the potential gains from integrating TCR information into immunogenicity prediction. The extendable design of ImmugenX allows for additional features to be integrated by adding to the feature sentence structure as shown with TCRs. Features which have been established to impact immunogenicity, such as expression levels [13] and antigen clonality [29] could similarly be appended to the ImmugenX inputs

. Predictions based on these pMHC tasks are all known to correlate with T-cell immunogenicity. Direct predictors of immunogenicity have also been developed, with many using the above pMHC models as a basis. PRIME uses the MixMHCpred affinity rank, along with likely TCR interacting amino acids from the epitope as input to a neural network [7]. Gartner et al

The article presents Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on peptide-MHC immunogenic prediction and integrates T-cell receptor (TCR) information. Immugen is designed as a modular approach with a peptide-MHC encoding module trained on multiple MHC prediction tasks and an immunogenic classification head fine-tuned with TCR inputs. The model outperforms compared models on MHC immunogenic prediction with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the best model. Immugen shows improved performance on immunogenic prediction with the integration of TCR information. The model is extendable to additional features such as TCR sequences and has a phased training approach allowing the inclusion of T data without being limited by the volume of paired-TC data. Immugen is compared to state-of-the models on MHC binding, elution, and stability tasks and outperforms on MHC immunogenic prediction. The model is further analysed for interpretability and locates areas of weakness in existing models and highlights biases in public datasets. Immugen provides a strong framework for immunogenic prediction using a modular language model achieving state-the performance on publicly available CD8 reactivity data.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The quality of meat is important to the consumer. Color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized mainly into lightness, redness, and yellowness. Here, we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6. 24 kb QTL region ( GGA15: 6298. 34–6304. 58 kb ). This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8. 65E-08 ). The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2. 9E-12 ). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles. In addition, the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence, we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP ( rs315520807, C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity. The differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of rs315520807 variant, expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. In this study, PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color, and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected.

    We found that PPP1CC expression was causally related to breast muscle lightness and redness in chickens using large-scale genome-wide association, gene-based association analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis. Using PPP1CC-SSKO mice, we also found that lightness increased and myoglobin content decreased in the limb muscle, and the mechanisms by which PPP1CC influences meat color included myofiber-type specification

. Changes in meat lightness might be related to changes in muscle glycolytic potential [9]. The Rendement Napole gene ( RN ) [10] and phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1 ( PHKG1 ) [11] were found to be involved in glycolytic potential. However, the causal genes for meat lightness and redness have not been identified. Efficient strategies for exploring functional genes include genome-wide association studies ( GWASs ) and gene-based association analysis [12–17]

. Additionally, the findings suggested effects on meat color traits beyond PPP1CC gene expression, emphasizing the need for further study in the future. The PPP1CC is indispensable for muscle glycogen metabolism and functions by binding with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A ( PPP1R3A ). In chickens, PPP1R3A has been identified as the functional gene for the pH of the pectoralis major muscle in pH-divergent selected lines [23]

. Significant changes in the meat lightness and myoglobin content in the limb muscles of this model were detected, without significant differences in meat redness. Further comparison via metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested that consistent differences in gene expression and metabolites related to glycolysis occurred

. Understanding the genetic basis of meat color is important for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology. Some causative or related genes for meat color have been identified in chickens and domestic pigs. Strong relationships between beta-carotene oxygenase 1 ( BCO1 ) [7] and chicken yellowness and between myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) [8] and redness/intramuscular fat in pig skeletal muscle have been reported

. A relatively short induction period to downregulate target gene expression was more suitable for the study of post-slaughter traits. In the present study, the causative gene and potential causative variant of chicken breast muscle color lightness and redness were identified through a combination of GWAS, gene-based association analysis, and MR analysis

. The divergence of meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of the variant rs315520807, expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were compared between these two breeds. Compared with those of local chickens, the breast muscles of fast-growing white-feathered chickens presented a significant increase ( P < 0. 01 ) in L*15 min and a notable decrease ( P < 0. 01 ) in a*15 min ( Fig 6A and 6B )

. The gene-based association analysis, which associations at the gene level by aggregating genotypes for each gene [17], indicated that only PPP1CC at the loci was significantly associated with the meat color L* and a* values. To confirm the causal relationships, MR analysis was used to provide more solid evidence for causal inference between PPP1CC expression and target traits. The results revealed that PPP1CC has negative effects on meat color L* and positive effects on a*

. 58 kb had strong LD ( r2 > 0. 8, Fig 1B ). Moreover, we performed gene-based association analysis and identified 11, 821 gene–trait association pairs ( Figs 1C and S2 ). The results revealed that only PPP1CC was significantly associated with the meat color L* and a* values ( P = 8. 65E-08 and 1. 47E-07, respectively ). The causal relationship between L*15 min and PPP1CC expression was robust ( P Weighted median < 2. 91E-12, P Inverse variance weighted < 8. 32E-25 )

. 05, S3 Table ). The funnel plot also revealed no evidence of obvious heterogeneity across the estimates, indicating the absence of potential pleiotropic effects ( S3C and S3D Fig ). These results provide solid evidence that meat color traits ( L*15 min and a*15 min ) may be regulated by PPP1CC gene expression

. In our study, the expression of PPP1R3A decreased in PPP1CC-SSKO mice ( fold change = 0. 75, P = 0. 01 ). Previous studies on PP1 have focused on its regulatory subunits and shown that disruption of gene expression causes weight gain, insulin resistance, and fat deposition [24]. The clarification of the role of PPP1CC in meat color is reported here for the first time

In this study, we assessed meat color using the L* and a* phenotypes. We performed a GWAS by using 230 individuals and more than nine million SNPs to calculate a genome-wide distribution via genome resequencing, and the results revealed that only one significant signal was observed on chromosome 15, which might be associated with chicken meat color

. Meat color is a complex trait because it is influenced by both muscle development and tissue metabolism. Muscle cells remain metabolically active after slaughter. Studying animals in vivo is the preferred approach for verifying gene function and exploring the underlying mechanisms involved

. The curves in the scatter diagram revealed that there were still some effects on meat color traits other than PPP1CC gene expression, but these effects were independent of these instrument variables ( IVs ). The PPP1CC-SSKO mice with a genotype of PPP1CC ( fl/fl; ACTA1-creER ( Tg ) ) and control mice with a genotype of PPP1CC ( fl/fl; ACTA1-creER ( 0 ) ) were constructed using the Cre/loxP system ( Fig 3A )

. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that the SNP rs315520807 ( C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate gene transcription activity. The differences in the meat color phenotypes and related indices between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens support the conclusions above

. This discrepancy in meat color is also consistent with the increased frequency of the potential causative variant rs315520807 mutant type TT ( 51% vs 11% ) and the decreased expression of PPP1CC in fast-growing chicken breeds, which may also be related to variations in muscle fiber types, as evidenced by the heightened expression of type II marker genes in fast-growing breeds

. The frequency of the rs315520807 wild type CC in the fast-growing chickens is 10%, which can serve as an effective genetic marker in breeding programs for improving meat color and reducing the incidence of PSE-like meat. There are several limitations of the current study. The downregulation of PPP1CC was related to the lightness change 15 min after slaughter, but the corresponding lightness changes observed in PPP1CC-SSKO mice were recorded 24 h after slaughter

. 60%, and that of b*15 min was 15. 91%. To identify QTLs affecting chicken meat color, we performed a GWAS for the L* and a* values of breast muscle from 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens with 9, 760, 228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ). The results revealed a significant association with the QTL on chromosome 15 ( GGA 629. 34–630.58 kb ), which contained the PPPCC gene. The causal relationship between PPPCC and meat color was further validated through Mendelian randomization ( P < 2.9E-12 ). The expression of PPP1 in PPPCC-SS mice decreased myoglobin content in limb muscles and shifted myofibers from slow-twitch to fast-twitch. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis showed that inhibition of PPP1 decreased expression of slow-twitch myiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. Functional validation through plasmid reporter revealed that SNP ( rs520807 C > T ) in the intron of PPPCC regulated gene activity. Differences in meat phenotypes myoglobin frequency rs520 variant expression PPPCC and fast-twitch marker were detected between fast-growing-feathered and local chickens. This study identified PPPCC as the causative gene for color and novel gene variant that can aid in innovation of meat technology

The final answer is: 

A team of researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness. They found that the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPPCC) was associated with meat color, with a p-value of 8.65E-08. The causal relationship between PPPCC expression and lightness was further validated through Mendelian randomization with a p-value of 2.9E-12. Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPPCC knockout (PPPCSKO) mice were generated and showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in limb muscles. Transcript and metabolome analysis revealed that inhibition of PPP decreased expression of slow-twitch myiber and my-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. Functional validation through plasm reporter revealed that a SNP (rs520 C T) in the intron of PPP could regulate gene activity. Differences in meat phenotypes myoglobin frequency rs520 variant expression PPP and fastwitch marker were detected between fast-growing-feather and local chickens. This study identified PPP as the causative gene for color and novel gene variant that can aid in innovation of meat technology.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to identify the functional subunits within a ganglion cell's receptive field in the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently locate and reconstruct the subunits. Simulations demonstrate that STR can identify subunits across various model variations and experimental recordings of primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. The technique can reveal sub layouts in a few minutes, making it ideal for online and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure in retina. 

The STR method uses the center-sur structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen sub responses and superolve them below the scale of subunits, allowing tomographic reconstruction of sub. A simplified gang cell model was extended to test STR in a realistic setting, combining principles of stimulated emission microscopy and computed tomography. The technique was investigated via electrophysiological recordings from primate ganglion cells. Rapid sub identification leaves time to use sub layouts for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. Knowing sub locations, stimuli can be manufactured to characterize spatiemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic of each sub, and their similarity across sub within gang cell field. Interactions between bipolar cells were taken into account, an alternative method might locate sub more consistently, reduce effects in reconstruction, and determine sub shape accurately.

    Title: 
    Abstract: An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ). Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate. The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features. However, the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate. We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ). To capture this interaction, we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, some of these methods generate far more significant interactions, likely including many false positives, whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data. 

    Supporting Text:
   . The CRISPRi-DR method described in this paper extends this previous work by showing how effects of both drug concentration and sgRNA efficiency can be accommodated in the same model. Ideally, interacting genes would be expected to exhibit synergistic behavior with a drug, where depletion of a target protein induces excess depletion ( or enrichment ) of the mutants grown in the presence of an inhibitor, and this effect is concentration-dependent ( exhibits dose-response behavior )

. Thus, the main requirements for CRISPRi-DR are that: a ) there are multiple sgRNAs for each target in the library, b ) the sgRNAs vary in predicted strength, and c ) the actual efficiencies of the sgRNAs ( i. e. growth defects due to target depletion ) have been experimentally quantified in control conditions, as an input to the analysis method. The primary use case we focus on is identification of chemical-genetic interactions, with drug concentration as a covariate

. In fact, in chemical-genetic interaction experiments, variable sgRNA efficiency can be further exploited to identify genes whose level of depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration. We developed the CRISPRi-DR model with this use case in mind, extending the Hill equation, which quantifies dose-response behavior of a growth inhibitor, to incorporate an extra term representing the relative efficiency of each of the sgRNAs targeting a gene

. Our CRISPRi-DR model incorporates both sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration as parameters, and captures the non-linear interaction between them, where the "slopes" for the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants can be larger in magnitude for sgRNAs of intermediate efficiency, while being flatter ( slopes closer to 0 ) for sgRNAs of high or low efficiency

. This contrasts with our approach, where we advocate selecting sgRNAs with a diversity of efficiencies, since we observed that the sgRNAs that exhibited the most synergy with drug treatments were not always the strongest or weakest, but somewhere in the middle of the range. For application to CGI experiments, the availability of CRISPRi data for multiple sgRNAs of varying strengths for each target gene presents new challenges for statistical analysis

. This can differentially affect the accuracy of predictions of gene-drug interaction made by these models. Three replicate counts were collected for estimating the relative abundance of each CRISPRi mutant ( with a unique sgRNA ) in the presence of a drug at a given concentration

. Although one could contemplate adding the efficiency of each sgRNA into a simple regression model to predict abundances for each gene, a significant problem ( expanded upon below ) is that sgRNAs of different efficiency can show different concentration dependence, resulting in non-linear interactions among variables. In this paper, we propose a modified regression approach for CRISRPi data ( called CRISPRi-DR ) that incorporates both drug concentration and sgRNA efficiency

. This can be quantified beforehand by evaluating the growth rate of individual CRISPRi mutants ( with unique sgRNAs ) in a growth experiment and determining the actual fitness defect caused by target knockdown [11, 12]. In highly vulnerable genes, the effect of protein depletion by sgRNAs on cell growth rate ( efficiency ) can span a range from no effect to severe growth defect. Early applications of CRISPR were primarily being used to fully inactivate genes ( e. g

. CRISPRi-DR is applicable to libraries where there are multiple sgRNAs representing each gene with a range of efficiencies, which can be quantified empirically as an effect on growth rate ( fitness defect ). The diversity of efficiencies is useful for identifying synergistic effects with treatments/conditions

. By this definition, highly vulnerable genes are genes for which even small depletion of the encoded protein causes growth impairment, which can be quantified efficiently on a genome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing [12]. The vulnerability of a gene can be both condition dependent and strain or cell type dependent [12]. One interesting application of CRISPRi is to reveal targets of antibiotics or mechanisms of resistance through chemical-genetic interactions ( CGI ) [7, 13]

. 05 ( i. e. where ebFDR < 0. 05 ). To evaluate the relative importance of the sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration features to the CRISPRi-DR model, each gene was fit with two ablated models: Md and Ms. The Md model contained only log concentration as a predictor: log ( Aijk1−Aijk ) =B∙log ( [Dj] ) +C and the Ms model only contained sgRNA efficiency as a predictor: log ( Aijk1−Aijk ) =B∙Si+C

. In theory, both CRISPRi depletion of essential genes and exposure to antibiotics should impair growth of CRISPRi mutants ( at least for depletion of essential genes ). One might expect to observe a depletion effect due to either increasing sgRNA efficiency, or drug concentration, each producing regression "slopes" ( in log-transformed space ), with slopes for sgRNAs targeting non-essential genes being expected to be flat, regardless of predicted sgRNA strength

. Some of these methods incorporate multiple drug concentrations, while other incorporate sgRNA efficiency as an input to their models. However, only MAGeCK-MLE incorporates both types of input. The importance of incorporating both inputs in CRISPRi-DR was demonstrated via an experiment with ablated models; the model fits ( AICs ) for each gene were significantly worse for models that regressed abundances against either drug concentration or sgRNA efficiency alone

. Third, the actual efficiency of each sgRNA must be empirically quantified a priori, such as by running a growth experiment and comparing growth rates with and without induction of the dCAS9 ( hence, with and without depletion of target genes ). These quantities become inputs to the model. The CRISPRi-DR method can be applied to any CRISPRi dataset that meets these requirements. The methodology works best when treatment produces a sigmoidal effect on mutant abundances

. For each drug, the CRISPRi-DR model is run on each gene ( using data from D1 ). The coefficient for the slope of concentration dependence ( βc ) is extracted from the fitted regression and used to rank the genes both in increasing order ( for depletion ) and inversely ( for enrichment ). Green reflects results consistent with expectations based on knowledge of known gene-drug interactions Genes that encode the target of a drug would typically be expected to have a high depletion rank, i

. Among all the existing CRISPR analytical methods, MAGeCK-MLE [15] is the only other method that explicitly includes sgRNA efficiencies as an input, which are used to set the prior probabilities that each sgRNA is effective or not ( because of their focus on CRISPRko ) in the joint probability formula, to initialize for the Expectation Maximization iterations. In the application to CGI data, a regression model can be used to integrate data over multiple drug concentrations [20]

. However, we observed that sgRNA efficiency and concentration effects are not independent—they interact in a non-linear way. sgRNAs that are too weak do not produce enough depletion of a drug target to cause sensitization, and sgRNAs that are too strong deplete a mutant to such low abundances that concentration-dependent effects are difficult to quantify

. The r2 values and results of the AIC-based likelihood comparison indicate that sgRNA efficiency contributes strongly to accuracy of the model, and reinforces the importance of including sgRNA efficiency as a term in the CRISPRi-DR model. The improved performance of CRPR-DR compared to other methods was also observed in simulated data, where we generated CRPR data with known interactions and compared the performance of CRPR-DR to other methods.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks. 

    Supporting Text:
   . One aspect we did not explore here is the estimation of the gene co-expression network itself, before any attempt at finding communities. Both methods used weighted networks: fully connected ones for the WGCNA ( as per this methods’ suggested workflow ) and a sparser network for the SBM model fitting

Here, we find that non-modular blocks are widespread in gene co-expression networks, and that the evidence for their functional relevance is as strong as for modular blocks. This highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information, beyond assortativity, when exploring biological networks. More studies using methods that don’t rely on modularity maximization will be needed to determine whether there are general patterns of non-modular organization.

. Methods like the graphical lasso have been used in this context [42–44], and the expectation is that, when compared to fully connected or thresholded networks, these inferred networks should provide much better estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. Additionally, it is possible to combine community detection via the SBM with network inference, simultaneously using information about community structure to inform the network inference and vice-versa [45]

. To explicitly address this possibility of alternative organizations, we use a more general measure of similarity that allows us to find meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation. This approach is implemented in the weighted nested Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model [14, wnDC-SBM, or SBM for brevity, 15], which has shown promising results in similar applications [16, 17]

. The trimmed networks ( Fig 3 panels B and F ) maintained the essential structure of the original correlation matrices while removing potentially spurious edges that we lack the statistical power to identify. To assess the consequences of assuming that communities in transcriptional networks are assortative, we compared the performance of a clustering algorithm that relies on assortativity ( WGCNA ) to the performance of the SBM

. For this, we run both clustering algorithms on the same gene co-expression matrices. To distinguish between gene clusters derived from the SBM and WGCNA, we refer to the former as ‘blocks’, and to the latter as ‘modules’. Gene clustering for all methods is presented in S1 Table. Using the SBM, in both Drosophila head and body RNAseq datasets, we were able to cluster all genes, identifying a nested partition with 5 levels ( Fig 4 )

. The way we process the gene expression data is an integral part of the clustering method we are comparing, even if they lead to different networks. Our intention here was to compare the full workflow, not the specific clustering on a particular network. Given this, we present the results using WGCNA’s proposed workflow below and add the FDR trimmed version of WGCNA to the S2 Fig. Using the trimmed version of the network in WGCNA does not significantly change the main results

. The very high dimensionality of gene co-expression networks also allows for genes to be similar in ways that do not lead to high correlations. For example, two genes might be connected to the same genes in different communities, but not among themselves ( like the non-assortative block in Fig 3E ). This similarity would likely be missed by modularity maximization or hierarchical clustering because these genes would not form a classic assortative unit

. We accomplish this by taking the first 5 traits and setting the correlations between them to a value lower than the across module correlations ( Fig 3E ). We then repeat the sampling and inference procedure, producing a new trimmed network ( Fig 3F ), an SBM fit on this network ( Fig 3G ), and a WGCNA fit on this network ( Fig 3H ). We assess the biological relevance of the clustering obtained by each method by comparing their gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment

. Other methods borrow from network analysis and attempt to explicitly maximize the Newman Modularity [10] of the weighted gene network. For example, Modulated Modularity Clustering [MMC, 11] uses an adaptive algorithm to find a non-linear distance between genes based on their correlations that maximizes the number of modules uncovered by maximizing modularity

. Due to the large dimensionality of gene expression data, often composed of several thousands of gene expression measures, a major tool in the analysis of co-expression is gene clustering: separating the genes into related groups, which can then be explored separately [2]. This drastically reduces the number of genes we need to consider at the same time and allows for the identification of hubs or centrally connected genes that can be used to inform further experimental validation [3, 4]

. The question is, given a co-expression network, how should we cluster the genes? The general idea behind several methods is to look for similar genes, as these are expected to be involved in related biological functions. However, several definitions of similarity have been used. The most basic measure of similarity borrows from classical morphological integration theory and attempts to find gene modules based on their correlations

. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis [WGCNA, 3] uses a power transformation of the correlation between gene expression ( or a topological similarity measure built with these transformed correlations ) [8, 9] as a similarity measure that is then separated into assortative modules using hierarchical clustering. One of the main objectives of WGCNA is finding hub genes, which have high connectivity within modules and are clearly identified by hierarchical clustering

. While the procedures we used here are commonplace, there are more principled ways of building co-expression networks [41], and this is an aspect of the usual transcriptomics workflow that could potentially see massive improvements in the near future

. We use a signed network ( as opposed to ignoring the sign of the correlation between genes ) because inspection of the gene network graph reveals large groups of genes linked by negative correlations in our data, suggesting a large-scale structure that would be obscured by using the unsigned method. Signed similarity has been shown to lead to more robust modules [29], and in tuning WGCNA we were able to cluster more genes and find more modules using the signed method

. Because the SBM does not use modularity maximization to find communities, we were able to use the resulting clustering to measure, in an unbiased manner, the assortativity of individual blocks and the overall degree of modularity of the transcriptional networks in the head and the body. We find that modularity and assortativity are markedly lower in the body ( Fig 6 )

. The latter, however, could not have been identified by methods that assume assortative modules. The possibility of quantifying, in a continuous scale, the degree of assortativity of each gene block allowed us to compare the gene co-expression networks derived from head and body tissue, and uncover marked differences in their overall degree of modularity. These results warrant a discussion about the origin of the assumption that gene expression networks are modular

Gene co-expression networks inform our understanding of cell and organismal function by encoding associations between genes. Associations between expression levels can indicate common function, and the number of connections can point to central or regulatory genes [1]

Elsewhere [20], we quantified whole-genome gene expression in hundreds of outbred Drosophila melanogaster female flies using a high-throughput RNAseq library preparation protocol [TM3seq, 21]. To build the gene co-expression networks, here we use a subset of the full dataset that includes: samples for two tissues, head ( n = 212 ) and body ( n = 252 ), individuals with the best coverage ( average gene counts: head = 4. 65M, body = 4

. By measuring the modularity of the identified clusters, we can compare networks with respect to their modularity without the problem of comparing a measure that was maximized to find the clusters in the first place.

The researchers used a new method called the Weighted Corrected Stochastic Model (SBM) to analyze gene expression data from fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and found that the genes are organized in a more complex way than previously thought. Unlike other methods, the SBM doesn't assume that genes are grouped into "modules" that are similar to each other. Instead, it looks at all the information in the data to separate genes into hierarchical blocks. They found that the SBM found 10 times more groups than other methods and that some of these groups are not "modular", meaning they don't fit the traditional idea of genes being similar to each other. They also found that these non-modular groups are just as important as modular groups in terms of function. This challenges the idea that modularity is the main way genes are organized in the transcriptome.

The researchers also compared the SBM to a method that assumes modularity (WNA) and found that the SB found more groups and was more accurate. They also found that non-modular groups are widespread in gene networks and are just as important as modular. This highlights the need to look beyond modularity when studying gene networks. They suggest using methods that don't rely on modularity, like graphical lasso, to see if there are other patterns of organization.

The researchers used a new measure of similarity that allows for non-modular groups to have biological meaning. They used a trimmed network to remove spurious edges and found the same results. They compared the SB to WNA on the same network and found the same results. The high dimensionality of gene data allows genes to be similar in ways that don't lead to high correlations, like non-assortative blocks. They used a trimmed network to remove spurious edges and found same results.

The researchers found that modularity and assortativity are lower in the body than the head. This could not be identified by methods that assume modularity. They quantified the degree of assortativity of each block and found differences between head and body. This challenges the assumption that gene networks are modular.

The researchers used a signed network to find groups linked by negative correlations. They found more modules and clusters using signed. The SB doesn't use modularity to find communities, so they could measure assortativity and modularity unbiased. They found modularity and assort are lower in body than head. This could not be identified by methods that assume modularity. They quantified the degree of assortativity of each block and found differences between head and body. This challenges the assumption that gene networks are modular.

The researchers used a new method to analyze gene expression data and found that genes are organized in a more complex way than thought. They used a method that doesn't assume modularity and found more groups and was accurate. They found non-mod groups are just as important as modular in function. This challenges the idea that modularity is main way genes are organized. They suggest looking beyond modularity when studying networks.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail, we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. Collectively, our results indicate that, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins, elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation.

   . High-throughput approaches exploring transcriptome-wide effects of PABPC depletion have been carried out in mammalian cells [40, 41], but none have been done in yeast. Consistent with observations in mammalian cells, we found that deletion of yeast PAB1 resulted in major changes in the transcriptome ( Fig 1B ), but only minimal changes in relative translation efficiency ( TE ) ( Fig 5A ). We showed that pab1Δ cells also drastically changed their proteome ( Fig 1A )

. However, it is unclear whether the translation efficiency phenotypes characterized in pab1Δpbp1Δ cells follow from the loss of Pab1’s direct role in translation initiation, as we cannot rule out an indirect effect of PAB1 deletion on translation initiation factor levels. As shown in the analysis of transcriptome and proteome changes in response to PAB1 deletion, some initiation factors were reduced at both mRNA and protein levels ( Fig 2A, top left )

. Hence, we explored the phenotypes of mRNA decay, translation initiation, translation efficiency, and translation termination upon PAB1 deletion, focusing on analyses of pab1Δpbp1Δ cells relative to pbp1Δ cells, and then considered whether the observed changes were direct or indirect effects of PAB1 deletion. Among its many functions, PABPC has important regulatory roles in mRNA decay [1–3]

. Our proteomics data have provided insights to the direct vs. indirect consequences of PAB1 deletion and suggested a new layer of complexity to interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells. PABPC’s role in translation initiation has been elusive, partly because the extent of its activity is dependent on the stoichiometry between PABPC, poly ( A ) tracts, and basal translation levels [40], and these experimental conditions frequently vary between studies

. Consistent with this notion, ribosome footprints in the 5’-UTR region are slightly increased in the pab1Δpbp1Δ strain relative to the other two strains ( Fig 4B ). Next, we considered motif-dependent regulation of translation initiation. First, recruitment of Pab1 to poly ( A ) tracts in the 5’-UTR was reported to induce internal cap-independent initiation in yeast [74]

To investigate proteome- and transcriptome-wide abundance changes when Pab1 is absent, we performed mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and ribosome profiling analyses of yeast cells harboring a PAB1 deletion. Because PAB1 is an essential gene, the deletion was created in a pbp1Δ background, which suppresses pab1Δ lethality [55], and we used the PAB1/pbp1Δ strain as our wild-type PAB1 control

. Pab1 is thought to promote translation initiation by aiding the association of the 40S ribosomal subunit and the eIF4F complex with the mRNA 5’ cap through a direct interaction with eIF4G [2, 26, 29, 30, 66, 67]. Translation initiation defects may thus be expected when PAB1 is deleted. To investigate translation initiation, we analyzed ribosome profiling data of WT, pbp1Δ, and pab1Δpbp1Δ cells

. The significant reduction in ribosomal proteins suggests that global translation rates would decrease, yet we find TE of most mRNAs to be unchanged ( Fig 5A ), indicating that global mRNA levels are also decreased as a consequence of PAB1 deletion. Further, we provided the first evidence for a transcriptome-wide translation termination defect ( Figs 4 and 8A ). These results demonstrated the vast pleiotropic aspects of PAB1 deletion

. However, we observed subtle increased accumulation of ribosomes at the canonical AUG start codon and in the 5’-UTR region in the pab1Δpbp1Δ strain ( Fig 4B ), indicating a possible translation initiation defect in the absence of Pab1. To determine whether deletion of PAB1 affected initiation rates of all mRNAs equally, we assessed the change in relative translation efficiency ( TE ) of each mRNA between pab1Δpbp1Δ and pbp1Δ strains ( Fig 5A )

. Since deletion of the PAB1 gene in yeast is lethal, we also deleted PBP1, which suppresses this lethality. Surprisingly, single deletion pbp1Δ cells showed an apparent increase in readthrough efficiency compared to WT cells ( Fig 8A ), raising a question whether Pbp1 plays a role in translation termination. However, this is unlikely for several reasons

. Depletion of PABPC1 in mammalian cells had minimal effects on transcriptome-wide translation efficiency [40, 41], suggesting that the stimulatory effect of PABPC on translation initiation may be restricted to circumstances where translation initiation efficiency is rate-limited. In addition to its interactions with initiation factors, PABPC also interacts with the release factor eRF3 via its PAM2 motif in metazoans and its P-C domains in yeast [2, 6, 42–45]

. These results raised the question of whether the roles of Pab1 in translation and mRNA stability borne out of Pab1 perturbation experiments are at least partially attributable to this reduction in key proteins in these pathways in addition to Pab1’s direct roles in these processes

. To further investigate how deletion of PAB1 impacts translation initiation, we characterized 470 completely spliced mRNAs that showed significant increases ( “Up” ) or decreases ( “Down” ) in relative TE in response to PAB1 deletion. We found that mRNAs with increased TE are those that are generally more abundant in the WT Pab1 condition ( pbp1Δ cells ) ( Fig 5B, orange ) but become relatively depleted upon PAB1 deletion ( Fig 5C, orange )

. e., reduction of initiation factor levels cannot be completely ruled out as an explanation for the translation initiation defects observed in pab1Δ cells

Numerous biochemical, structural, in vitro, and in vivo studies of specific mRNAs have identified pleiotropic roles for PABPC in cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation, translation initiation, and translation termination [3]. However, because of PABPC’s multiple apparent functions, defining its transcriptome-wide roles has been difficult

. Because PABPC plays major roles in the regulation of mRNA decay and translation, the termination defect and increased readthrough observed in pab1Δpbp1Δ cells can be due to: i ) loss of Pab1’s direct function in termination via its interaction with eRF3 [45, 52] or ii ) changes in the stability of release factor mRNAs or changes in their translation that result in depletion of the respective proteins, which in turn affect global termination efficiency

. Together, these results demonstrate that a notable portion of 3’-UTR footprints in pab1Δpbp1Δ cells arises from stop codon readthrough, thus suggesting that translation termination is less efficient in the absence of Pab1. To verify that the increase in stop codon readthrough is transcriptome-wide, i. e

. Therefore, to specifically assess direct and indirect consequences of deleting PABPC, we generated and analyzed mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and ribosome profiling [54] data from yeast cells lacking Pab1. As expected, protein and mRNA abundance changed substantially in pab1Δ cells

. Moreover, Pab1 appears to have preferential association with certain mRNAs [36]. Hence, it seems counterintuitive that depleting PABPC/deleting PAB1 reduces translation overall, yet relative TE is unchanged for most mRNAs [40, 41]. These observations are akin to the effects of depleting eIF4G in yeast [88]

. We found that deleting PAB1 resulted in a translation termination defect that appears to be at least partially due to reduced eRF3 protein level as well as to loss of Pab1’s stimulatory function on termination. In mammalian cells, PAB has been shown to interact with eRF3 via its PAM motif [2, 6, 42, 45] and P domains in yeast [2, 6, 42, 45]

    Title: 
    Abstract: Slow brain rhythms, for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies.

   . Finally, the conditions for which the model can be tuned into the slow bursting regime or other dynamics such as depolarization block and tonic spiking are discussed by analysis of the bifurcations in the complete system. Taken together, this study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular potassium dynamics and Na+/K+-ATPase can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond.

. Here, we explore in detail how the combination of slower, pump-dependent extracellular potassium concentration dynamics with the faster spike generating dynamics can generate slow oscillations. We analyse the bifurcation structure in a minimalistic model, focussing on the role of the Na+/K+-ATPase

. Moreover, prior studies have shown that accumulated extracellular potassium does not rapidly diffuse away from neurons, thereby providing a feedback signal that can influence neuronal dynamics [73–77]. On the modelling side, a number of studies have explored the generation of slow deterministic bursting involving changes in ion concentrations. Sætra et al

. Our study demonstrates that the interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability in class I neuron models with SNIC dynamics can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions. The general idea of generating diverse spiking dynamics via feedback from increased extracellular potassium has been previously reported and is supported by experimental evidence

. In summary, we present a minimal mechanism for deterministic bursting activity that arises from the interplay of very common spiking dynamics with changes in the extracellular potassium concentration mediated by a ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase

In order to study the emergence of slow rhythmic activity via the interactions of fast spiking and slow concentration dynamics ( i. e., fast and slow subsystems, respectively. see next sections ), a neuron model equipped with only basic fast spike-generating ion channels is placed in an external environment of fixed volume that contains extracellular potassium ions, whose concentration, [K+]out, can change ( Fig 1 )

. ( 2 ) The electrogenic and concentration-dependent Na+/K+-pump can transform the fundamental bifurcation structure such that a hysteresis loop in a concentration dimension can form under physiological conditions. The slow rhythm produced by this mechanism is expressed both at the level of neuronal spiking and ionic concentrations. It does require neither ion channels with slow dynamics nor rhythmic input via the neuronal network

. While other, more complex models, exhibit deterministic bursting too, the mechanism described in this study relies only on a minimal set of physiological assumptions in neurons and its dynamics agree with experimental observations in pathological states like epilepsy or spreading depolarization. The underlying mechanism strengthens the role of Na+/K+-ATPases in the generation of slow rhythms and their relevance as a therapeutic target in pathology

. We demonstrate that the minimal bursting mechanism analysed here requires the involvement of the Na+/K+-ATPase and ordinary K+ and Na+ channels, which are omnipresent throughout the brain. Proximity of an SNL bifurcation can be found in a generic class of neuron models, i. e. all models starting with class I excitability [21, 22], which encompass a significant proportion of neuron models, ranging from isolated gastropod somata to mammalian hippocampal neurons [25]

. Along these lines, brain regions that exhibit large-scale oscillatory behaviour often contain significant numbers of single-neuron bursters [9–11], fostering network entrainment via pacemaker neurons [2]. Theoretical and experimental research suggests that the neuron’s ability to generate bursts of activity intrinsically arises from the expression of specific ion channels, such as hyperpolarization-activated inward transient potassium channels or calcium-dependent channels [2, 12–14]

. In our model, this tuning is achieved through the electrogenic action of the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase. Due to the universality of the identified mechanism, which applies to any neuron with class I excitability, our results demonstrate the sufficiency of the Na+/K+-ATPase for the generation of slow rhythmic bursting across a large set of neuronal cell types

. The changes in extracellular potassium concentration during bursting and depolarization block in our model are consistent with experimental observations during seizures and SD, as well as during sleep rhythms [56–58]. At the core of the present burst mechanism is the SNL bifurcation and the bistable region initiating from it in the fast subsystem. The latter is bounded by the HOM and SN branches, i. e

. The number of spikes per burst is fixed ( i. e., bursting is deterministic ). The basic cycle undergone during a burst is summarised in Fig 2B. The burst relies on the bistable nature of the neuron’s dynamics between spiking and quiescence. During the spiking period, the outward flow of potassium ions is considerable. The inter-spike interval does not provide sufficient time for the Na+/K+-ATPase to pump back all K+ ions that left the cell during the spike

. Depending on Na+/K+-ATPase density and input strength, the complete concentration-dependent system exhibits four different regimes: rest, tonic spiking, bursting, and depolarisation block, which have been associated with a range of healthy and/or pathological states. For example, seizures can be triggered by a handful of neurons going through bursts of activity [53]

. Kager and colleagues indicated that [K+]out or voltage-dependent ion channels that elicit inward currents can generate seizure-like rhythmic activity, provided that the inward current secondarily triggers the release of K+ into a confined extracellular space–a set of conditions met by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Our model predictions match a number of observations in pathological states

. Sætra et al. [78] employed a Pinsky-Rinzel model to highlight the significance of considering ionic concentration dynamics, diffusion, and electrical drift. Bazhenov et al. [12] showed that increasing extracellular potassium levels, alongside various currents triggers rhythmic activity in both individual cells and networks. Also, Kager et al. [44], reported a slow bursting activity ( around 0

. For analysis of the fast, spike-generating subsystem, extracellular potassium concentration is approximated as a constant parameter. The bifurcation diagram in Fig 3 summarises the transitions in dynamics induced by changes in [K+]out. Fig 3A shows a two-parameter bifurcation diagram of the fast subsystem spanned by the parameters extracellular potassium ( [K+]out ) and applied current ( Iapp ) in the vicinity of the region used for the simulated traces in Fig 2A

. The interplay between concentration dynamics and neuronal voltage dynamics is modulated by the Na+/K+-ATPase in two-fold manner: First, the pump current directly affects the voltage dynamics. Second, the pump changes concentration gradients which, in turn, alter ionic reversal potentials. It will be shown in the subsequent section that this parsimonious setup suffices to create slow rhythms

Our findings highlight the large influence of Na+/K+-ATPases [39, 40] on the dynamics of neuronal spiking. Different isoforms of the pump are known as generic players in the homeostasis of extracellular potassium, the resting potential, as well as cell volume. Previous experimental evidence already indicated that neuronal Na+/K+-ATPase function extends beyond the stabilization of extracellular potassium

. The properties of the hysteresis loop are then further analysed in the slow-fast analysis section. The remainder of the article focuses on establishing how generic this mechanism is. Neuronal bursting consists of an oscillation governed by two time scales: one corresponding to the fast spiking dynamics and one corresponding to the slower dynamics related to concentration changes

The study explores an alternative mechanism for generating slow rhythms in neurons with class I excitability, based on the interplay between fast spiking dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. A minimalistic model reveals that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from a saddle-node bifurcation, common in class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-Pase, bursts are generated via pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization. The study suggests transitions between these dynamics result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/P activity. The model outlines the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics, potentially contributing to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and informing therapeutic strategies. The mechanism is ubiquitous, applicable to neurons with class I excitability, and demonstrates sufficiency of the Na+/Pase for generation of slow rhythmic bursting across cell types. Changes in extracellular concentration during bursting and depolar block are consistent with observations in seizures and sleep.
Researchers developed the COPS package for evaluating single and multi-omics clustering methods, focusing on robustness and prognostic relevance. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data and knowledge-driven clustering methods, incorporating cross-validation for robustness. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models with covariates, and stability of results. Survival and agreement metrics varied across methods and datasets, emphasizing the need for multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case study. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different survival outcomes. The study demonstrated COPS effectiveness in benchmarking multi-clustering to categorize patients based on multi-profiles, providing insights into multiomics analysis for cancer subtyping and implications for patient stratification and treatment.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group. C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein, SEM-2. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development, and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. First, SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Second, in addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Finally, SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Furthermore, our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.

   . We also found that SEM-2 regulates the expression of hlh-8, possibly directly, in the SMs, and that SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and the diversification of the SMs. Our work uncovered new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development, some of which are likely conserved in other species, and we add to the general understanding of the functions and structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.

. Previous studies have identified multiple transcription factors and signaling components essential for the proper development of the M lineage [2]. In particular, LIN-12/Notch signaling is known to function upstream of the single C. elegans SoxC protein, SEM-2, to specify the SM fate in the ventral M lineage, while the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9 antagonizes BMP signaling to specify the M lineage-derived CC ( M-CC for short ) fate in the dorsal side [3–6]

. sem-2 encodes the sole SoxC protein in C. elegans, whereas vertebrates have three SoxC proteins, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12 [32]. SoxC proteins have a conserved DNA-binding domain, a serine-rich region, and a transactivation domain ( Fig 2A ). Amino acid P158 is located near the end of SEM-2’s DNA-binding domain and is conserved in SoxC homologs from vertebrates ( Fig 2A )

. At the same time, SMA-9 and LET-381 are each known to repress the expression of sem-2 in the dorsal side of the M lineage to prevent it from specifying the SM fate [6]. In addition to the factors described above that are important for proper fate specification in the M lineage, the sole C. elegans Twist ortholog, HLH-8, is known to function in proper patterning of the M lineage

. HLH-8 is known to have multiple functions during M lineage development: proper cleavage orientation of M lineage cells, proper proliferation of the SMs, and proper differentiation and function of the vulval muscles [11, 12]. In this study, we provide new insight into the relationships between various factors important in M lineage development and the sole SoxC transcription factor SEM-2

. Nevertheless, our results collectively are consistent with SEM-2 playing an important, likely a direct, role in regulating the expression of hlh-8 in the M lineage. In humans Twist1, Twist2, FGFRs and JAG-1/Notch2 are known to play important roles in craniofacial development [53, 54]. The C. elegans homolog of Twist1/2 is HLH-8, the homolog of the FGFRs is EGL-15, and the homolog of JAG-1 is ARG-1 [11, 39, 55]

Metazoan development is characterized by the specification and diversification of multipotent cells, as well as the proper organization of their differentiated descendants. These processes require well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. The C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage, offers a unique model system to dissect the underlying regulatory logic of cell fate specification and diversification

. These results are consistent with altered or reduced endogenous hlh-8 expression in sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants. It is likely that SEM-2 directly regulates the expression of hlh-8 in the M lineage, through at least one of the putative SoxC-binding sites ( Site1 ) in the hlh-8 promoter ( Figs 10A and S5 )

. During our analysis of the mechanistic basis of the Susm phenotype of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants, we noticed that sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants exhibit significantly reduced levels of expression of the transgenic hlh-8 transcriptional reporter jjIs3900[hlh-8p::nls::mCherry] ( Figs 5 and S4 ). In wild-type animals, hlh-8p::nls::mCherry is expressed in the M mesoblast and all undifferentiated cells in the M lineage from the 1-M to 16-SM stage

. We reasoned that there might be additional SoxC-binding site ( s ) in the endogenous hlh-8 genomic region that contributes to the activation of hlh-8 expression in the absence of the two putative SoxC-binding sites in Site1 and Site2. Alternatively, hlh-8 expression in the later stages of M lineage development does not depend on SEM-2.

. In this study, we have found that the sem-2 ( P158S ) mutation, which renders the SEM-2 protein partially functional, can suppress the loss of M-CC phenotype of sma-9 ( 0 ) mutants ( Susm ), and that this Susm phenotype is dependent on the presence of LET-381 ( Tables 1 and 3, Fig 4 ). These findings support a role of SEM-2 in the dorsal side of the M lineage and a mutually repressive relationship between SEM-2 and LET-381 ( Fig 11A ). We therefore propose a model shown in Fig 11A

. Given that jj152, jj320, and jj321 mutants exhibit a weaker phenotype than sem-2 ( ok2422 ) null or trans-heterozygous mutants ( Tables 1–2 ), or animals that have undergone postembryonic sem-2 ( RNAi ) [6], we concluded that the SEM-2 ( P158S ) mutant protein exhibits a partial loss of SEM-2 function

. Sox4, one of the SoxC proteins in humans, is often amplified and overexpressed in multiple cancers, and Sox4 is known to play crucial roles in cancer development and progression, and has been classified as a “cancer signature” gene [16, 18]. In addition to regulating SM specification and proliferation, SEM-2 is essential for the proper differentiation of multiple non-striated muscle cells derived from the SM lineage

. We present genetic evidence showing that this single amino acid change results in a partial loss of SEM-2 function. By analyzing the M lineage phenotypes of jj152 mutants, we uncovered an unexpected role of SEM-2 in the dorsal M lineage, where SEM-2 functions antagonistically at the level of expression and function with LET-381 in CC specification

. In most sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants, the level of functional SEM-2 in the M lineage is sufficient to specify the SM fate ( 92%, N = 25 ) ( S2F–S2I” Fig ). However, the SMs in sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants exhibit reduced proliferation. These results provide direct evidence supporting a role of SEM-2 in regulating cell proliferation

. 1%, N = 52 ) ( S4K–S4L”’ Fig ). One possible reason why there is more robust expression of hlh-8p::nls::mCherry in sem-2 ( ok2422 ) null embryos than in sem-2 ( jj321[P158S] ) embryos is maternal contribution of SEM-2 in the sem-2 ( ok2422 ) null embryos by sem-2 ( ok2422 ) /hT2[qIs48] parents ( S4A–S4C and S4H–S4J Fig ). Further, these results suggest that SEM-2 is required for maintaining stable hlh-8 expression in the M lineage

. As previously suggested [45], such regulatory logic ensures temporal and spatial specificity of gene expression and robust cell fate specification. Previous studies have shown that SEM-2 specifies the multipotent and proliferative SM fate [6]. Since the SMs are not made in sem-2 ( P158 ) mutants, it is likely that SEM-2 is required for the diversification of the SM

Our results suggest that SEM-2 regulates hl-8 expression in the SM, and that SEM- is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM. We propose that SEM-2 is required for maintaining hl-8 expression in the lineage, at least in part, through direct regulation of hl-8 by SEM-2. Our results are consistent with SEM- playing an important role in regulating hl-8 in the SM, and that SEM- is required for the diversification of the SM.
