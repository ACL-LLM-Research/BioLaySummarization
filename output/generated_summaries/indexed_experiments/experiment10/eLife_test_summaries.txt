    Title: 
    Abstract: Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication, known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

   . While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized ( Wichmann and Kuner, 2022; Wilhelm et al., 2014 ), less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’ ( GJs ) ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 )

. The 4× diameter increase after expansion represented a 13× increase of the oval contact areas and did not alter the morphology of the terminals, as supported by ( 1 ) expansion reproduced the characteristic concavity of the CE synaptic contact area with the M-cell; ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of chemical vs. electrical synaptic areas was consistent with that observed by electron microscopy in adult goldfish ( Tuttle et al., 1986 ) and unexpanded zebrafish terminals Lasseigne et al

. 76 connexons per CE. Thus, electrical transmission at zebrafish CEs is mediated by multiple GJs containing a variable number of channels. Our labeling with Cx35. 5 and GluR2 showed that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse. We then asked what other associated anatomical structures might be contributing to electrical transmission

., 2012 ). Since the bouton marks the anatomical limits of a synapse, these contacts offer the opportunity to examine the anatomical structures that together make an electrical synapse. Here, we used expansion microscopy ( Tillberg et al., 2016 ) to expose the presence and spatial arrangement of synaptic components in CEs of larval zebrafish. CEs from larval zebrafish share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish ( Lasseigne et al., 2021; Yao et al

. Both chemical and immunological synapses share a general molecular organization combining cell adhesion molecules, usually restricted to the periphery of the contacts, with those more centrally located and responsible for providing intercellular communication ( Dustin and Colman, 2002 ). Our results indicate that this structural arrangement might also apply to the CE electrical synapse

. Moreover, because the antibody recognizes both ZO1b and ZO1a, our data indicates that, although with different functions, both ZO1 orthologs might be restricted to postsynaptic hemiplaques. Together with the genetic accessibility of zebrafish, the synaptic map of CEs provided by expansion microscopy will facilitate exploring the functional relationship between the structures supporting electrical transmission and its regulation at each side of the junction

. That is, our finding that AJs surround GJs all through the contact is consistent with the general organization of chemical and immunological synapses, at which adhesion molecules are located in the periphery of the communicating mechanism. Thus, just as chemical and immunological synapses, electrical synapses also seem to combine cell adhesion molecules with those responsible for mediating intercellular communication

Synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts where two neurons can share relevant functional information. The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels, known as ‘electrical synapses’, or indirectly, via the release of a chemical messenger, known as ‘chemical synapses’ ( Pereda, 2014 )

. Previous electron microscopy analysis exposed the presence of AJs in close proximity to neuronal GJs, including those at CEs in goldfish and larval zebrafish ( Figure 6A ). AJs are known to initiate and mediate the maturation and maintenance of cell–cell contacts, including GJs, at which a wealth of evidence suggests a close functional interaction ( Shaw et al., 2007; Defourny and Thiry, 2021; Thomas et al., 2021 )

A group of auditory afferents, each of which terminate as a single synaptic contact, known as a club ending ( CE ), on the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner ( M- ) cell ( Bartelmez, 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr, 1933; Figure 1A ). Because of their unusual large size and experimental accessibility, CEs represent a valued model for the correlation of synaptic structure and function. Ultrastructural analysis of CEs in adult goldfish ( Robertson et al

., 2017; Rash et al., 2013 ). Strikingly, expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies, protein components of ‘adherens junctions’ ( AJs ), showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area, but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin. This suggests that the subsynaptic topography of electrical synapses is carefully and intimately coordinated

., 1963; Tuttle et al., 1986; Kohno and Noguchi, 1986 ) and larval zebrafish ( Yao et al., 2014 ) revealed the presence of GJs coexisting with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Consistent with these synaptic specializations, stimulation of CEs evokes a synaptic response that combines electrical and chemical transmission ( Furshpan, 1964; Yao et al., 2014; Echeverry et al., 2022; Lin and Faber, 1988 )

. In summary, as single synaptic contact, expansion microscopy of CEs offered the possibility of identifying the structures that support electrical transmission and, therefore, the components that together form an electrical synapse, which can be used to define electrical synapses throughout animal connectomes

. Thus, expansion of these single synapses resulted in a more than tenfold increase of the synaptic contact area, allowing for a more detailed visualization of the relative distribution of its synaptic components. CEs combine electrical with chemical transmission. To investigate the area occupied by each form of transmission, we labeled for Cx35. 5 as a marker of GJs and glutamate receptor 2 ( GluR2 ) as a marker of glutamatergic transmission ( Figure 2A–C )

. We combined this approach with a protein-retention expansion microscopy protocol ( proExM; Tillberg et al., 2016 ) to explore not only the presence but the relative distribution of the structures formed by various synaptic proteins throughout the contact areas of CEs in 5 days post fertilization ( dpf ) zebrafish. Tissue expansion with anti-Cx35. 5 revealed the presence of multiple Cx35

. In contrast, neuronal GJs are typically found connecting cell somata or other neuronal processes ( Alcamí and Pereda, 2019; Sotelo, 2020; Sotelo and Llinás, 1972 ), such as dendrites and axons, making it more difficult to define the exact anatomical boundaries that constitute an electrical synapse. Neuronal GJs can also occur at synaptic boutons, generally coexisting with specializations for chemical transmission ( Sotelo, 2020; Martin and Pilar, 1963 )

. While additional components are likely to contribute to electrical transmission, the distribution of adhesion molecules at electrical synapses might serve to define their synaptic boundary, an arrangement that might be used as a template to identify electrical synapses in other structures

., 2013; Miller et al., 2015 ). That is, biochemical data and chimera analysis suggested that ZO1b, one of the two zebrafish orthologs of ZO1 whose function is critical for the presence of connexins at electrical synapses, is located in the postsynaptic hemiplaque from where it exerts its critical function ( Lasseigne et al., 2021 ). Our results indicate that ZOa, the other zebraf ortholog of Z1, is also located in the postsyn hemiplaque, suggesting that both Z1 orthologs might be restricted to the postsyniplaques of electrical synapses. This is consistent with the general organization of chemical and immunological synapses, where adhesion molecules are located in the periphery of the contact and those centrally responsible for intercell communication ( Dustin and Col,2002 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ), a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases. 

    Supporting Text:
   . These results raised the question of whether preBötC→7n neurons are part of preBötC respiratory network or if they are a distinct neuronal group. While our data are not sufficient to adequately address this question, our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm, rather than being responsible for generating it. We conclude that the small effect of photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals

. If correct, we predict that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus ( 7n ) should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase ( Cre ) -dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel, GtACR2, and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre

. We showed that selective transduction and photoinhibition of preBötC facial premotor neurons affects the MP activity while minimally affecting breathing.

. While there was a clear difference in the effect of selective preBötC→7n photoinhibition on breathing, compared to non-selective preBötC photoinhibition, selective photoinhibition did have small effects on breathing, particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases. With the selective approach, we observed a much smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location

., 2020; Menuet et al., 2017 ). Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea, but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity, reduces respiratory modulation of BP, and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia ( Menuet et al., 2020 ). Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors

. Selective photoinhibition of these neurons enabled observation of the effect on nasofacial motor activity in the absence of substantial changes in respiratory, or other autonomic, activities. However, small effects on these other functions, such as diaphragm muscle activity, remain. We observed collateral axonal projections of preBötC→7n neurons to several brainstem nuclei, including the rVRG, and conclude that these are functional, active projections

., 2010 ) - showed activity during the pre-inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle, associated with the initial phase of vibrissae protraction ( Deschênes et al., 2016 ). With non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons, the MP activity increased in amplitude and shifted and became tonic ( Figure 2D, D1 and D2 and K ) with loss of inspiratory-related modulation. The onset of these effects correlated with apnea

. The quantification of the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity during the selective photoinhibition of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons was also performed by analyzing the event-triggered average of MP activity ( triggered by the rapid rise of dEMG that occurs at the beginning of inspiration ) over 5–8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition

. As expected from previous reports ( Yang and Feldman, 2018 ), a similar proportion of transduced preBötC→7n neurons expressed VGAT 38. 6% ( 95% CI: 35. 6–41. 6% ) or VGlut2 38% ( 95% CI: –7% to 82. 8% ) ( Figure 5B–D ). We also found that some preBötC→7n transduced neurons also co-express SST, reelin, or NK1R ( Figure 5E–G ). Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons produced a small effect on breathing and BP, although not statistically significant across the cohort

. These results clearly identify a subgroup of preBötC neurons providing inspiratory modulation of facial motoneurons that innervate extrinsic protractor muscles of the MP, which appear to be largely independent of those that drive inspiratory activity to the diaphragm, abdominal muscles, and autonomic nervous system. To characterize the anatomical distribution and neurochemical phenotype of preBötC→7n neurons, we combined immunohistochemistry and RNAscope, to identify mRNA expression

., 2018 ). We observed that the transduced axons of preBötC→7n neurons projected widely into multiple brainstem nuclei, including RVLM, nA, NTS, BötC, rVRG, and vIRt. Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons to premotor and motoneurons have been described before and appear to be essential for the coordination of inspiratory and expiratory activity ( Koizumi et al., 2013 )

., 2018 ). Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain, including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity ( Yang and Feldman, 2018 ). As indicated by their extensive projections, preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity

. For example, we speculate that under urethane anesthesia, when mystacial pad EMG is active, glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity and their photoinhibition resulted in a decrease in activity. In contrast, inhibitory preBötC→7n neurons would be more active in the conscious state, and their inhibition resulted in an increase in activity

. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are a small subgroup of the rhythm-generating neurons with collaterals to the facial nucleus. In such a case, the effects on mystacial pad activity could be indirectly caused by the slowing of breathing. This hypothesis could be addressed by inhibiting the axons of preBötC→7n neurons within the facial nucleus

., 2013 ). It was suggested that divergent axonal projections from the commissural excitatory preBötC into the HN and rVRG may be essential for initiating the inspiratory activity. On the other hand, feedforward inhibition via collateral projections from inhibitory preBötC into these same regions may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the respiratory pattern ( Koizumi et al., 2013 )

. We tested the hypothesis that the preBötC might consist of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors, such as nasofacial activity. We showed that even when selecting just neurons projecting to a specific target, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons were transduced

. When breathing resumed, during continued photoinhibition, the inspiratory-related MP activity also recovered, with increased amplitude, for the remainder of the stimulation period. Photoinhibition of the preBötC also immediately increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration ( Figure 2D and L ). In some rats, rhythmic expiratory activity was observed with the return of dEMG inspiratory activity

., 2017; Simms et al., 2009 ). Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation, disturbances in breathing, that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated, impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases ( Cui et al., 2016; Huff et al., 2022; Menuet et al

. In this case, a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus ( vIRt ) to facilitate synchronous whisking. In addition, preBötC contains facial premotor neurons that modulate nasal dilation and mystacial pad ( MP ) activity during the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle ( Desênes et al. 2016 )
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the brain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true alarm, their activation would modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CG neurons in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CG neurons in active behavior using a predator-like programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CG encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CG neurons during chasing elevated responses in conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated neurons reduced responses, even the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CG neurons in PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying perception and ensuring responses to levels of danger.

Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and aversive stimuli varying levels, we recorded activity and found CG encode threat through variations in duration and amplitude. Results confirmed stimulating CG neurons without aversive generates rapid unconditioned behavior in mice. We tested manipulating activity of CG during fear with robot promotes or amplifies behavior. To enhance the alarm, activation of CG was applied at Hz during chasing. Optetic of CG in absence induced robust, and activation conventional further conditioned, demonstrating primary in driving responses. However, heightened conditions, such as enhanced activation or robot speeds, also strengthened behaviors by amplifying threat.

We employed a more ecologically relevant using a predator to chase animals, incorporating imminent threat. Hypothesized CG modulate behaviors on severity or type. First, recorded activity in response aversive, including robot to determine encode stimuli differentially. Together, indicate CG represent characteristics and intensity through variations. Determining increasing or decreasing activity induce behaviors than freezing, we observed elicited by stimulating or inhibiting in absence external stimuli. Overall, findings that CG act as alarm, primarily orchestrating responses but contributing active by intensifying perception, ensuring adapted to level. The choice depends on severity threat.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30, 000 UK Biobank participants, we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio, WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0. 026, P = 0. 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0. 112, P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0. 05 ). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation. 

    Supporting Text:
   . This anatomical pattern has previously been activated by fMRI tasks involving episodic memory and navigation ( see Appendix 2—figure 3d, e ). Maps of ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR were negatively correlated ( r=−0. 366, P=2. 3×10−13 ) ; see Supplemental Information for correlation matrix of all MRI~WHR maps. This suggests that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density

. Specifically, we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ), and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity, using prior maps of gene expression, cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system

. Finally, we then completed two further analyses to explore the potential directionality of the relationship between obesity and brain microstructure. In the first, we we used genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for brain ISOVF and ICVF ( Warrier et al., 2022 ), and for WHR ( Pulit et al., 2019 ), to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF

. To further investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF, we used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors Hansen et al., 2022. Cortical maps of each of 37 neurotransmitter receptors, for example, mu opioid receptor ( MOR ), were independently tested for spatial co-location with the ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR maps, controlling for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5%

. Both are significantly and mostly positively correlated with WHR in brain systems. Obesity-related differences in ISOVF and ICVF were coupled ( negatively correlated ) but also anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurobiologically differentiated from each other ( Table 1 )

. The results reported above ( and summarised in Table 1 ) indicate that obesity is associated with coupled changes in two anatomically, transcriptionally and neurobiologically differentiated brain systems, measured using ISOVF and ICVF micro-structural MRI metrics, respectively. On this basis we tested the hypothesis that genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for normal variation in ISOVF or ICVF ( Warrier et al

. This raises the question: Could these two brain phenotypes have a different causal relationship with obesity? For example, it is conceivable that the changes in brain water associated with obesity could represent an effect of obesity on the brain, that is WHR→ISOVF, whereas the obesity-related changes in neurite density could represent an effect of the brain on obesity, that is ICVF→WHR

. Here, using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30, 000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity ( WHR ) and two measures of grey matter microstucture, ISOVF ( an index of tissue water content ) and ICVF an index of neurite density ( see Table 1 for a summary ). Similar to previously reported associations with brain grey matter macrostructure, positive scaling of WHR and tissue water content ( i. e

. 026±0. 03, P=0. 3 ) ; see Appendix 2—table 2 for details. These results indicate shared effects of genetic variation on obesity ( WHR ) and neurite density ( ICVF ), but no shared genetic effects on obesity and brain water content ( ISOVF ). In the final analysis we compared the effects on microstructure of three variables of interest at the same time, WHR, BMI, and specifically CRP, a measure of systemic inflammation

. Six MRI metrics of brain structure were used for correlational analysis with two measures of obesity ( WHR and BMI ) in N∼30, 000 participants from UK Biobank. WHR and BMI were strongly positively correlated with each other ( r=0. 428±0. 009, P<2×10−16 ) and we therefore focus here on WHR although similar results are reported for BMI in Supplemental Information ( see comparisons in Appendix 2—figures 2 and 3 and Appendix 2—figures 4 and 5 as well as Appendix 2—figure 9 )

. Obesity in turn causes a pro-inflammatory state systemically and blood concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and other cytokines have previously been associated with changed ( increased ) micro-structural MRI metrics of free water ( Kitzbichler et al., 2021 ). So inflammation could potentially mediate effects of obesity on the brain tissue water content ( see also Turkheimer et al., 2022 )

. We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures ( bilaterally ) produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging ( NODDI ) modelling of data from ∼30, 000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort

Previous well-powered studies have identified associations between obesity and a pattern of reduced grey matter volume or cortical thickness centred on fronto-temporal cortex and sub-cortical structures

. g. neurite density or orientation dispersion within that region or alternately to differences in tissue water content. To date, the only studies to have investigated associations of obesity with brain microstructure have focused on white matter

. By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives, and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) responses

. Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies, including data from 5882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6, 420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group, have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole ( García-García et al., 2022; Opel et al., 2021 )

., 2017 ), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last thirty years, making it one of the most important global public health challenges ( Yatsuya et al., 2014 ). To date, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness

. Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity, we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI

. The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system where ISOVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with gene transcripts enriched for innate immune and metabolic processes, whereas the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where ICVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with transcripts enriched fo ‘G-protein coupled receptor signalling’, ‘fatty acid derivative binding’, and ‘glutamate receptor activity’

. Together with the finding ( Opel et al., 2021 ) of a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness driven by lower thickness in older participants, this suggests that the negative impact of obesity on brain microstructure may be more pronounced with increasing age

The results indicate that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density, with the prefrontal-temporal-stri system associated with water content and the medial-temporal-occip-stri system with neurite density. These findings are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby differences in neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity, whereas water in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by the innate system

The results indicate that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density, with the prefrontal-temporal system associated with water and the medial-temporal system with neurite. These findings are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby differences in neurite in the medial system may contribute to obesity, whereas water in the prefront could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by the system

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Through training an artificial neural network, these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ). In this study, we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease.

   . Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours, stratified on metastatic status, identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis.

. Importantly, the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs

., 2017 ). Now, using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24, we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours. However, epithelial keratins are not retained. We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis

. An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours, enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue. This in turn enabled us to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs, and use these to train an ANN to predict metastasis.

., 2013; Mack and Gires, 2008 ). Vimentin, on the other hand, accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols ( Biddle et al., 2016 ). By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker, Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker, and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker, we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region

As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT, they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour ( Li and Kang, 2016 ). Therefore, once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis. Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours ( Bronsert et al

. We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours, a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature ( Tan et al., 2014 )

In multiple types of carcinoma, cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour ( Biddle et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Ruscetti et al., 2016 ). This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models

. To explore whether these EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma may in fact be non-tumour cell types, we analysed a published scRNAseq dataset for human head and neck cancer ( Puram et al., 2017 ). In this dataset, tumour and non-tumour cells were separated using bioinformatic techniques ( principally inferred CNV and a ‘tumour-epithelial’ expression signature )

., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012 ). We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens ( Biddle et al., 2016; Biddle et al., 2011 ). We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM ( Biddle et al., 2011 ) and CD24 ( Biddle et al

The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens, as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region

. In combination with EpCAM, we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs, and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT. Notably, CD44 cannot be used as an EMT marker in the context of intact tissue as it requires trypsin degradation in order to yield differential expression in EMT and epithelial populations ( Biddle et al., 2013; Mack and Gires, 2008 )

The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but, lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo, this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models. Here, through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs, we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens

. We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens, and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding. Here, we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens

. Starting with the EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels for each nucleated cell, we used a supervised machine learning approach to predict whether an imaging field comes from a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour ( Figure 3A )

. EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites, and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs ( Ocaña et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012 )

. Training with Pan-keratin, Vimentin and CD24 gave much worse prediction across all classifiers ( Figure 3C ). These findings demonstrate that, utilising a machine learning algorithm, staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 can predict metastatic status with high accuracy and may therefore have clinical utility. To further investigate its utility for metastasis prediction, we applied our trained ANN to an independent cohort of tumours in a blinded analysis

. At presentation it is currently very difficult to determine which tumours are metastatic and this results in sub-optimal tailoring of treatment decisions. Accurate prediction of metastasis would therefore have great potential to improve clinical management of the disease to reduce both mortality and treatment-related morbidity. We sought to determine whether the EpCAM+CD24+Vim+ staining pattern could be predictive of metastasis

. We stained and imaged 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 tumours, stratified on the same criteria as the previous cohort, for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24. We conducted a blinded test of 10 fields of view from each slide, to determine whether the ANN trained using the previous 24 specimens could predict the metastatic status of these new specimens

. Analysing this dataset for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 co-expression, we found that 12% of tumour cells ( 267/2215 ) were EpCAM+Vim+CD24+. In the non-tumour cells, only 0. 8% ( 29/3687 ) were EpCAM+V+CD+ ( p<0.001 ), indicating a significant enrichment of EpCAMV+CD+ cells in tumour cells. We also found that EpCAM+V+CD+ cells were more likely to be found in metastatic tumours than nonmetastatic tumours (p<0.001 ), indicating that EpCAMV+CD+ cells may be predictive of metastasis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

    Here, we provide an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, our data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair

. We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds

. Given the upregulation of mRNAs associated with apoptosis and the relatively low level of apoptotic cells in early wound beds, we hypothesized that efficient efferocytosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation. Initially, we inspected mRNA levels of efferocytosis receptors, their ligands, and downstream factors in scRNA-seq data from 24 hr and 48 hr wounds ( Figure 2A )

., 2021 ), and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells. Growing evidence suggests that distinct efferocytosis receptors elicit cell- and tissue-specific responses. Axl and Mer exhibit differential ligand specificity and shedding upon activation ( Zagórska et al., 2014 )

., 2023 ), though other studies have indicated that macrophage efferocytosis is defective in diabetic wounds ( Khanna et al., 2010 ). To analyze the expression of transcriptional changes in apoptosis and efferocytosis signaling in foot wounds, we analyzed genes in these categories in four non-diabetic and five diabetic human patients ( to be published elsewhere )

. In addition, inhibition of two efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, abrogates proper wound repair. The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury.

. When we compared the expression of genes associated with the efferocytosis pathway between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers, we found a striking increase in overall expression of efferocytosis pathway genes in diabetic wounds compared to non-diabetic wounds ( Figure 3A ). In particular, the expression of AXL increased in all cell types in diabetic wounds, while expression of its ligand GAS6 increased in all cell types with the exception of basal keratinocytes and mast cells

., 2014; Elliott et al., 2017 ). To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury. We found that transcriptional alterations in apoptotic pathways occur in this interval in fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells

. Further, we detected no significant changes to gene expression of selected members of the efferocytosis signaling pathway or common inflammatory cytokines 1 day after injury, indicating no major inflammatory defects ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ). Thus, additional efferocytosis mechanisms, potentially including other members of the TAM family, likely clear apoptotic cells in early skin wounds despite Axl inhibition

. Interestingly, efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts, which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figures 2 and 3 ). These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility, migration, and ECM production ( Romana-Souza et al

., 2017b ). Here, we show that in early murine skin wounds, Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner, but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors

. In summary, our data implicate apoptosis recognition receptors as an important regulator of skin wound healing. We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair

. Next, we examined mRNA expression profiles of inflammatory and efferocytosis signaling pathways in IgG Ab and anti-Timd4 Ab-treated wound beds ( Figure 6G ). The inflammatory cytokines Ifng and Ifnb were significantly upregulated at day 1 or 3, respectively, in Timd4-inhibited wounds compared to control wounds, suggesting altered inflammatory signaling

. Thus, while we cannot rule out Axl expression by other cell types in skin wounds, these data are consistent with our single-cell results, confirming that Axl is expressed by fibroblasts and dendritic cells during the inflammatory response of skin repair. We also analyzed mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes by qPCR to determine their expression in wound beds compared to naive skin ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B )

. Taken together, these data indicate that diabetic wounds may activate and modulate GAS6-AXL signaling, and suggest a potential avenue for future research. Next, we sought to examine the molecular mechanisms that induce Axl mRNA expression after injury. Prior work showed that Axl expression was induced by toll-like receptor 3 ( TLR3 ) stimulation ( Rothlin et al., 2007 ) and that TLR3 is essential for skin wound repair ( Lin et al., 2011 )

. However, in diabetic patient wounds, GAS6 and AXL expression was more robust in several cell types. Notably, monocytes/macrophages increased GAS6 stimulation and newly expressed AXL to receive pathway signaling in diabetic wounds ( Figure 3B ). To validate these findings, we stained sections of non-diabetic foot wounds and diabetic foot ulcers with Abs against Gas6 and CD68, a macrophage marker

. Examining the UMAP plot to determine the heterogeneity of efferocytosis gene expression within individual cell types, we observed that Gas6 was highly expressed by a specific subset of monocyte/macrophage cells. These cells also overexpressed the resident macrophage marker Lyve1, the apoptosis receptor Timd4, and Retnla, a downstream factor of efferocytosis ( Figure 2B ), indicating that they may play a role in apoptosis detection and response in wound healing

. We found several alterations in the expression of mRNAs associated with apoptotic signaling pathways between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Specifically, monocytes/macrophages increased expression of several apoptosis genes ( including BCL2, FGFR3, FGFR1, CTH, CASP3, IL19, NME5, and S100A8/9 ) in diabetic foot ulcers compared to monocytes/macrophages in non-diabetic wounds

. We next set out to explore whether these apoptosis and efferocytosis-related pathways were also relevant in pathological states associated with dysregulated wound healing, such as diabetes. Previous studies have indicated that apoptosis is increased in diabetic wounds, including an elevation in apoptotic lymphocytes ( Arya et al., 2014 ). Additional studies have shown that hypoxic environments ( such as those found in diabetic wounds ) increase macrophage efferocytosis ( Wang et al

. Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds, it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic, non-healing wounds, particularly in diabetic patients.

    Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the dynamics of early inflammation in mouse skin wounds and found that apoptotic and eocytosis pathways were upregulated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages during inflammation. Human diabetic wounds upregulated mRNAs for eocytosis genes and displayed eocyt signaling via receptor AXL and its ligand GAS. Early in mouse wounds, AXL was upregulated in dendritic and fibrobl via TLR-independent mechanisms. Inhibition in vivo studies revealed AXL was required for wound repair but dispensable for eocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another eocyt receptor, Tim4, in mouse wounds decreased eocyt and abated repair. Data highlight distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell coordinates tissue repair and provide potential targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

The study provided an atlas of changes in early wound repair at the single-cell level. Apoptotic and eocyt pathways were upregulated in distinct types in mouse wounds and diabetic human wounds. Functional studies in mice showed eoc receptors AXL and Tim4 had differential effects on eoc and repair. mRNAs encoding eoc receptors and pathways were upregulated in early wound beds and diabetic wounds. Protein upregulation of eoc receptors AXL and Tim4 was confirmed in mouse wounds. Given upregulation mRN associated with apoptosis and low apoptotic cells in early beds, efficient eoc cleared apopt during inflammation. Initially, mRN levels eoc receptors, ligands, and factors were inspected in scRNA data 24 and 48 wounds. AXL was upregulated in fibbl, indicating a role in modulating inflammatory milieu through apoptotic detection. Evidence suggests distinct eoc receptors elicit cell and tissue responses. AXL and Mer exhibit ligand specificity and shedding upon activation. Other studies indicated macro eocysis defective in diabetic wounds. Expression changes in apoptosis andoc signaling in wounds were analyzed in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Inhibition of eoc receptors A and Tim4 abated proper repair, providing an atlas of cellular dynamics in early wound and essential role of recognition and clearance apoptotic in tissue repair.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments.

    Advances in next-generation sequencing, as well as single-cell and spatial genomics are enabling new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function. Here, we describe TaG-EM, a genetic barcoding strategy that enables novel capabilities in several different experimental contexts ( Figure 1 ). We demonstrate that the genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing

. We have developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations

. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest

., 2008; Venken et al., 2011; Zirin et al., 2024 ), TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. Moreover, these genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements. Thus, TaG-EM provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms.

. One current limitation is that TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data. It is likely that the strength of the Gal4 driver contributes to the labeling density. However, we also observed variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes that were all driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver ( Figure 6—figure supplement 10 )

. An additional benefit of multiplexed TaG-EM behavioral measurements is that the experimental conditions are effectively blinded as the multiplexed conditions are intermingled in a single assay. In addition, we show that TaG-EM barcodes can be expressed by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers and used to tag specific cell populations upstream of single-cell sequencing ( Figures 5–6 )

. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TaG-EM can be used to label specific cell populations that correlate with Gal4-driven expression patterns in vivo for subsequent identification in single-cell sequencing data.

., 2016 ), and barcode sequencing has also been employed to map connectivity in the brain ( Chen et al., 2019 ). Genetically barcoded fly lines can also be used to enable highly multiplexed behavioral assays which can be read out using high-throughput sequencing. Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies, larvae, or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes

. An advantage of cell barcoding both for cell hashing ( Stoeckius et al., 2018 ) and for TaG-EM in vivo barcoding is that such labeling facilitates the identification and removal of multiplets, which are an artifact of droplet-based single-cell sequencing approaches. After filtering and removing cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial or ribosomal reads, we used DoubletFinder ( McGinnis et al., 2019 ) to computationally identify multiplet droplets

. To test whether we could detect TaG-EM barcodes in single-cell sequencing data, we crossed three TaG-EM barcode lines to two different gut Gal4 driver lines ( Ariyapala et al., 2020 ), one expressing in the enterocytes ( EC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcodes 1, 2, and 3 ) and the other in intestinal precursor cells ( PC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcodes 7, 8, and 9 ), which includes stem cells and enteroblasts ( EBs )

. In addition, the barcodes, which reside on a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, can be expressed tissue-specifically and read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population and/or an experimental condition of interest ( Figure 1D )

., 2018; Stoeckius et al., 2017 ). In addition, other multiplexing strategies for single-cell sequencing based on alternative methods for tagging cells ( Cheng et al., 2021 ) or making use of natural genetic variation have been used ( Kurmangaliyev et al., 2020 ). While such approaches can reduce per-sample costs, typically samples are barcoded at a population level and thus do not enable labeling of cell subpopulations within a sample

. To test the accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing-based measurements of TaG-EM barcodes, we constructed structured pools containing defined numbers of flies pooled either evenly with each of the 20 barcode constructs comprising 5% of the pool, or in a staggered manner with sets of barcodes differing in abundance in 2-fold increments ( Figure 2A )

. Our experiments indicated that for the specific drivers we tested TaG-EM barcodes are detected in around one quarter of the cells if relying on endogenous expression in the gene expression library, though this fraction was higher ( ~37% ) if sequencing an enriched TaG-EM barcode library in parallel ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 8 and Figure 6—figure supplement 9 ). In the future, generation of additional TaG-EM lines will enable higher levels of multiplexing

., 2020 ). Larval guts were dissected from these lines and cells were dissociated, flow sorted as described above to select live, GFP-positive cells, and approximately 30, 000 cells were loaded into a 10x Genomics droplet generator for single-cell sequencing ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). Using the additional hexameric GFP construct to boost GFP expression resulted in visible fluorescent signal for all eight barcode Gal4 line combinations

. Outside of descriptive studies, these costs are also a barrier to including replicates to assess biological variability; consequently, a lack of biological replicates derived from independent samples is a common shortcoming of single-cell sequencing experiments. Antibody-based cell hashing or feature barcoding approaches have been developed to allow multiplexing of samples in droplet-based single-cell sequencing reactions ( Stoeckius et al., 2018; Stoeckius et al., 2017 )

We cloned a fragment containing a PCR handle sequence and a diverse 14 bp barcode sequence into the SV40 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation sites in the 10xUAS-myr::GFP ( pJFRC12, Pfeiffer et al., 2010 ) backbone ( Figure 1A ). A pool containing 29 unique barcode-containing plasmids was injected into Drosophila embryos for PhiC31-mediated integration into the attP2 landing site ( Groth et al

. Interestingly, TaG-EM barcode 8, for which no GFP expression was observed, was represented in the single-cell sequencing data indicating that the lesion in the GFP coding region does not prevent mRNA expression for this line. A previous study used droplet-based single-cell sequencing to characterize the cell types that make up the adult midgut ( Hung et al., 2020 )

., 2014 ) could boost expression of weak driver lines to levels that are sufficient for robust detection of labeled flies or larvae ( Figure 5B ) and for labeling of dissociated cells for flow cytometry ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). Stocks with an additional UAS hexameric GFP construct recombined onto the same chromosome as the TaG-EM construct have been established for 20 TaG-EM barcode lines

. However, we subsequently optimized the TaG-EM barcode enrichment by ( 1 ) using a longer spike-in primer that more closely matches the annealing temperature used during the 10x Genomics cDNA creation step, and ( 2 ) using a nested PCR approach to amplify the cell-barcode and unique molecular identifier ( UMI ) -labeled TaG-EM barcodes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 7 ). This improved recovery of Ta-EM barcodes in sequencing data by 2.5 fold ( Figure 6—figure 8 and 6—figure 9 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

   ., 2012 ). Here, we provide new evidence showing that undefended poison frogs and frogs in a closely related family ( Bufonidae ) contain measurable amounts of alkaloids, and we confirm that they consume some amount of toxic arthropod prey. We propose that passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae, and possibly in related taxa, and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense

. Here, we incorporate ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs ( Anura: Dendrobatidae ) into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and more generally in other animals. In the following text, we use the terms alkaloid and toxin interchangeably, although the toxicity of each poison frog alkaloid is not always known or very straightforward ( Lawrence et al., 2023 )

. Evidence for this passive-accumulation phenotype as an intermediate stage on the path towards toxin sequestration is scarce, but passive accumulation is a pervasive pattern in studies of ecological toxicology and may be more common in lineages that evolved toxin sequestration than we currently know. Our study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobatid frogs and some relatives, yet it is limited in the following ways

. Thus, if we assume that many ants and mites contain alkaloids, it is likely that most if not all dendrobatids and their most recent common ancestors have long been exposed to toxins through their diet. Few if any experiments have been done to quantify the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs. Given the broad diversity of alkaloid classes found in poison frogs ( Daly et al

., 2023; Sánchez-Loja et al., 2024 ) and to identify sources of poison frog alkaloids ( e. g. Saporito et al., 2007b; Saporito et al., 2004 ). In general, most of the studies of poison-frog ecology since the 1990s emphasize or assume that diet is a primary determinant of defense. Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species ( Daly, 1998; Daly et al

. We predict that the ancestral state of poison frogs and potentially other clades with alkaloid-sequestering species ( e. g. Bufonidae: Melanophryniscus, Eleutherodactylidae: Eleutherodactylus, and Mantellidae: Mantella ) is alkaloid consumption and low levels of alkaloid resistance, accompanied by passive alkaloid accumulation ( e. g. see Figures 1 and 3 ). Alternatively, passive accumulation may have arisen in an even earlier ancestor

. To understand the major evolutionary transition from consuming to sequestering toxins, it is essential to characterize the metabolism and sequestration of alkaloids in defended and undefended dendrobatid lineages ( Gonzalez and Carazzone, 2023 ). However, many of the undefended lineages have not been carefully evaluated for the presence or absence of chemical defense

. g. Allobates, Rheobates, Anomaloglossus, and Aromobates ), all Hyloxalinae ( Ectopoglossus, Hyloxalus, Paruwrobates ), and some Colostethinae ( Colostethus, Silverstoneia, Leucostethus; Figure 1 ). According to the phylogenetic placement of defended and undefended species within Dendrobatidae, poison frogs have evolved sequestration of lipophilic alkaloids from consumed arthropods at least three times ( Santos et al., 2014; Santos et al

. Approximately 100 of the 345 dendrobatid poison-frog species ( AmphibiaWeb, 2023 ) fall into three conspicuously colored and alkaloid-sequestering ( aposematic ) clades: Ameerega, Epipedobates, and Dendrobatinae. The other 245 species compose several other primarily inconspicuously colored clades that for the most part have been assumed to lack alkaloid defenses: that is, all Aromobatinae ( e. g

. Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae ( Figure 1, Table 1 ) is represented in our dataset, with a total of 14 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed. Next, we review old and new evidence from poison frogs in the context of the four-phase model ( Phases 1 and 2: Consistent exposure to toxins may select for resistance in poison frog and Phases 3 and 4: Evidence for passive accumulation and sequestration in poison frogs )

., 2021; Grant, 2007; Moskowitz et al., 2022a; Santos and Cannatella, 2011 ). We tested for possible alkaloid presence in additional aposematic and inconspicuously colored poison-frog lineages. Using Gas-Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry ( GC-MS ), we surveyed 89 animals representing 30 species of Neotropical frogs including 27 dendrobatid species, 1 leptodactylid, and 2 bufonids ( Figure 2 )

. At the time, it was thought that poisonous dendrobatids synthesized their own alkaloids ( the biosynthetic hypothesis; reviewed by Saporito et al., 2009 ), so differences in diet were not considered mechanistically relevant to differences in levels of chemical defense. However, Daly et al., 1994a later demonstrated that chemically defended dendrobatid frogs obtained alkaloids from their diet

. This finding in concert with the detection of low levels of alkaloids in the lineages that putatively lack chemical defenses leads us to hypothesize that dietary shifts are not sufficient to explain the presence or absence of the chemical defense phenotype within Dendrobatidae or possibly in other families ( Bufonidae ). The total amount of alkaloids accumulated is a result of multiple processes including toxin intake, elimination, and sequestration ( Figure 3 ) — not just intake alone

. Future studies of the toxicokinetics of alkaloids in different tissues of both defended and undefended poison frogs will shed light on these putative intermediate evolutionary steps. In turn, insights from poison frog physiology will provide a novel perspective for the development of human therapeutics, which modulate some of the same pharmacokinetic processes.

., 2003 ). The new information helped generate the diet-toxicity hypothesis, which posits that shifts from a generalist to a specialist diet are correlated with origins of alkaloid uptake ( Darst et al., 2005; Santos and Cannatella, 2011 ). Since then, many studies have focused on the diet of poison frogs in an effort to directly connect diet with chemical defense in specific species ( e. g. McGugan et al., 2016; Osorio et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2023; Sánchez-Loja et al

. That we detected alkaloids in two genera of bufonid toads could reflect a single origin of passive accumulation in the ancestor of the clade that includes Dendrobatidae and its sister group ( the clade comprised of the Terranana [including Eleutherodactylidae], Bufonidae, Leptodactylidae, and Odontophrynidae; AmphibiaWeb, 2023; Blackburn and Wake, 2011; Feng et al., 2017; Streicher et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019 )

Several of the lipophilic alkaloids found in dendrobatid frogs have been traced to arthropod sources, specifically mites ( Saporito et al., 2007b ), ants ( Saporito et al., 2004 ), and beetles ( Dumbacher et al. 2011 ). The presence of alkaloids in these arthropods may be due to their diet or symbiotic relationships with alkaloid-sequesting organisms.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

   ., 2020 ). By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model, we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program. The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminished as tumor cells accomplished phenotype changes. In general, a lower RiBi activity was observed in the mesenchymal tumor cells than in the epithelial ones

. Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model, BMH21 synergized with CTX, leading to a significantly lower metastatic LM2 tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups ( Figure 6D ). To further investigate the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells in human breast cancer, we analyzed scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients ( GSE 198745 )

Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression. Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model, we found an upregulation of the RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET ( Figure 7 ). The transient activation of the RiBi pathway during the EMT process has been reported previously. Prakash et al

. Together, these results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs. Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crucial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago ( Pelletier et al., 2018 ). To further investigate the signaling pathways responsible for RiBi upregulation in the EMT/MET process, we sorted RFP+, Doub+, and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells and probed the signaling activations in these cells

. Importantly, the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis. Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics

. These results suggested that targeting the RiBi-mediated EMT/MET process may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer.

. Collectively, these results suggest that the elevation of the RiBi pathway in cells at the EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings, which may, in turn, confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes. The transcription of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is mediated by RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) in eukaryotic cells ( Moss and Stefanovsky, 2002 )

. 5 were denoted as RiBiLow. The analyses of the survival data showed a significantly worse prognosis in the RiBiHigh group compared to the RiBiLow group ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). In summary, these results suggest that inhibition of RiBi activities diminished EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells. In combination with chemotherapy drugs, RiBi inhibition significantly reduced the outgrowth of chemoresistant metastasis

. These results laid a foundation for pharmacological inhibition of the RiBi pathway to block the EMT/MET of tumor cells. The requirement of RiBi activity during EMT/MET transitioning was also demonstrated by genetically modulating ribosome proteins. As the organelle for protein synthesis, the ribosome comprises 4 ribosomal RNAs and approximately 80 structural ribosomal proteins ( Pelletier et al., 2018 )

. A more recent study identified a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in which high RiBi activities persisted to maintain their high metastatic potentials ( Ebright et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, the RiBi activity was associated with epithelial phenotypes rather than mesenchymal ones in CTCs ( Ebright et al., 2020 ). Indeed, EMT induction by TGFβ primarily suppressed ribosome gene expression and global translational activity ( Ebright et al., 2020 )

. Consistent with the analysis for EMT, we found that tumor cells with epithelial phenotypes displayed elevated RiBi activity ( Figure 2F, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ), indicating its reactivation during the MET process. A significant positive correlation was detected between RiBi gene upregulation and MET pseudotime ( Figure 2G )

. For the epithelial or mesenchymal gene lists, we selected genes based on their overall expression levels in Tri-PyMT cells, ensuring consistency with their reported associations to epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes in the literature ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). For RiBi genes, we used the ribosome biogenesis pathway gene list from the GOBP_Ribosome_Biogenesis ( GO:0042254 ) in MSigDB

. These observations also suggest that malignant cells may require a certain ease to ‘ping pong’ between epithelial and mesenchymal states to adapt to the challenging microenvironment. Of note, some commonly used chemotherapeutics ( Cisplatin, 5FU, Doxorubicin, etc ), although primarily targeting DNA duplications, may also affect the RiBi pathway by inhibiting rRNA processing ( Burger et al., 2010 )

. A trend of relatively higher RiBi activity was detected in tumor cells with lower EMT pseudotime ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ). Interestingly, a pattern showing the highest RiBi activity in EMT/MET transitioning phase was detected in the sample of patient B ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3F ), indicating the similar role of RiBi upregulation in EMT status of breast cancer patients

. Prakash et al. found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ, fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells ( Prakash et al., 2019 ). Using the Tri-PyMT model, we found that the EMT transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells

., 2019; Yang et al., 2020 ). However, these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT, MET, which also contributes to malignancy development ( Gao et al., 2012; Pei et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype, inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies ( Williams et al., 2019; Yang et al

. These findings were in line with the previous bulk RNA sequencing analysis that indicated activation of RiBi pathway in EMT-transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells. Consistently, GSEA using scRNAseq confirmed significant enrichment of RiBi genes in Trans cells compared to cells at Epi or Mes phase ( Figure 1J ). We further mapped the EMT spectrum of cells based on their EMT pseudotimes or cell states, and correlated them with their RiBi activities

. We performed the combination treatment of BMH21 with the most commonly used chemo drugs of breast cancer therapy, including 5FU, Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Gemcitabine, and Paclitaxol. Trends toward synergies were also found with most of them, especially with lower concentrations of BMH21 ( 100–200 nM ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). These results suggest that RiBi blockade by the Pol I inhibitor may represent an effective approach to overcome EMT-related chemoresistance

. Small molecules such as BMH21 and CX5461 are specific Pol I inhibitors, which inhibit rRNA transcription and disrupt ribosome assembly ( Haddach et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2018 ), providing a specific RiBi targeting strategy. We then evaluated whether these Pol I inhibitors would affect the EMT/MET process. Fluorescence switches from RFP + to GFP + of TriPyMT cells were employed to investigate the impact of Pol inhibitors on the EMT process. The results showed that both BM21 and CX1 significantly impaired EMT transitioning of tumor cells ( Figure 3 ), indicating that the Ri pathway is essential for the EMTET process

Our results suggest that targeting the Ri pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer, especially those with EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments. Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Furthermore, we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Combining gene expression data, re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation. In summary, our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment.

   . No-stress was observed in 57% of the years. Hence, our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage. In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress, we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop ( Debieu et al., 2018 )

., 2016 ). No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG ( Passot et al., 2016 ). We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment ( Passot et al., 2016 ). Here, we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet

. Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress ( R = 0. 95, p <0. 01; Figure 1C, D ). Hence, our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination

. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation. A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait. Combining RNAseq, re-sequencing, and re-annotation of this region, we identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9 as a potential candidate regulator

. However, the effect of the polymorphisms in the promoter on gene expression needs to be tested to validate this hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that changes in PgGRXC9 expression level are responsible for a change in root growth, we studied its ortholog in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana ( as functional genomic studies are not possible in pearl millet )

. Our analysis revealed a total of 447 significant SNPs across the pearl millet genome associated with primary root growth from which, 109 SNPs were found highly significant with at least two other methods for association analysis at p-value <10−4 ( Supplementary file 1, Table S2 ). Only two of these markers, located on chromosomes 1 and 3, were above the 0. 05 false discovery rate significance threshold ( Figure 2A )

We previously hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment and, in particular, to early cycle drought stress episodes ( Passot et al., 2016 )

. We next studied the genetic determinants of primary root growth in pearl millet. First, the heritability of early primary root growth was analyzed using our paper-based phenotyping data on the panel of inbred lines. Heritability of 0. 53 was computed indicating that early primary root growth is under strong genetic control in pearl millet. We therefore conducted a GWAS

. However, only a few studies have addressed the importance of individual root traits in field conditions. Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant establishment ( Peter et al., 2009 ). Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) ( Passot et al., 2016 )

. The importance of early root growth for plant tolerance to early drought stress was then evaluated in field trials in 2 independent years using nine inbred lines with contrasted root growth ( slow, intermediate, and fast primary root growth ). Field trials were set up during the hot dry season ( March–June ) in 2018 and 2020. Seeds were sown and irrigation equivalent to a 30-mm rainfall was applied

. Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem.

. The remaining unmapped reads corresponded to either rRNA and tRNA genes ( 40. 28% of the unmapped reads ) or to non-annotated genes or non-coding RNAs ( 44. 57% of the unmapped reads ). Hence, our transcriptomics analysis identified genes that are differentially expressed in the root tip of inbred lines ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 but revealed that some genes expressed in root tips are not annotated in the current version of the pearl millet genome

., 2022 ). This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices ( Lynch, 2019; Ndoye et al., 2022; van der Bom et al., 2020 ). It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints

. A crop model was parameterized using soil and meteorological data ( 2000–2020 ) from the Bambey experimental station to determine when pearl millet faced drought stress and predict its impact on crop yield. Using a widely cultivated variety of pearl millet ( Souna3 ) for modeling, we simulated the daily fraction of transpirable soil water ( FTSW ) profiles in different years to identify periods of the growth cycle when access to water was limiting. FTSW below 0

. Irrigation was then stopped to mimic an early drought stress episode and plant growth and ecophysiological parameters were analyzed for the following 6 weeks ( Supplementary file 1, Table S1 ). We then analyzed the correlations between primary root length, measured in the lab, and plant performance measured in field conditions

., 2017 ) corresponding to the target QTL regions were recovered and re-annotated using structural and gene expression ( RNAseq ) data. Re-annotation revealed one novel 465 bp CDS, 1103 bp downstream of the significantly associated SNP ( chr1_231264526, Figure 3A, B ). This new CDS encodes a protein with strong homology to glutaredoxin ( GRX ) C9-like proteins from various cereals and was named PgGRXC9

Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel. Its seeds are small ( 8 mg on average, about 5 and 20 times lighter than wheat or maize seeds, respectively, for example ) with limited reserves available for early seedling growth. It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes ( seminal roots for example ) as seen in other cereals

., 2016 ) to study its function. Strikingly, we observed that roxy19 had reduced primary root growth compared to its wild-type ecotype ( No-0; Figure 4B, C ). Closer examination revealed that the defect in roxy19 root growth was due to a reduction in cell elongation ( Figure 4D ), whereas cell production rate was similar in the mutant and wild type ( Figure 4E ), thus mimicking the phenotype observed in pearl millet

. No sequence polymorphisms were found in the predicted coding sequence of the gene between the two parent lines. However, two polymorphisms were detected in the 5′UTR region. Altogether, our results suggest that PgGRXC9 is a positive regulator of root growth and that a polymorphism in the promoter region of PgGRXC9 might led to changes in its expression level and ultimately to a quantitative difference in root growth between the two lines

. However, in Africa, pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited ( Olodo et al., 2020 ). The plant root system is responsible for water and nutrient uptake from the soil and is a key determinant of plant performance in these conditions. The root system of pearl millet is characterized by a fast-growing primary root which is the only component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( Pass et al.,2016 ). We hypothesized that this fast-growing root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment, particularly to early drought episodes ( Pass et al, 2016 ) and tested this hypothesis using a panel of pearl millet inbred lines ( Deu et al, 2018 )
Researchers investigated how the brain processes concrete and abstract concepts during real-world processing, focusing on the role of visual context. They found that concrete and abstract concepts encode different types of information in separate brain regions, but these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, abstract words become more concrete-like when processed in scenes related to their meaning, and vice versa when context is unrelated, activation resembles abstract processing. These results suggest that concepts encode experiences, but neurobiological organisation is dynamic and depends on contextual information.

The brain integrates information across sensory modalities to form conceptual representations, critical for navigating real-world experiences. The study tested if response profiles change depending on objects in context, predicting that abstract concepts in related contexts engage regions involved in concrete and external information processing. Concrete concepts in unrelated contexts engage abstract regions related to internal/interceptive information. Analyses showed activation changes in concrete and abstract processing as a function of visual context, proposing erosion of the concrete/abstract dichotomy, showing both draw on experience and linguistic information.

Regions involved in processing both types include sensory, motor, and language areas. Overlap between concrete and abstract conditions found in ACC, thalamus, and temporal lobe, proposing when concrete is processed, relates to internal/interceptive and linguistic associations. Regions in processing both types did not imply dichotomous encoding, with sensory, motor, and language areas involved. The study aligns with literature identifying distinct brain regions for abstract and concrete words. Future research could explore different sensory contexts and their contribution to neural encoding.

Abstract concepts become concrete when situated, with overlap in fusiform and occipital lobe. The relationship between concepts and language remains open, but determinants of meaning are necessary for language. The study examined language-driven processing, with activation during word processing, implying neurobi processes are distributed and contextually determined. The representation of concrete concepts will be related to brain regions retaining sensory and motor information. Results are consistent with encoding concepts in sensory and motor experiences.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Inhibition at concentrations as low as 600 nM led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near total blockade of the NMD pathway ( Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 6 ). Western blotting showed that KVS0001 substantially decreases the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines ( Figure 3F )

., 2021; Hu et al., 2017 ). Indeed, previous studies with non-specific or toxic NMD inhibitors have shown an increase in selected antigens from tumor-specific mutations when NMD is inhibited ( Becker et al., 2021 ). We therefore investigated whether KVS0001 could similarly alter the cell surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in NCI-H358 and LS180 cells

. Additionally, treatment of NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines with a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11, resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, just as did LY3023414 ( Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3; Gopalsamy et al., 2012 ). Although SMG1i-11 displayed considerable SMG1 specificity and marked inhibition of NMD, it was highly insoluble

., 2013 ). Despite these chemistry-related challenges, our screen offered an unbiased assessment of the best targets for NMD pathway disruption, and thus we concluded that SMG1 was an ideal protein to inhibit for this purpose. In light of this, we attempted to improve the biophysical properties of SMG1i-11 through the development of KVS0001. As reported in this study, KVS0001 was a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that was soluble and could easily be administered to mice

., 2007; Zhao et al., 2022; Gotham et al., 2016; Gopalsamy et al., 2012 ). In this work, we create a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function. From this screen, we identify a lead compound capable of inhibiting NMD and ascertain its protein target as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -related kinase ( SMG1 ), a kinase that is a critical mediator of NMD

., 2016 ). siRNA-mediated knockdown of each of these kinases in NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines was performed for this purpose ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Only knockdown of SMG1 resulted in significant changes in the amount of truncating mutant transcript relative to wild-type transcript in all four genes evaluated ( Figure 3A, top )

. In syngeneic mouse models, KVS0001 slowed the growth of some tumors containing multiple truncating mutations, but only when the mice were immunocompetent. This dependence on an intact immune system supports the idea that the slowed growth of the treated tumors was due to recognition of neoantigens. Despite these encouraging data, the potential utility of KVS0001 for therapeutic purposes remains speculative, for several reasons

. Among these, KVS0001 stood out due to its solubility while preserving SMG1 inhibitory activity ( Supplementary file 3, Figure 3C, and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). Mass spectrometry-based assays showed that KVS0001 inhibits SMG1 protein more than any of the other 246 protein or lipid kinases tested at concentrations from 10 nM to 1 µM ( Supplementary file 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 5; Patricelli et al., 2011 )

., 2021 ). This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I complexes, rendering them invisible to immune cells ( Dalton et al., 2019 ). Previous work has shown knockdown of the NMD pathway with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) enhances the anti-tumor immune response ( Pastor et al., 2010; Castle et al., 2014 )

. e., protein synthesis inhibition-based NMD effects versus targeted NMD pathway inhibition as one example ). The optimal inhibitor of NMD found in our screen was LY3023414, and we suspected that this compound may inhibit the kinase SMG1 based on previously published kinase activity data with this small molecule ( Smith et al., 2016 ). SMG1 acts as the gatekeeper of UPF1 activity through its phosphorylation at multiple sites ( Yamashita et al., 2001 )

., 2019; Pastor et al., 2010; Nogueira et al., 2021 ). In normal cells, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) plays an important role in messenger RNA ( mRNA ) quality control, as well as normal gene expression ( Frischmeyer and Dietz, 1999; Mendell et al., 2004; Carrard and Lejeune, 2023; Sun and Chen, 2023 ). In cancer cells, however, NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants ( Nogueira et al., 2021 )

., 2011 ). Noteworthy off-target kinase inhibition was not observed until doses of 1 µM and above. Experiments using NCI-H358 and LS180 cells showed that KVS0001 is bioactive in the nanomolar range and subverts the NMD-mediated downregulation of truncating mutant transcripts and proteins ( Figure 3D, E, Figure 3—figure supplements 6 and 7 )

. Although murine and human SMG1 are highly related ( 98% at the amino acid level ), it was important to show that KVS0001 could actually inhibit NMD in murine cells. For this purpose, we tested eight genes in LLC, and four in RENCA, which contained out-of-frame indel mutations potentially targeted by NMD. We also assessed the expression of three genes without any mutations known to have their normal expression controlled by NMD ( Echols et al., 2020 )

. First, we do not understand why KVS0001 ( and other NMD inhibitors ) increase the expression of many, but not all, genes with truncating mutations. We also do not systematically address the changes to splicing that are undoubtedly occurring when NMD is disrupted in either normal or tumor tissue. More research on the biochemistry of NMD will undoubtedly be required for such understanding, and perhaps the tools described here may facilitate that effort

. Treatment of KVS0001 not only increased levels of transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, but also increased the levels of corresponding peptide bound–HLA complexes on the cell surfaces. We developed a new bispecific antibody, KVS-B043, which could recognize these pHLA complexes when the truncating mutations were present in the TP53 gene and destroy cancer cells harboring such mutations

. As the lead compound produced unacceptable toxicity in animal models, we then designed a specific and bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of SMG1 ( KVS0001 ) that is well-tolerated in vivo. We then demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SMG1 by KVS0001 leads to the presentation of novel neoantigens identifiable by T-cells leading to tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

. These three peptides were chosen based on an in silico review of potentially presented peptides and a preliminary experiment that looked at qualitative ( present or not present ) presentation of the predicted peptides ( Reynisson et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2021 ). To test whether cancer cell neoantigens presented as a result of NMD inhibition could be targeted, we evaluated two cancer cell lines, NCI-H716 and NCI-H2228 ( Supplementary file 1 )

., 2016; Klijn et al., 2015 ). Treatment with KVS0001 increased the expression of TP53 protein in both lines, while the commonly used therapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin did not ( Figure 3, Figure— supplement 3 ). We also found that K000 increased the expression of TP53 protein in cells with TP53 mutations ( Figure 3, Figure— supplement 3 ), which was not the case with 5-fluoracil or doxorubicin ( Figure 3,— supplement 3 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals. We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer. Using Cox regression models, we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374, 463 participants from the UK Biobank. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual, and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ). Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1. 22 ( 95% confidence interval, 1. 18–1. 27 ) in men, and 1. 26 ( 1. 22–1. 31 ) in women, respectively. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2. 29 ( 2. 10–2. 51 ) for men and 1. 94 ( 1. 78–2. 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = –1. 01 in men, p<0. 001; Beta = –0. 98 in women, p<0. 001 ). Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 82230110, 82125033, 82388102 to GJ; 82273714 to MZ ) ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20220100 to MZ ).

    In this study, we calculated PhenoAgeAccel to explore the effect of accelerated aging on the risk of cancer, and demonstrated a positive association between accelerated aging and increased cancer risk after adjustment for chronological age in the UK Biobank. Meanwhile, older PhenoAge was consistently associated with an increased absolute risk of incident cancer within each genetic risk group; and participants with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge had the greatest incident cancer risk

. In summary, our study showed that accelerated aging, which was measured by PhenoAgeAccel, was consistently related to an increased risk of several site-specific cancer and overall cancer with adjustment for chronological age, within and across genetic risk groups

. In further stratification analyses by genetic risk category with younger PhenoAge as the reference group, we confirmed that older PhenoAge was significantly associated with a higher incident cancer risk across genetic risk groups ( Table 3 ). Among participants at high genetic risk, the standardized 5 year incident cancer rates were 5. 78% and 4. 58% for biologically younger men and women versus 6. 90% and 5. 17% for those older, respectively

. As a result, results from this study would provide a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age as well as a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction. The associations between biological age and cancer risk has been investigated by several studies recently ( Li et al

. 3 ) in our study. These findings indicated that the different measures of biological age may reflect the different aspects of aging, and could be joint application in cancer risk assessment. Recently, several studies have confirmed the associations between PhenoAgeAccel and cancer risk. Mak et al

. 0001 ) per 5 years increase ( Table 2 ). We also observed a significant gradient increase in incident cancer risk from decile 1 to decile 10 of PhenoAgeAccel ( Figure 3C and D ). Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with HRs of 1. 22 ( 95% CI, 1. 18–1. 27, p<0. 0001 ) in men, 1. 26 ( 95% CI, 1. 22–1. 31, p<0. 0001 ) in women, respectively ( Figure 3E and F )

., 2017; Mars et al., 2020 ). Recently, we systematically created site-specific cancer PRS for 20 cancer types, and constructed an incidence-weighted CPRS to assess the effect of genetic risk on overall incident cancer risk based on the UK Biobank ( Zhu et al., 2021 ). Previous studies had indicated an interaction between genetic factors and age on cancer risk ( Mavaddat et al., 2015 )

. In addition, to evaluate the implication for cancer screening in populations with different PhenoAgeAccel, we estimated the 5 year absolute risk of overall cancer between biologically younger and older participants with increasing age

. We also assessed the extent to which a level of accelerated aging was associated with an increased overall cancer risk across groups with a different genetic risk defined by the CPRS.

. Therefore, our findings provided the evidence for PhenoAgeAccel to be used for risk stratification of cancer, which were independent from genetic risk. Moreover, we also demonstrated that participants with older biological age often reaches the screening threshold 2 years in advance compared with biologically younger peers; and keeping a healthy lifestyle can effectively slow down the aging process

. The overall incident cancer risk is associated with both genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel in a dose-response manner ( Figure 4 ). Of participants with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge, the incidence rates of overall cancer per 100, 000 person-years were estimated to be 1477. 89 ( 95% CI, 1410. 87–1544. 92 ) in men and 1076. 17 ( 95% CI, 1014. 14–1138. 19 ) in women versus 581. 06 ( 95% CI, 537. 12–625. 00 ) in men and 594. 71 ( 95% CI, 558. 50–630

. Similar patterns were noted in a series of sensitivity analyses with reclassifying accelerated aging levels according to quartiles or tertiles of the PhenoAgeAccel ( Supplementary file 1b ), exclusion of incident cancer cases occurred during the two years of follow-up ( Supplementary file 1c ), in the unimputed data ( Supplementary file 1d ), in the unrelated British population ( Supplementary file 1e ), or using retrained PhenoAge in cancer-free participants ( Supplementary file 1f )

. Older age has been long recognized as the main risk factor for cancer, and the multistage model of carcinogenesis posits that the exponential increase in cancer incidence with age were mainly resulted from the sequential accumulation of oncogenic mutations in different tissues throughout life ( Laconi et al., 2020 ). In consistent with this, age and exposure ( i. e

. 90% and 5. 17% for those older, respectively. Similarly, among participants at low genetic risk, the standardized 5 year incident cancer rates increased from 2. 71% and 2. 83% for biologically younger to 3. 87% and 3. 39% for those older in men and women, respectively. Similar patterns were noted by reclassifying accelerated aging levels into low ( the bottom quintile of PhenoAgeAccel ), intermediate ( quintiles 2–4 ), and high ( the top quintile ) ( Supplementary file 1h )

. Mak et al., 2023 explored three measures of biological age, including PhenoAge, and assessed their associations with the incidence of overall cancer and five common cancers ( breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, and melanoma ). In our previous study, we investigated the association between PhenoAgeAccel and lung cancer risk and analyzed the joint and interactive effects of PhenoAgeAccel and genetic factors on the risk of lung cancer ( Ma et al., 2023 )

., 2015 ). However, the extent to interaction between genetic factors and PhenoAge on overall cancer risk remained unclear. In this study, we calculated PhenoAge in accordance with the method described previously and then evaluated the effectiveness of PhenoAge in predicting the risk of overall cancer in the UK Biobank

. To generate an indicator of genetic risk for overall cancer, we constructed the CPRS as follows:CPRSi=∑k=1KhkPRSi, k Where CPRSi is the cancer polygenic risk score of ith individual, hk is the age-standardized incidence of site-specific cancer k in the UK population, and PRSi, k is the aforementioned PRS of site-specific cancer k. Given the different spectrum of cancer incidence between men and women, CPRS were constructed for males and females, respectively

. Assuming 2% of absolute risk within the next 5 years as the threshold to be recommended for cancer screening, biologically younger men would reach the threshold at age 55. 5 and women at 58.5 years, while those older would reach at 50.5 and 52.5 years, respectively.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The Biome mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed >6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0. 9 ), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

   ., 2020; Steen et al., 2019 ). This implies that SDMs may be substantially improved by utilising rapidly accumulating Biome‘s species occurrence records if we adequately control the sampling efforts. Here, we show the quality of community-based data gathered through the smartphone app Biome and how the data improves the prediction accuracy of species distribution. First, we assess the quality of occurrence records by investigating the fractions of non-wild and misidentified records

. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) are effective statistical tools for assessing biodiversity at specific sites while accounting for biases in survey efforts. SDMs use species occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate the potential geographic ranges and suitable habitats for species ( Booth et al., 2014; Box, 1981; Elith et al., 2011; Hutchinson, 1957; Phillips et al., 2006 )

. Thus, although much effort has been invested in developing effective monitoring and modelling methods for biodiversity assessment, current approaches can be further improved by incorporating ( i ) more enjoyable community-based survey platforms using mobile applications and ( ii ) employing an advanced statistical modelling framework in estimating species distribution

. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs ( Figure 3 ). The most accurate model predictions were obtained when the training data consisted of 50–70% Biome data ( Appendix 1 ), highlighting the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions ( Miller et al., 2019; Pacifici et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2020 )

. Second, we built SDMs based on two types of data: ( i ) traditional survey data ( e. g. forest inventory census, museum specimens, and records extracted from published researches ) only and ( ii ) a mixture of traditional survey and Biome data. We then compare the performance of the two SDMs. We modelled the distributions of 132 terrestrial animals and seed plants in the Japanese archipelago which covers subtropical to boreal areas

. Yet, the fraction of non-wild individuals is high in several taxa such as fishes and seed plants. In response, we have updated the posting flow in the app to prompt users to differentiate between non-wild and wild individuals. Further analysis is warranted to evaluate the impact of this update on data quality. Once we could exclude non-wild individuals, species identification accuracy exceeded 95% in taxa with moderate species diversity ( amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals )

., 2011; Ward et al., 2009 ). Due to the unavailability of absence data, SDM outputs in this work are indirect measures of species presence and thus are not directly comparable across different species. Nonetheless, they are comparable within a species, providing useful information for understanding species distributions. By blending data from traditional surveys and communities, we improved the accuracy of species distribution estimates

. The impact of community-sourced data on SDMs has primarily been investigated using birds, with a limited focus on plants ( Feldman et al., 2021 ). In our investigation, we observed that incorporating Biome data improved SDM accuracy for seed plants and insects, while the impact on birds remained unclear ( Figure 3 ). This ambiguity is likely because community-sourced data from platforms such as eBird are already incorporated in Traditional data through GBIF

., 2017; Zapponi et al., 2017 ) but also for modelling purposes. Considering the rapid accumulation of Biome data, Biome data would make a significant contribution to the more effective distribution modelling of endangered species. In assessing data quality, reidentification was impossible for records that did not photograph key traits for species identification. To address this limitation, further app improvements can include allowing users to submit multiple images

., 2008 ), became accurate in a much fewer amount of records by blending Biome data ( Figure 3 ). Specifically, a threshold of >0. 9 BI could be reached with only around 300 records when using Biome data, whereas over six times of data is required when using Traditional survey data only. This finding highlights the importance of community-sourced data not only for monitoring the dynamics of endangered species ( Chandler et al., 2017; Zapponi et al

. This enhanced estimation lays the groundwork for more precise subsequent analyses. For instance, estimated distributions will be useful in selecting new protected areas or areas with Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures ( OECMs ) : allowing a wider range of land use as long as biodiversity and ecosystem services are sustained/improved. Using estimated distributions of each species, hotspots of species or evolutionary diverse taxa can be inferred

. Improved estimation through SDMs can mitigate the risks associated with their use in society and enable more informed decision-making for conservation efforts. The rapid accumulation of data from diverse locations holds the potential to unveil valuable ecological patterns. The accumulated data enables early detection capabilities for range expansions of invasive species ( Sakai et al., in preparation )

. Since SDMs are influenced by invalid presence records, we assessed the quality of Biome data based on a total of 1420 records from rare and common species of seed plants, molluscs, insects ( including Arachnid and Insecta ), fishes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians ( Figure 4 ). We defined rare species as those with less than or equal to 10 occurrences in Biome data, and common species as those with the highest 15% of records in each taxonomic category

Since its launch in 2019, the app Biome has accumulated species occurrence data rapidly ( Figure 2 ). Despite our concerted efforts to engage non-expert users through gamification features, it is important to acknowledge that an excessive influx of non-expert users could potentially compromise the quality of the collected data. This could manifest in misidentifications or incomplete documentation, such as failing to appropriately label non-wild individuals

., 2023; Newbold et al., 2016 ). Traditionally, distribution data was acquired through on-site surveys by experts ( people have expertise about biodiversity ), but collecting distribution data with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is challenging if we rely only on such limited human resources ( Miya et al., 2022; Mori et al., 2023; Pocock et al., 2018 )

. In comparison to other taxonomic groups, our results indicate that seed plants exhibited lower model accuracy when evaluated against both Biome + Traditional survey data ( Figure 3 ) and Traditional survey data alone ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). The variation in model accuracy among taxonomic groups may be attributed to data quality issues in both Biome and Traditional survey data

. This becomes especially problematic when flowers are not present. These difficulties could potentially impact the quality of Traditional data as well. Although few studies have simultaneously assessed the quality of community-sourced data and its impact on SDMs across different taxa, it is important to recognise that data quality can vary among taxa. Importantly, SDMs for endangered species, which often suffer from data deficit ( Erickson and Smith, 2023; Wisz et al

., 2011; Phillips and Dudík, 2008 ). Since MaxEnt only requires occurrence records, it is well-suited for empowering community-based observations to predict species distributions. Also, while community-sourced data often suffer from spatially biased sampling efforts ( i. e. sampling tends to concentrate in densely populated or touristic areas; Kendal et al

. Such sites will be good candidates for protected areas ( Jones et al., 2016 ) or OECMs ( Shiono et al., 2021 ). Further, estimated distributions can be used as input for spatial conservation prioritisation tools ( e. g. Marxanl Ball et al., 2009 ). In our experience, stakeholders—including corporate social responsibility managers and conservation practitioners—often seek the list of species potentially inhabiting their locations

., 2017; Robinson et al., 2020 ). The improvement can be attributed to introducing data with different biases compared to the Traditional survey data. Indeed, when controlling for the number of occurrence records, the model performance was higher in the Biome + Traditional data ( Figure 3 ) than in Traditional data alone ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. 

    Supporting Text:
    Our current study provides solid in vivo evidence for the first time that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. Interestingly, congenital pulmonary cysts are reported in human CPAM patients as a result of abnormal prenatal lung development ( Stocker, 2009 )

. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs ( Wang et al., 2013; Liberti et al., 2019; Rockich et al., 2013 ). In summary, mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis

. Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage ( embryonic day [E]12. 5 to E14. 5 ), its expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is also evident during mid-gestation ( Sun et al., 2008 ). Herein, we specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation

. The inverse relationship between Bmpr1a deletion ( intracellular BMP signaling ) and Bmp4 ligand expression in these fetal lung mesenchymal progenitor cells was further confirmed by comparing Bmp4 expression in isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells with different Bmpr1a genotypes ( Figure 7D and E ). Alterations of other key pathways including Fgf, Wnt, and Shh were not detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR through analyzing the related targeted genes.

. This pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( CPAM ). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.

. Disruption of Bmpr1a-mediated mesenchymal signaling causes prenatal airway malformation and cystic lesions. Multiple mechanisms, including deficiency of airway smooth muscle, airway elastin fiber defect, and perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 epithelial progenitor axis, may contribute to the congenital airway cystic pathogenesis. In addition, the downstream Smad-independent p38 pathway appears to be critical in mediating BMP-regulated airway smooth muscle development

. For example, in E15. 5 mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a conditional knockout ( CKO ), Bmpr1a immunostaining was absent in lung mesenchyme but present in the epithelia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) while Bmpr1a was detected in both mesenchyme and epithelia of wildtype ( WT ) lungs. By gross view with quantitative analysis ( Figure 1A–C ), early embryonic lung morphogenesis between Bmpr1a CKO lungs and WT controls was comparable prior to E13. 5

., 1999; Bellusci et al., 1996 ). However, the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in regulating fetal lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lung mesenchyme-specific targeting tools in the past. We recently generated a lung mesenchyme-specific Tbx4 lung enhancer-driven loxP/Cre mouse driver line ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling specifically in lung mesenchymal cells in vivo and to study its role in the lung development

. To determine whether BMP signaling can directly regulate elastin expression in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, alteration of elastin protein expression upon BMP4 treatment in primary fetal lung mesenchymal cells was analyzed. A significant increase in elastin protein was observed in the cells treated with BMP4 ( Figure 3E and F ). However, inclusion of the BMP type 1 receptor ( BMPR1 ) inhibitor LDN193189 ( LDN ) fully blocked the BMP4-stimulated elastin upregulation

. The upregulation of multiple Bmp ligands, particularly Bmp4, in the Bmpr1a CKO lung tissues as compared with the WT lungs is a complex scenario. The isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells of Bmpr1a CKO mice also showed increased Bmp4 expression as compared to the WT lung cells. This might be due to an autoregulatory feedback loop between Bmp ligand expression and intracellular BMP signaling

. Ectopic expression of Bmp4 in fetal mouse lung has been reported to cause distal epithelial expansion ( Bellusci et al., 1996 ). Increased expression of Bmp4 in E15. 5 Bmpr1a CKO lungs was initially found by RNA-seq ( logFC>1, GEO#: GSE97946 ) and validated by RT-PCR ( Figure 7C )

. This makes it difficult to study the pathogenic molecular mechanisms that trigger early cyst formation during fetal lung development in human subjects. Studies in mouse models suggest that altered growth factor signaling in a prenatal time window is sufficient to cause cyst formation ( Miao et al., 2021 ). The abnormal BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the initiation of CPAM, but not in the later stage when cystic lesions have formed

. The role of Bmpr1a in mediating Smad1/5 activation in lung mesenchymal cells was further investigated in primary culture of fetal lung mesenchymal cells isolated from WT fetal lung tissues. Treatment of these cells with BMP4 activated Smad1/5 phosphorylation, while the addition of BMPR1 inhibitor LDN reduced the BMP4-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation ( Figure 4E )

. Evidence increasingly suggests that the lung mesenchyme is closely involved in respiratory lineage specification and epithelial differentiation by producing many critical signaling molecules, such as Bmp ligands, that direct endodermal expression of specific cell markers in a temporal and spatial fashion ( McCulley et al., 2015; Morrisey and Hogan, 2010 )

., 2014 ). The mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells regulate airway epithelial cell fate during lung development are largely unknown. Interestingly, in the Bmpr1a CKO lung, Sox2-positive epithelial cells were barely detected in the proximal airways. Similarly, lack of further differentiation of Foxj1-positive cells was also observed

. Treatment of lung mesenchymal progenitor cells with BMP4 induced a pronounced increase in the expression of these SMC-related genes at both the mRNA and protein levels ( Figure 4F and G ). Inhibition of either Bmpr1a by LDN or p38 by SB203580 ( SB ) significantly attenuated the promoting effect of BMP4 on SMC differentiation. As shown in Figure 2E, Bmpr1a CKO caused defective growth of airway SMCs in vivo, while vascular SMCs remained unaffected

. 5–9. 5 ) before lung organogenesis ( Mishina et al., 1995 ). As reported by us and other groups, both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation, which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation ( Luo et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2008; Weaver et al., 1999; Bellusci et al.,1996 ). However, the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lungenchyme targeting tools in the past. We generated a mesyme-specific Tbx lung enhancer-driven lox/Cre mouse line ( Zhang et al,2013 ) which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling in lungenchyme cells in vivo and study its role in lung development

To determine whether BMP can regulate elastin expression in fetal mesenchymal cells, alteration of elastin protein upon BMP4 treatment in primary lungenchal cells was analyzed. A significant increase in elastin was observed in cells treated with BMP ( Figure 3 and F ) However, inclusion of BMP1 receptor inhibitor LD193 LD fully blocked the BMP-stimulated elastin upregulation. The upregulation multiple B ligands particularly Bmp in B1 CKO lungs compared to WT is complex The isolated lungench cells of B1 CK also showed B expression compared to WT cells This might be due autoregulatory loop B ligand expression intracellular signaling.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated. 

    Supporting Text:
    We examined the dynamics and functional roles of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 as the boundary and/or neighboring lipid of EGFR in the activation of EGFR by EGF stimulation. Superresolution microscopy revealed that EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 form nanodomains that partially overlap before EGF stimulation. The nanodomains also form domain clusters and the extent of coaggregation of EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 molecules in a higher-order domain structure decreases after EGF stimulation

., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 ). Apart from these in silico and in vitro studies, the localization and roles of PS and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 during EGFR activation have not been fully investigated experimentally in living cells due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR in the plasma membrane. The main difficulty is that the proposed size of the lipid domain is below the diffraction limit of light

., 2006 ). Here, we visualized both the EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane with SMLM. We found that the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains and EGFR nanoclusters aggregate together before EGF stimulation. After stimulation, the degree of coaggregation decreases, which depends on PLCγ but not on phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ). The local PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EGFR autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF

. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in the deactivation of EGFR. Our results suggest that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environments regulates EGFR activity.

. The preferential coaggregation of the EGFR nanodomains with PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 rather than PS is probably due to the following two factors. The first is the curvature of the membrane. Previous electron microscopy–bivariate analyses showed that the nanodomains of inactive HRAS were enriched with PI ( 4, 5 ) P2, whereas those of active KRAS4B were enriched with PS due to highly specific RAS–lipid interactions determined by the membrane curvature ( Liang et al., 2019; Zhou et al

. Single-molecule imaging confirmed these results, detecting the transient colocalization of EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. The expression of a PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 phosphatase reduced the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro and in silico observations that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 interacts strongly with the arginine residues in the JM-A region of EGFR, stabilizing the active conformation of EGFR ( Abd Halim et al

., 2017 ). Here, it is shown that EGF stimulation reduces the density of small PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane around the EGFR. Together, these results indicate that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is hydrolyzed by PLCγ only in the region surrounding EGFR. In contrast, synaptojanin expression reduces PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 levels by 45% ( Field et al., 2005 ), leading to defects in cytokinesis and mislocalization of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-binding proteins to the plasma membrane ( Abe et al

. We expect this state to facilitate the higher-order oligomerization of EGFR, which is important for signaling to cytoplasmic proteins ( Hiroshima et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 ). We found that of PI3K and PLCγ, PLCγ is responsible for the disaggregation of the EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains after EGFR phosphorylation. The difference between the effects of PI3K and PLCγ on the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains can be explained as follows

. PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is involved in the complicated remodeling of the boundary lipids and higher-order membrane structure around EGFR. To detect whole these processes directly, further observations are required using cholesterol and DAG probes under SMLM or electron microscopy. Alternatively, further biochemical analyses measuring the local lipid contents around EGFR should be performed.

., 2012; Makino et al., 2017 ). Together with the results of the present study, this suggests that cholesterol- and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-rich membrane domains exist in the plasma membrane, form higher-order aggregates, and transiently colocalize with EGFR clusters before EGF stimulation. Such membrane structures may prevent EGFR from activation because cholesterol exerts an inhibitory effect on EGFR

. However, after simulation with 0. 2 nM EGF, no significant difference in the phosphorylation of EGFR was observed between the cells as EGFR was less phosphorylated under the current experimental conditions. These results confirm that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is important for not only the dimerization of EGFR but also its subsequent phosphorylation. A biochemical analysis showed that the amount of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is transiently reduced after EGF stimulation in cells ( Malek et al., 2017 )

., 2022; Matsushita et al., 2013 ). The aggregation of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 with EGFR in the plasma membrane may help to stabilize the dimers of EGFR after its association with EGF

. We found that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is also involved in a specific pathway of EGFR deactivation after EGF stimulation. Tyr-phosphorylated EGFR recruits PLCγ, degrading PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 and producing DAG. DAG activates protein kinase C, which phosphorylates Thr654 of EGFR, deactivating EGFR ( Figure 7E, right ). We have reported previously that Thr654 phosphorylation causes the JM-A dimer to dissociate in the presence of acidic lipids ( Maeda et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 )

., 2015; Matsushita et al., 2013 ). Together with these observations, our biochemical analyses suggest that the local distribution of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR before EGF stimulation not only acts as the substrate of EGFR effectors, including PI3K and PLCγ, after EGF stimulation, but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the dimerization and kinase activation of EGFR immediately after EGF stimulation ( Figure 7E, left )

. These results support the idea that PLCγ and PI3K react differently to PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane. As shown in Figure 6, we found that PLCγ is responsible for the reduced coaggregation of EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 after EGF stimulation. PLCγ produces DAG, which is known to activate protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Steinberg, 2008 ). PKC activation is known to induce the phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654 ( Hunter et al

., 2003; Sugiyama et al., 2023 ). Tetraspanins also indirectly interact with PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( Halova and Draber, 2017 ). PI 4 ,5 P is involved in the formation of higher-order lipid structures in the plasma membrane around EGFR, which is important for its activation. PI 4 , 5 P is hydrolyzed by PLCγ after EGF stimulation, producing DAG. DAG activates PKC, which phosphorylates EG-Th654, deactivating EG. PI 4, 5 is also involved in the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after EGF. PI 4 5 is hydrolyzed by PLCγ after EGF, producing DAG, which activates PKC, phosphorylating EG-Th654, deactivating EG. PI 4 5 is involved in the dimer and autophosphorylation of EG after EGF PI 4 5 is hydrolyzed by PLC after E producing DAG activating PKC phosphorylating EG654 deactivating PI 4 5 is involved in dimer autophosphorylation after EGF PI 5 hydrolyzed by PLC producing DAG activating PK phosphorylating654 deactiv PI 5 is involved in dimer autophosphorylation after EGF 5 hydrolyzed by PLC producing DAG activating phosphoryl654 deactiv PI 5 is in dimer autophosphorylation after E hydrolyzed by PLC producing DAG activating phosphoryl654 deactiv PI5 is in dimer autophosphorylation after hydroly by PLC producing DAG activating phosphoryl654deactiv PI5 in dimer autophorylation after hydro by PLC producing DAG activating phosphoryl654deactiv PI in dimer autophory after hydro by PLC producing DAG phosphoryl654deactiv PI dimer autory after hydro by PLC DAG phosphoryldeactiv PI dimer after hydro by DAG phosphorylde

    Title: 
    Abstract: Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms, including multicellular algae, the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato blight Phytophthora, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ). In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. 

    Supporting Text:
    The last enzyme of the cytosolic phase of glycolysis in Blastocystis is triosephosphate isomerase ( Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). Consequently, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate need to be transported into the mitochondrial matrix for the pay-off phase of glycolysis. Given the presence of mitochondrial glycolysis in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is not only ubiquitous in stramenopiles, but also absent in other eukaryotes

. We characterized one of these unique Blastocystis carriers, which has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Instead, this carrier can transport several glycolytic intermediates, including dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ), thus providing a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis

. The second ‘pay-off’ phase leads to the production of ATP, NADH, and pyruvate, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Bricker et al., 2012; Herzig et al., 2012 ). In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a cytosolic process with the exception of trypanosomes, where it is localized in the glycosomes ( Opperdoes and Borst, 1977 )

. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a mitochondrial carrier protein unique to stramenopiles that transports the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and PEP, providing the heretofore missing transport link. Since mitochondrial glycolysis is found exclusively in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is ubiquitous in these species, but not in other eukaryotes

. Unlike other stramenopiles, Blastocystis has lost the cytosolic pay-off phase of glycolysis, consistent with the absence of a gene encoding a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). The only exception is the last enzyme of the pathway, pyruvate kinase, which was also identified as a cytosolic protein ( Lantsman et al., 2008 ). Blastocystis is an anaerobe ( Zierdt, 1991 ) with highly divergent mitochondria ( Stechmann et al., 2008 )

. A mitochondrial phosphate carrier homologue was identified in the phylogenetic analysis of Blastocystis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), which is driven by the proton motive force to maintain high concentrations of phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix, which in turn could drive the uptake of glycolytic intermediates. Blastocystis lacks many of the conserved carrier proteins found in the mitochondria of aerobes

. This role was taken over by transfer of the pay-off phase of glycolysis to the mitochondrial matrix in Blastocystis, which has several advantages. The degradation of one glucose molecule in the cytosol requires one ATP and one pyrophosphate molecule, but will generate four ATP molecules in the mitochondrial matrix, which can be used for ATP-requiring processes, such as protein import, mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, and mitochondrial protein synthesis ( Denoeud et al

. Moreover, the newly discovered glycolytic intermediates carrier demonstrates the plasticity of mitochondrial carriers in terms of their substrate specificity. Through the discovery of this carrier, we have linked the two halves of glycolysis and provided a potential target for specific treatment not only for Blastocystis but also for other stramenopile pathogens that threaten global food security.

Glycolysis is a textbook example of a well-conserved cytosolic pathway. However, the discovery that glycolysis is branched and also mitochondrial in stramenopiles ( Abrahamian et al., 2017; Río Bártulos et al., 2018; Nakayama et al., 2012 ) raises questions about how glycolytic intermediates are transported across the tightly controlled mitochondrial inner membrane

. This reaction may play a significant role in cytosolic ATP generation, as there is no mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in Blastocystis for adenine nucleotide exchange ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Blastocystis also contains a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( Gentekaki et al., 2017 ), which oxidizes NADH to convert glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which in turn can be transported into mitochondria by bGIC-2 to generate ATP and reducing equivalents

., 2018; Minh et al., 2020 ). A clade of stramenopile-specific transporters was identified as a sister group to the A. thaliana DTC homologues ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Within this clade, all selected stramenopile species were represented at least once. Interestingly, Blastocystis, which has no homologue of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, and would have to rely solely on the import of glycolytic intermediates, has four copies of this carrier

. As glycolysis in Blastocystis would be critically dependent on this transporter, we used this parasite as a model organism. We focussed on mitochondrial carboxylate carriers because of their ability to transport phosphorylated three-carbon substrates ( Castegna et al., 2010; Fiermonte et al., 2001; Palmieri et al., 1972 ) and compared the sequences of carboxylate carriers from all major eukaryotic supergroups

. However, it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes, the stramenopiles, have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localized in mitochondria ( Abrahamian et al., 2017; Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae, which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans ( Burki et al., 2020 )

. We characterized human and Blastocystis carboxylate carriers and demonstrated that the stramenopile GIC proteins have a unique substrate specificity that is distinct from the human carriers ( Figure 6 ). We also characterized the substrate specificity of Blastocystis OGC, which has the same specificity as human OGC ( SLC25A11 ), and we demonstrated that it is unable to transport glycolytic intermediates and thus could not be the missing transport step in the branched glycolytic pathway

., 2020 ), which share a common evolutionary ancestor with stramenopiles ( Burki et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the GIC of stramenopiles is probably derived from a common ancestor with DTC and does not exist in any other eukaryote outside of the stramenopile clade. Blastocystis was used in this study as a stramenopile model organism, as it relies solely on glycolysis for its energy demands and does not have a second branch of glycolysis in the cytosol ( R Bárt et al. 2018 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: at each locus, a deep learning model ( in this study, Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual. This score, defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ), replaces the original genotype in association studies. Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’. Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16. 1–39. 8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits.

   . We designated this activity score as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) and analyzed the association between the HFS and each trait. Our findings confirm that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods, thereby demonstrating its value in genetic association studies.

. An example of such data is the EN-TEX ( Rozowsky et al., 2023 ) dataset, which aligns functional genomic peaks with the specific individuals and haplotypes they correspond to. In summary, our results demonstrate that incorporating HFS to represent genetically determined functional genomic activities in genetic association studies offers robust improvements in both the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits

In this study, we designed the new HFS framework for genetic association analysis and demonstrated that it could improve classic SNP-based analysis in terms of causal loci and gene identification, biological interpretation and polygenic prediction. We suggest that HFS is a promising strategy for future genetic studies, but more progresses in algorithm and computation and data resources are still desired. Compared with SNP, HFS has several compelling features

. 95, hereafter referred to as ‘causal loci’. Compared with SNP-based functionally aware fine-mapping methods PolyFun ( Weissbrod et al., 2020 ) and SbayesRC ( Zheng et al., 2022 ), HFS-based SUSIE detected −11 to 334 more causal signals ( median = 63, Supplementary file 1e ) for each trait. We cautioned that these methods use summary statistics as input and are by nature less sensitive than individual data-based methods

. We applied this framework to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB British ancestry training set ( n = 350, 587; Supplementary file 1b and Method ), identifying 16, 597 significant HFS–trait associations at a threshold of p < 5 × 10−8 ( n = 15 for insomnia, n = 7573 for height; Supplementary file 1b ), equating to roughly 3619 independent associations

., 2022 ). In this study, we present an analytical framework founded on this strategy ( Figure 1 ) and implement it on complex traits in the UK Biobank to pinpoint causal loci and genes, decipher biological mechanisms, and devise cross-ancestry prediction models. We segmented the human reference genome into multiple 4096 bp loci, generated DNA sequences for each locus for two haplotypes per individual, and employed Sei to compute the functional genomic activities of these sequences

., 2020 ), and protein and chromosomal structures, potentially employing AlphaFold ( Jumper et al., 2021 ) -derived features ( Liu et al., 2022 ). Analyzing HFS in conjunction with these multi-modal function scores could provide a comprehensive depiction of the genetic architecture of complex traits. However, the colossal computational cost is currently prohibitive. As a compromise, we simply performed joint analysis of HFS with SNP PRS in our prediction model analysis

. The sequence class score of the reference sequence class was defined as the HFS for this locus, and was used for downstream trait association analysis. For each locus, we calculated the association between trait-specific HFS and adjusted, normalized trait value by linear regression, without any covariates ( this is because all selected covariates have been adjusted at the normalization step )

. Lastly, we analyzed the potentiality of HFS in polygenic prediction accuracy. Compared with state-of-the-art SNP-based polygenic risk score ( PRS ) algorithm LDAK-BOLT ( Zhang et al., 2021b ), HFS-based PRS ( weighted by SUSIE posterior effect size ) reached 47–90% of R2 in independent European test set ( meta-analyzed proportion = 75. 6%, 95% confidence interval = 75. 3–75. 8%, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 )

. Taken together, we concluded that HFS could bring about mild but significant improvement to classic SNP-based PRS in the task of cross-ancestry polygenic prediction.

., 2003 ). Nonetheless, previous GWAS provided little evidence on this association. Secondly, HFS could integrate effects of all variants within a locus, regardless of their population frequency. Thus, HFS could capture information from rare variants overlooked by classic association study and improve polygenic prediction, as shown by our result

. We applied the same analysis on causal SNP, and compared AIC between HFS and SNP multivariate regression. Similar to the idea of LDSC ( Finucane et al., 2015 ), we first generated a series of baseline annotation of each locus, then tested whether locus PIP was associated with functional annotations after controlling the impact of these baseline annotations

. In contrast, our study leveraged sequence-determined functional genomic profiles in association studies, which mitigates this issue to an extent. For instance, although sei cannot identify the specific gene regulated by a given input sequence, it can predict changes in the sequence’s functional activity. Future improvements in DL models' ability to predict interindividual differences could be achieved by incorporating cross-individual data in the training process

. Thus, the application of the HFS framework in future genetic association studies holds considerable promise.

. For each locus, we annotated its relevance to a pathway by combined SNP to Gene ( CS2G ) strategy ( Gazal et al., 2022 ), and regressed the PIP against this annotation, with a set of baseline annotations included as covariates, similar to the LDSC framework ( Finucane et al., 2018 ) ( Method ). After p-value correction and recurrent pathway removal ( Method ), we detected a total of 727 pathway–trait associations ( Figure 3A and Supplementary file 1g )

. Taken together, our result suggests that fine-mapping results based on HFS could pinpoint the causal pathways, cell types, and tissues underlying complex traits, and is valuable for the biological interpretation of genetic association study. Enhanced power of fine-mapping and biological enrichment could reveal novel key genes for trait mechanism study

. Lastly, it is currently unfeasible to incorporate all genome-wide HFS into a single LASSO model. This limitation forced us to first integrate HFS into pre-locus score, which inevitably sacrificed the accuracy. Another hurdle arises in integrating HFS with other genomic features. Intrinsically, HFS captures only the variant effect mediated by functional genomics, while a genetic variant might also influence amino acids, post-transcriptional modifications ( PTMs ) ( Park et al

. 0001, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Taken together, HFS-based SUSIE is a powerful and robust strategy for individual data-based genetic fine-mapping. Pinpointing causal loci of complex traits provides the opportunity of analyzing the biological mechanism of them. Thus, based on the HFS-based fine-mapping result, we applied a linear regression model to analyze the underlying pathways, cell types, and tissues of each complex trait

. We selected the score corresponded to the sequence class of reference sequence as the HFS of the corresponding locus, and its association with each trait was computed using a generalized linear model. Simulation analysis revealed that when a non-reference sequence class score was associated the trait, reference class score could still capture median 70% of HFS–trait association R2

. We simulated trait levels using HFS data from chromosome 1 in a randomly selected 50, 000 samples from UKB EUR training data. We randomly selected 1% ( 500 ) loci, assigned effect size from standard normal distribution, and calculated the aggregated genetic liability. We then simulated trait levels with h2 = 0. 1. We applied HFS + SUSIE as well as REGENIE + PolyFun on simulated traits and calculated the area under curve ( AUC ), FDR at PIP >0. 95 for HFS + SUSIE

    A new framework for genetic association studies, called the Haplotype Score (HFS), was proposed to calculate the functional activity of haplotypes per individual. The FS score replaced the original genotype in studies and was applied to 14 traits in the UK Biob, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including 'circadian-chronotype' and 'aridonic-intelligence'. LASS regression integrated FS score with SNP-based polygenic scores showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ance poly prediction. The FS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.

The FS framework was designed to analyze the association between FS and each trait, confirming its improvement in biological and poly prediction of complex traits compared to SNP-based methods. The FS was applied to the ENTEX dataset, aligning functional peaks with individuals and haplotype, demonstrating robustness in genetically determined genomic activities. FS was compared to SNP-based methods, detecting 11-334 causal signals per trait. FS was applied to 14 traits in the UKB, identifying 16,597 FS-trait associations at p <5 ×10-8, equating to 361 independent associations. FS was used to pinpoint loci and genes, decipher mechanisms, and crossance models. FS segmented the genome into 409 loci, generated sequences for each haplotype, and employed Se to compute genomic activities. FS was analyzed with multi-modal scores, providing a comprehensive depiction of complex traits. FS was integrated with SNP-based polygenic scores, improving prediction. FS reached 47-90 R2 in European test, meta-analyzed 75.6, 95 CI 75.3-75.8. FS brought mild improvement to SNP-based PR in crossance prediction. FS captured rare variants overlooked by classic studies, improving poly prediction. FS was applied to SNP and AIC between FS and multivariate regression. FS detected 727-trait associations, 153-tissue with biological interpretability. FS was applied to pathways, cell, and tissues underlying traits, valuable for biological study.
A study investigated the impact of three types of mental training modules on hippocampal structure and function in 332 healthy adults. The modules focused on attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, and socio-cognitive skills. The study used longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI analysis to evaluate changes in hippocal subfield volume and intrinsic connectivity, and related these changes to diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. Results showed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume following 3 months of socioffective training, compared to socio-cognitive training or waitlist controls. Structural changes paralleled functional increases in CA-3 connectivity. Training-induced changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reductions in cortisol. A multivariate analysis found other subfields contributed to changes in cortisol levels. The study provides a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal substructure and function, and cortisol in healthy adults.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to explore patterns of local adaptation in three sunflower species: Helianthus annu, Helthus argyllus, and Helthus petolar, which harbor large species-specific inversions. They found significant genome-wide repeatability signatures of association with phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions harboring inversions in one species. This suggests that inversions facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can still contribute to adaptation without recombination suppression in species lacking segregating inversions. The study estimated that adaptation involves strong repeatability at a few genes associated with inversions and high redundancy across many loci. Inversions are implicated in adaptation due to recombination suppression among inverted and non-inverted haplotypes, maintaining linkage disequilibrium among locally adapted alleles. However, it is unclear how inversions covary with repeatability of adaptation among species. Studying adaptation at genomic regions harboring inversions in other species lacking inversions can provide insights into adaptation architecture and evolution of inversions. The study found that regions with inversions in one species tend to be enriched for signatures in other species lacking inversions, indicating some loci contribute to adaptation without recombination suppression. The basis of adaptation is highly repeatable, with large genes driving responses in multiple species, such as flowering time in plants and color polymorphisms in vertebrates. Divergent patterns of adaptation provide estimating importance of environment driving adaptation in both species across phenotypes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger <30 ( y ) ears old and older >55 y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

    Our studies show how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women. We show that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of the aging process and is likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age

. Here, we demonstrate how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation

., 2012 ). Thus, it is unclear how tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging reflect changes in cell-intrinsic and microenvironment states. Lineage-specific analyses are needed to unravel such mechanisms. The mammary epithelium, the origin of breast carcinomas, is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages—myoepithelial cells ( MEPs ) and luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs )

. We also demonstrate how increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes

. Both of our models of directional and variant changes with age led to a significant decrease in the differential magnitude of LEP- and MEP-specific expression in the older cells ( Figure 3E and G ). Together, these analyses show that increased variances in transcription are considerable drivers of the loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia

., 2019 ). Directional changes in gene expression with age have been reported in whole breast tissue, including changes associated with biological processes involved in breast cancer ( Lee and Lee, 2017; Yau et al., 2007 ). However, aging is also associated with significant shifts in proportions of breast cell lineages, including epithelial and stromal populations ( Benz, 2008; Garbe et al., 2012 )

., 2017 ). Here, we establish a statistical definition of loss of lineage fidelity and we underscore the genome-wide nature of this phenomenon whereby gene expression differences that distinguish the major epithelial lineages of the breast decrease with age

., 2009; Labarge et al., 2013 ) and enable detailed, reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression ( Stampfer et al., 2013 ). Moreover, there are well-established lineage-specific markers and cell-sorting protocols that facilitate experimentation at lineage-specific resolution. Furthermore, breast tissue provides an ideal model for studying aging-associated cancer susceptibility as 82% of new breast cancers are diagnosed in women ≥ 50 y ( DeSantis et al., 2019 )

. Furthermore, the divergence in the age-dependent DE and DV enrichment of cellular processes, such as MYC gene targets and genes involved in immunomodulatory signaling, suggests the genes that become variable with age are associated with pathways that are otherwise important in maintaining lineage-specificity and -function in younger cells. To further validate our findings, three publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from non-cancer primary human mammary gland organoids ( Murrow et al

. We previously demonstrated loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia as an aging phenomenon—in which the faithfulness of expression of established lineage-specific markers diminishes with age without loss of the lineage-specificity of other canonical markers nor of the gross phenotypic and histological differences between LEPs and MEPs ( Miyano et al., 2017 )

. Moreover, we showed that our aged luminal signature was enriched in women who received chemotherapy and those with increased risk of developing breast cancer, possibly capturing the accelerated aging phenotypes in these groups. Because LEPs dominated the age-specific signal amongst epithelia, we examined if the age-dependent DE contribution of the luminal lineage was detectable in bulk normal primary breast tissue ( GSE102088, n=114 ) ( Song et al., 2017 )

. We identified two models mediating loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia with age: ( i ) via directional changes identified through differential expression ( DE ) analysis; and ( ii ) via an increase in variances identified through differential variability ( DV ) analysis. Age-dependent DE explained part of the observed loss of lineage fidelity, while our model of the overall increase in variances with age also accounted for a comparable fraction of this loss

. Our findings lend further credence to loss of lineage fidelity and accelerated aging in women with BRCA1 mutations as Luminal1 cells from these women did not look as young as their age-matched average risk counterparts ( Figure 4E, right panel ) and resembled menopausal cells ( Figure 4D, right panel ). Parity and obesity are often discussed in the context of breast cancer susceptibility. To address how they may affect the aging signature, we used the Murrow et al. dataset

. Taken together, genes commonly DE in younger and older LEPs and breast tissue either reflect stereotypic aging-associated molecular changes across different breast cell populations or are driven by LEP-specific changes. This suggests that age-dependent molecular changes in LEPs contribute to essential processes involved in the aging biology of the entire breast and that are dysregulated in cancers

. These changes may reflect age-related dysregulation convergent with development of frank tumors. The degree and variability of these age-dependent changes across older individuals may explain the differential susceptibility between certain individuals to breast cancer initiation as they age and the development of specific breast cancer subtypes.

. 05; ) ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C ). These results suggest that subtype-specific expression of genes dysregulated with age in the LEP lineage also affect biology underlying survival outcomes specifically in patients with luminal type cancers. Our results illustrate that age-dependent changes in LEPs embody biology that is relevant to and contributes to tissue-level biology predictive of breast cancer subtypes

. The second model considered aging-associated increases in variances in the expression of lineage-specific genes in LEPs and/or MEPs from older women that led to a loss of detection of DE between lineages ( Figure 3Aii ). We describe the contributions of each in the following sections. There was an extreme lineage bias in the numbers of DE genes between younger and older cells, with the majority of age-dependent changes occurring in LEPs ( Figure 3—source data 1A and B )

. Directional changes in expression with age strikingly occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells, whereas changes in variance were found in both lineages. Genome-wide directional changes in gene expression in LEPs involved dysregulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 with age. We also detected this dysregulation in bulk tissue that consist of all lineages of the stroma and epithelia

. 95 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ). Because dysregulation of regulatory factors like transcription factors ( TFs ) could lead to further dysregulation of downstream targets, we compared TF expression between younger and older cells in each lineage. Expression of key TFs ( Lambert et al., 2018 ) was significantly altered in older cells. Fifty TFs showed age-dependent DE in LEPs and 4 TFs showed DE in MEPs ( adj. p<0

We propose that aging mechanisms operate through at least two distinct pathways: ( i ) General dysregulatory mechanisms, which are reflected in directional age-dependent changes that share common features with known cancer mechanisms. These changes contribute to an increased overall susceptibility to cancer as individuals age. ( ii ) Individual-specific dysregulatory mechanisms, which are identified by variations in aged populations

The study investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a bilayer of two phenotypically and functionally distinct lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepith cells. Mam luminal epithelia exhibit stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. The researchers generated transcriptomes from primary luminal epith and myepithelial cells from younger and older women and observed age-dependent changes in gene expression and increased transcription variance that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, while directional changes were almost exclusively in luminal and involved regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1. Epithelial expression of gap protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 in heterocultures revealed it provided communication from myepith that drove change in lum cells. Age luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine classifier based on lum-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer and was highly predictive of breast subtype. The study shows how directional and variant responses contribute to biology in breast of older women and that increased variances in transcript profiles of mammary lineages is a significant outcome of aging and central to understanding susceptibility to breast cancers with age.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i. e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.

   ., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2021 ), we asked if there was systematic variation in the numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among different T. arvense lines, and whether these data, together with our whole-genome plant sequencing data, could provide insights into the genomic basis of plant resistance variation. The goals of our study were thus twofold: ( i ) to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T

. e., possibly reflecting heritable variation in plant resistance, we next tested for population differences and SNP-based heritability in pest and microbiome read counts. Prior to these analyses, to avoid biases caused by different sequencing depths, we corrected the read counts for the total numbers of deduplicated reads in each library and used the residuals as unbiased estimates of aphid, mildew, and microbe loads ( see Materials and methods )

. e., reads not mapping to the target reference genome, as a source of information for quantifying herbivore and pathogen abundance in large collections. We worked with field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ), an annual plant in the Brassicaceae family that is increasingly studied as a model species ( Geng et al., 2021; Nunn et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Troyee et al., 2022; Galanti et al., 2022 ) and new biofuel and winter cover crop ( Dorn et al., 2015; Frels et al

., 2015; Kutyniok and Müller, 2012 ). Studying natural variation in plant resistance, along with associated genetic and epigenetic variation, can identify genes involved in defense and their regulators, including vital genes whose function cannot be determined through knockout experiments. Such knowledge, and especially the discovery of natural resistance alleles, are crucial sources for the breeding of more pest-resistant crop varieties

., 2015; Frels et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021 ). In a previous study, we investigated natural epigenetic variation in a collection of 207 Thlaspi lines from across Europe ( Galanti et al., 2022 ). Prior to their whole-genome ( WGS ) and -epigenome sequencing these lines had been grown in a common environment, an open glasshouse where the plants were spontaneously colonized by aphids and powdery mildew, as well as by other microbes

. arvense, and ( ii ) to explore whether non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions. Considering that we are moving toward an increasingly sequencing-prone world, with more and larger datasets being generated for many species ( Kajiya-Kanegae et al., 2021; Colgan et al., 2022; Habyarimana et al., 2022; Mekbib et al., 2022; Metheringham et al., 2022; Nocchi et al., 2022; Friis et al

. We therefore remapped all reads to the genomes of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, its endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola and the powdery mildew Blumeria graminis, and found that, on average, 7. 4% of the reads mapped to both T. arvense and at least one of the pests. We removed these ambiguous reads from our analyses and used only the T. arvense target reads, 92. 1% on average, for variant calling ( Figure 1A, Supplementary file 1 )

. thaliana and T. arvense upon aphid feeding, and in diploid wheat upon powdery mildew infection ( Geng et al., 2019; Annacondia et al., 2021; Troyee et al., 2022 ), but we also detected hypermethylation at several loci. M. persicae load was associated with differential methylation at only few genes but several TEs, which is in accordance with the aphid or stress-induced TE reactivation observed in A. thaliana ( Annacondia et al., 2021; Roquis et al., 2021 )

. Since many pest species are sensitive to climatic conditions, their pressure on plant communities is spatially heterogeneous, maintaining geographically structured genetic variation in plant defenses ( Züst et al., 2012; Kerwin et al., 2015 ). For these reasons, natural plant populations are highly suitable to study defense mechanisms and evolution of defenses, and also a very useful source of beneficial and resistance alleles for specific pathogens and environmental conditions

. It is not error-free, but we highlight some potential pitfalls, show how to reduce noise, and illustrate its potential to detect associations with climatic, genetic, and epigenetic variation. An important first step in our analyses was the identification and classification of pest-related reads in the plant WGS data. We began by classifying all reads as target ( only mapping to T. arvense ), ambiguous ( mapping to T

. To further investigate the genetic basis of variation in aphid, mildew, and microbe loads, we next employed GWA and tested for associations between exogenous read counts and biallelic genetic variants ( SNPs and short INDELs ). We corrected for population structure using an isolation by state ( IBS ) matrix and only tested variants with minor allele frequency ( MAF ) >0. 04 ( see Materials and methods ). Initially, we called genetic variants using all reads that mapped to the T

. Since glucosinolates are major defense metabolites of Brassicaceae, and their variation could thus be an explanation for variance in plant resistance, we also tested for correlations between the baseline amounts of these metabolites and the frequencies of aphid and mildew reads. Glucosinolate levels were measured on the same T. arvense lines in a separate experiment not affected by pests ( Supplementary file 7 )

. Based on these results, we concluded that the plants in our experiment had been attacked by M. persicae and E. cruciferarum. Finally, to compare the power of a large database approach ( MG-RAST ) vs. using specific reference genomes, we also remapped all exogenous reads to the M. persicae and B. aphidicola genome assemblies ( Singh et al., 2021 ) ( https://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/datasets/genome/GCF_001939165

., 2008; Keegan et al., 2016 ) or by confident mapping to specific pest genomes, and selected the 11 most relevant and/or abundant taxonomic groups to focus our analyses on. To obtain unbiased pest/microbe loads we also corrected the read counts for the total number of deduplicated reads of each sample. A competitive mapping approach allowed us to identify the aphid and mildew species that had occurred in our experiment as the generalist aphid M. persicae and the powdery mildew E

. Here, we describe how an unplanned pest infestation in a glasshouse experiment, together with available WGS data, can be used to estimate aphid, mildew, and microbial loads, and thus variation in plant resistance. The approach is straightforward, makes use of WGS data without microbiome-specific DNA extraction, and can in principle be applied to many other situations such as field experiments

. This phenotype-associated epigenetic variation can include both heritable and plastic components. The whole-genome bisulfite sequencing ( WGBS ) data from our previous study ( Gal et al. 202 ) were used to identify genetic variants associated with aphid, mildew, and microbe loads in T. arse lines. We also found differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular methylation at transpos and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, induced by pathogens. Our study provides insights into the defense mechanisms of T. arse, a crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities plant biotic interactions. With increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug, have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations. In this study, we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ). We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors. We focus on one compound, TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In six selections with TCMDC-125334, the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we did identify one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus. These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Finally, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme.

   ., 2015 ). We have also previously shown that collateral sensitivity occurs during the evolution of resistance to Plasmodium DHODH inhibitors. Mutations in dhodh conferring resistance to one inhibitor can alter the enzyme such that it becomes more sensitive to inhibition by other, structurally distinct compounds ( Lukens et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2014 )

., 2018 ). In this study, we test the hypothesis that combining two DHODH inhibitors based on their collateral sensitivity profiles would suppress the emergence of resistant parasites. We focused on the compound TCMDC-125334, a DHODH inhibitor that exhibited increased activity against all mutant lines tested, including those that arose during selection with the clinical candidate DSM265

The main conclusion of our study is that combining two DHODH inhibitors, DSM265 and TCDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles fails to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro. Although all previously identified mutations that we tested exhibited sensitivity to TCMDC-125334, we identified the point mutation DHODH I263S in selection with TCMDC-125334 alone, which was resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265

. While sequentially selected parasites with additional mutations in dhodh were highly resistant to DSM265, they were not cross-resistant to TCMDC-125334, suggesting that they would still be sensitive to a therapeutic dose. We wanted to further characterize how the DHODH C276Y and DHODH F227Y mutations were interacting to contribute to the observed dose-response phenotypes

. We found that sequentially treating a collaterally sensitive mutant line with TCMDC-125334 selected for parasites with additional genetic changes in dhodh, including the DHODH F227Y mutation, which alone also confers resistance to TCMDC-125334. While the DHODH C276Y/F227Y double mutant is less sensitive than the DHODH C276Y parent, it is still more sensitive to TCMDC-125334 compared to wildtype parasites

. Additionally, understanding the pathways and susceptibility to drug resistance is important to assess next-generation antimalarials, ideally while they are still early in the development process. Inhibitors targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) offer an illustrative example. DHODH is an electron transport chain protein that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate in orotic acid, which is the rate-limiting step of pyrimidine biosynthesis

. The major take-away of this study is that combination treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 failed to suppress resistance, and we hypothesize that this is due to the great diversity of evolutionarily competitive dhodh mutations that confer resistance to various inhibitors. Other reports in bacteria have also found that observed patterns of collateral sensitivity are often thwarted due to the existence of diverse trajectories to resistance

., 2014 ), or simultaneously in combination to slow or suppress the evolution of resistance ( Gonzales et al., 2015; Munck et al., 2014; Rodriguez de Evgrafov et al., 2015 ). Collateral sensitivity to various classes of inhibitors targeting Plasmodium parasites has also been observed

., 2014; Ross et al., 2014 ). The existence of collateral sensitivity among a wide range of antimalarial inhibitors suggests a promising opportunity to exploit this phenomenon to block the emergence of resistant parasites ( Lukens et al., 2014 ). In an effort to expand this work, we screened antimalarial libraries from GSK, and successfully identified several compounds with increased activities against DHODH mutants relative to wildtype parasites ( Ross et al., 2018 )

. 3-fold more sensitive than the wildtype parent, to DHODH C276Y, which is 12-fold sensitive. In contrast, all mutant lines were at least 10-fold resistant to DSM265 ( Figure 1C ). While none of the mutations in dhodh conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334, we previously reported that this compound appears to exclusively target the DHODH enzyme

. In Phase 2 clinical trials with DSM265, 2 out of 24 patients failed treatment due to resistance, with recrudescent parasites harboring mutations in dhodh including DHODH C276Y, C276F, and G181S ( Llanos-Cuentas et al., 2018 ). The C276Y and C276F mutations were also observed in in vitro resistance selections, as was DHODH G181C ( Phillips et al., 2015; Mandt et al., 2019; White et al., 2019 )

Previously, we screened GSK chemical libraries from the Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set for activity against either wildtype or DHODH mutant parasites ( Supplementary file 1a; Ross et al., 2018 ). In an extended cross-resistance analysis, we characterized the activity of 17 compounds against three additional DHODH mutant lines, DHODH C276Y, DHODH F227L, and DHODH F227L/L531F ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—source data 1 )

. One implication of these results is that targeting this enzyme with antimalarial drugs has a high risk of resistance emergence and brings into question the usefulness of pursuing further DHODH inhibitors.

. Finally, we found that treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 in combination selected for cross-resistant parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation. We also demonstrated that the DHODH V532A mutation does not exhibit a fitness cost in in vitro competitive growth assays. While we identified three point mutations in this study that confer resistance to TCMDC-125334, the majority of dhodh mutations tested thus far are sensitive to this molecule

. In Plasmodium, this reaction is dependent on flavin mononucleotide and ubiquinone cofactors and is coupled to mitochondrial respiration. Because Plasmodium lacks pyrimidine scavenging pathways, this enzyme is essential for parasite growth and survival ( Phillips and Rathod, 2010 ). Multiple high-throughput screens have identified DHODH as a drug target in Plasmodium falciparum ( Baldwin et al., 2005; Pavadai et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2018; Phillips et al

. Clonal lines isolated from flask 1 had two- or threefold copy number variation ( CNV ) encompassing the dhodh locus, which corresponded to a two- or three-fold resistance phenotype to TCMDC-125334, as well as to the structurally distinct DHODH inhibitors DSM265, Genz669178, and IDI6273

. The emergence of resistance in Plasmodium parasite populations and subsequent treatment failure has been documented for all antimalarial drugs in clinical use, including frontline artemisinin combination therapies ( Haldar et al., 2018 ). Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop a next generation of drugs targeting distinct vulnerabilities of Plasmodium parasites

. However, our results suggest that treatment with a second compound can also result in the acquisition of additional genetic changes and subsequent multidrug resistance. Comparing the phenotype of the DHDOH C276Y/F227Y double mutant with DHODH C276Y and DHODH F227Y parasite lines, we also note that the double mutant is less sensitive to TDCM-334 than DHOD C276 but more sensitive than DHF227.
A novel compartmental model was developed to investigate the relationship between malaria transmission intensity and drug resistance. The model tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study underscores the critical role of malaria diversity in biogeographic patterns of resistance. Strain diversity has not been explicitly considered in mathematical models of drug resistance, yet orders of magnitude differentiate antigen diversity of Plasium falcum strains among bioge zones drive differences in epidemiological features. The model implies control should vary from region to region, and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. Inclusion of diversity provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's persisting resistance to antimal drugs, including chlorquine, despite lower transmission than Africa. In regions with low diversity, parasites cannot reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections often. The model shows that diversity and strain-specific immunity, tracked through macarasitic structure, predict the complex relationship between transmission and drug frequencies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cannabis, the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world, is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ). We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. 

    Supporting Text:
    To model the impact of early Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic events, we first tested three distinct developmental windows: ( 1 ) exposure of ESCs, ( 2 ) exposure of EpiLCs, and ( 3 ) combined ESCs +EpiLCs exposure ( Figure 1A ). Cells were either exposed to the vehicle ( mock ) or exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0. 1 nM-100µM, corresponding to the reported physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users ( Fuchs Weizman et al., 2021; Hunault et al

. Together, our studies reveal a moderate but significant impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic processes. Our work also highlights the importance of the metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages.

., 2011; Yao et al., 2022 ). In particular, the extensive metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic reprogramming that PGCs undergo during their development has been proposed to be uniquely sensitive to environmental insults, with potential consequences in the offspring ( Verdikt et al., 2022 ). Here, we deployed this in vitro differentiation system to investigate the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early developmental stages

., 2008 ). Differential expression and use of cannabinoid receptors on the surface of exposed cells have been shown to correlate with Δ9-THC proliferative phenotypes ( Galve-Roperh et al., 2013; Preet et al., 2008; Takeda et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016 ). However, our experiments demonstrated that despite being required for Δ9-THC-induced proliferation in ESCs, CB1 expression did not significantly differ at the surface of ESCs and EpiLCs

., 2022 ). Using a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating in the differentiation of PGCLCs, our study is the first to shed light on the impact of Δ9-THC at these stages which unfold during the first trimester in humans ( Chabarria et al., 2016; Volkow et al., 2019; Young-Wolff et al., 2018 )

. This in turn could have adverse consequences on cell-cell adhesion with an impact on PGC normal development in vivo. Despite epidemiological evidence of cannabis exposure in parents being associated with adverse effects in the offspring ( Smith et al., 2020; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018 ), the molecular mechanisms involved in the inheritance of exposure have not been extensively studied. In vitro models for germ cell development offer a unique opportunity for such studies ( Verdikt et al

., 2019 ). The psychoactive effects of Δ9-THC arise from its binding and subsequent activation of the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor CB1 largely expressed in the central nervous system ( Pacher et al., 2020 ). In this context, Δ9-THC exposure has been shown to durably alter metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic programs in the brain ( Bénard et al., 2012; Prini et al., 2018; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018; Watson et al., 2015 )

. We demonstrate that exposure of ESCs and EpiLCs to Δ9-THC durably alters their metabolome. We reveal that, in the absence of continuous exposure, metabolic memory of Δ9-THC is passed onto the PGCLCs stage leading to transcriptional defects in these cells. Together, our findings highlight the role of metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism for early developmental Δ9-THC exposure.

. We next determined whether the Δ9-THC-induced proliferative phenotype in ESCs was due to the engagement of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. To do so, ESCs were pretreated for 1 hr with 1 μM of SR141716 ( also known as rimonabant, a specific CB1 blocker [Rinaldi-Carmona et al., 1994] ) then exposed to 100 nM or 100 µM of Δ9-THC for 48 hr

. In particular, between 7% and 12% of expecting women report cannabis use, predominantly during the first trimester, to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness ( Chabarria et al., 2016; Volkow et al., 2019; Young-Wolff et al., 2018 ). These statistics indicate that a significant number of developing embryos are exposed to cannabis, with limited knowledge of the biological repercussions of such exposure

. Data shows that no ∆9-THC could be detected in day 5 embryoid bodies, indicating that ∆9-THC does not persist to levels higher than the limit of detection of mass spectrometry ( 1 ng/mL ). This suggests that the proliferative effects are not due to residual ∆9-THC persisting in the cells during differentiation towards PGCLCs. Thus, Δ9-THC causes an alteration of the developmental kinetics that PGCLCs normally undergo, even in the absence of direct continuous exposure

., 2015 ). While over the last decades, significant attention has been paid to Δ9-THC’s neurological effects, there is also evidence, albeit more limited, of its impact on reproductive functions ( Lo et al., 2022 ). Data shows CB1 expression in the male and the female reproductive tracts, in the pre-implantation embryo and in the placenta ( Lo et al., 2022; Paria et al., 1995 )

., 2022; Paria et al., 1995 ). In animal models as well as in humans, exposure to cannabis is associated with reduced fertility, decreased testis weight and sperm count, and impairment of embryo implantation ( Lo et al., 2022 ). In males, these effects are correlated with an alteration of the sperm transcriptome and epigenome ( Murphy et al., 2018; Osborne et al., 2020; Schrott and Murphy, 2020 )

. We next sought to understand the source of variation in proliferative outcomes in response to Δ9-THC between naive mouse embryonic stem cells and primed pluripotent epiblast-like cells. Such differential effects have been previously reported, with Δ9-THC eliciting the proliferation of neural progenitors ( Galve-Roperh et al., 2013 ) and of human breast carcinoma cell lines ( Takeda et al., 2008 ) but suppressing the proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells ( Yang et al

With greater social acceptance and legalization, cannabis use has increased worldwide ( Mennis et al., 2023; U. N Office on Drugs and Crime, 2022 ). Yet, the impact of such heightened use on reproductive functions, and in particular, on the earliest developmental stages is not well understood. Cannabis use directly alters adult male fertility and causes abnormal embryo implantation ( Lo et al., 2022 )

., 2011; Kittler et al., 2000 ). Cell-cell adhesion is crucial in PGCs’ formation both in cell culture systems ( Okamura et al., 2003 ) as well as in vivo where it controls PGCs motility during their migration towards the developing somatic gonad ( Barton et al., 2016 ). Our results thus show that exposure to Δ9-THC prior to specification affects embryonic germ cells’ transcriptome and metabolome

. Together, our analysis of ESCs and EpiLCs transcriptomes reveals a difference in the response of these stem cell populations to Δ9-THC exposure: the transcriptional alterations observed in ESCs supported their increased anabolism and proliferation, whereas changes in EpiLCs gene expression did not correlate with their metabolic changes

. Notably, SR141716 pre-treatment, while not altering cell viability, abolished the proliferative effect of Δ-THC in ESCs. This indicates that the CB1 receptor is required for Δ-TH-induced proliferation in naive embryonic stem cells but not in primed epiblast-like cells.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes, but similar studies are rare in animals. The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, we identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection.

   ., 2014; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). However, even in mice one NLR ( Nlrp1 ) has different copy numbers in different laboratory strains, ranging from 2 to 5 ( Lilue et al., 2018 ). In many fishes, studies have reported NLR repertoires in the range of 10–50 genes ( e. g., Rajendran et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016 ). In others, hundreds of NLRs are present, including in the model species zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) ( Stein et al., 2007; Laing et al., 2008; Tørresen et al

. In general, the fact that hundreds of NLR gene copies are maintained in zebrafish, together with a signature of purifying selection, suggests that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. Although the expression of fish NLRs is often induced by pathogen exposure ( reviewed in Chuphal et al., 2022 ), the exact function of most zebrafish NLR-C genes remains unclear

We have previously demonstrated a substantial reduction in single-nucleotide variation in zebrafish laboratory strains compared to wild populations ( Suurväli et al., 2020 ). Here, we showed that the copy numbers of the NLRome and their variation are also heavily reduced. The most obvious explanation for this observation is the recent population bottleneck which marks the establishment of laboratory strains

. The sheer amount of copy number variation that appears to be present in a single gene family of zebrafish is staggering, with different individuals each having numerous genes that are not present in all others. This can only be caused by diversity-generating mechanisms that are active even now. In this study, we have laid the groundwork for future studies investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large, vertebrate gene families.

. 2 sequences, 880 FISNA-NACHT and 346 NLR-B30. 2 ( 59 and 57%, respectively ) were detected in at least one individual from all wild populations ( Figure 3B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). There were also NLR sequences shared between just two wild populations, and some were restricted to a single population ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, we observed a lot of variability in the distributions of gene copies among fish within populations ( Figure 3C )

. There are at least two mechanisms which could contribute to the extensive copy number variation seen among zebrafish populations: first, it could be attributed to a high degree of haplotypic variation. Large DNA fragments contain different sets of genes and gene copies, similar to the zebrafish MHC loci ( McConnell et al., 2014 ). Extensive haplotypic variation occurs on the long arm of chromosome 4, the location containing over two-thirds of all NLRs in zebrafish ( McConnell et al

. Although structural similarities of NLRs in plants and animals are thought to be the result of convergent evolution ( Yue et al., 2012 ), it appears that the similarities extend to their evolutionary trajectories. However, the overall number of gene copies as well as the variation in copy numbers within populations and in individual gene repertoires are more extreme in zebrafish than in A. thaliana

. We found each individual zebrafish to have 100–550 NLR genes from the pan-NLRome in at least one copy ( Figures 2 and 3 ), and only 50–75% of these have a high-quality match in the GRCz11 reference genome ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). In general, laboratory zebrafish had less NLRs than wild samples ( Figure 2 ). The number and length of CCS reads and assembled contigs ( both prior to orthology clustering ) are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1

. A comparable situation can be found in the NLR genes of the thale cress ( A. thaliana ). Our predicted number of NLRs in a zebrafish population is on the same scale as the 2127 NLRs found in the thale cress NLRome ( Van de Weyer et al., 2019b ). Moreover, copy numbers also vary greatly between A. thaliana accessions ( Lee and Chae, 2020 ). A total of 464 conserved, high-confidence orthogroups were identified in A

., 2023; Zarrei et al., 2015 ). One example of the latter is the MHC locus, which harbors varying numbers of gene copies between closely related species of ruminants ( He et al., 2024 ) and has haplotype-specific copies in mice ( Lilue et al., 2018 ). However, the vast number of NLRs in zebrafish combined with presence/absence variation ( McConnell et al., 2023 ) and high rates of duplication exceeds what has been found in other animals so far

., 2007; Laing et al., 2008; Tørresen et al., 2018; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). The zebrafish reference genome contains nearly 400 NLR genes, two-thirds of which are located on the putative sex chromosome ( chromosome 4 ), in a genomic region associated with extensive haplotypic variation ( Howe et al., 2013; Howe et al., 2016; McConnell et al., 2023; Anderson et al., 2012 )

., 2023; Anderson et al., 2012 ). The majority of fish NLRs represent a fish-specific subtype that was originally labeled NLR-C ( Laing et al., 2008 ), although they can be further divided into at least six groups based on structural similarities and sequence of conserved exons ( Howe et al., 2016; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020 ). A schematic structure of proteins encoded by zebrafish NLR-C genes is presented in Figure 1A

. The reduction in copy number variation in the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) locus in a population of greater prairie-chicken was attributed to a recent bottleneck as well ( Eimes et al., 2011 ). Additionally, the reduced amount of pathogenic challenges in a laboratory environment could lead to a steady loss of expendable genes. For these reasons, one has to exercise caution when extending conclusions from immune-related studies on laboratory zebrafish to wild zebrafish

., 2009; Howe et al., 2016; Suurväli et al., 2022 ) that are often also involved in immunity. It is not known why fishes possess so many NLRs, how they evolve, and how much within-species genetic variability they have. The previously observed repeated expansions and contractions of this family suggest it to have a high rate of gene birth and death ( Suurväli et al., 2022 )

. thaliana, 106–143 of which were defined as the core NLRome because they were found in a subset comprising at least 80% of the accessions ( Van de Weyer et al., 2019b ). In wild zebrafish, we found a set of 880 NLR genes which were detected in at least one individual from three wild populations, but only 58 NLRs were found in the vast majority ( more than 80% ) of wild individuals

. Thus, there is considerable variation in the NLR repertoires of individuals from the same population. The total number of NLRs identified in a number x of individual fish can be fitted to a harmonic function ( Medini et al., 2020 ). Using this function ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ), we estimated the sizes of the NLRomes of the populations ( Figure 3D ) and found a total of 520 and 570 NLRs in the laboratory strains TU and CGN, respectively ( Table 1 )

. Furthermore, each NLR had its own distinct pattern of presence/absence in the populations ( Figure 3 ), with some shared between two populations and others restricted to a single population ( Figure 3 ). We also observed a lot of variability in the distribution of gene copies among fish within populations ( Figure 3 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.

   ., 2015 ). Lacking wings as integumentary outgrowths, the earliest ovules in the Famennian ( 372–359 million years ago [Ma], Late Devonian ) rarely played a role in wind dispersal ( Rowe, 1997 ). Furthermore, nearly all Famennian ovules are cupulate, i. e., borne in a protecting and pollinating cupule ( Prestianni et al., 2013; Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2018 )

. The earliest ovules in the Famennian of Late Devonian, usually preserved to be unconnected with branches, are mostly devoid of integumentary wings and enclosed in cupules; they are thus insufficiently known for integument function and wind dispersal. New ovule Alasemenia in this paper terminates leafless branches, bears three wings and lacks cupules. It represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famennian

. Alasemenia, Guazia, and Warsteinia suggest that the evolutionarily novel wings, as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind, appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages. Other wind dispersal mechanisms including plumes, pappi and parachutes of seeds appeared later in the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic, respectively ( Axsmith et al., 2013 )

. et sp. nov. It occurs in Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron ( Wang et al., 2019 ). The terminally borne ovules are three-winged and clearly acupulate, thus implying additional or novel functions of integument. Based on current fossil evidence and mathematical analysis, we discuss the evolution of winged seeds and compare the wind dispersal of seeds with different number of wings.

. Besides protective and pollinating functions, Alasemenia suggests photosynthetically nutritive and anemochorous functions of early ovules. It indicates the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings. Compared to Famennian four-winged ovules of Warsteinia and Guazia, Alasemenia with three distally outwards extending wings shows advantage in anemochory. Mathematical analysis implies that three-winged ovules could be efficiently dispersed by wind.

Since plants colonized the land, wind dispersal ( anemochory ) became common with the seed wing representing a key dispersal strategy through geological history ( Taylor et al., 2009; Ma, 2009; McLoughlin and Pott, 2019 ). Winged seeds evolved numerous times in many lineages of extinct and extant seed plants ( spermatophytes ) ( Schenk, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2015 )

., 2013 ). Current evidence indicates that seeds with three or four wings occurred first in the Late Devonian. They were followed by two- or three-winged seeds in the Carboniferous ( Long, 1960; Long, 1969 ), and then by single-winged seeds in the Permian ( Stevenson et al., 2015; Prevec et al., 2008 ). Relating to wind dispersal, the diaspores ( seeds/fruits ) of living spermatophytes possess multiple mechanisms and variable number of wings ( Ma, 2009 )

. However, the ovule of Warsteinia remains unclear in attachment to branches and possession of a cupule. Alasemenia confirms that, like Guazia, the integuments of acupulate ovules developed a new function in wind dispersal. In the Late Devonian ovules, besides Alasemenia, both Warsteinia ( Rowe, 1997 ) and Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ) possess integumentary lobes forming radially arranged wings

. The surface of integuments is enlarged through the outgrowths of wings and thus promotes the photosynthesis. Little is known about the dispersal function of Famennian ovules, because the integumentary wings as a derived character have been rarely documented. Warsteinia ( Rowe, 1997 ), Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ) and now Alasemenia indicate that the anemochory originated in the Famennian

. In addition, three-winged seeds have the most stable area of windward, which also ensures the motion stability in wind dispersal. Significantly, the maximum windward area of each wing of Alasemenia is greater than that of Guazia and Warsteinia with four wings. All these factors suggest that Alasemenia is well adapted for anemochory

. The generic name from the Latin ‘ala’ and ‘semen’, meaning wing and seed, respectively; the specific epithet from the Latin ‘tri’ ( three ), referring to wing number of a seed. PKUB21721a, b ( part and counterpart housed in Department of Geology, Peking University, Beijing ) ( Figure 1a, m and n ). Xinhang, Guangde, Anhui, China; Leigutai Member of Wutong Formation, Upper Devonian. Dichotomous branches bearing terminal and acupulate ovules

. These ovules are usually surrounded by cupules. Now, as in Guazia, the ovules of Alasemenia terminate the dichotomous branches and are transversely sectioned to show the ovular structures. The ovules of these two genera provide rare evidence for acupulate ovules in the earliest seed plants. Both cupule and integument of an early ovule perform the protective and pollinating functions ( Meyer-Berthaud, 2022 )

Except few taxa including Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ), Dorinnotheca ( Fairon-Demaret, 1996 ), Cosmosperma ( Liu et al., 2017 ), Elkinsia ( Serbet and Rothwell, 1992 ) and Moresnetia ( Fairon-Demaret and Scheckler, 1987 ), the earliest ovules in the Late Devonian ( Famennian ) have not been preserved to be connected to the branches. These ovules are usually surrounded by cupules

. Compared to Warsteinia with short and straight wings and Guazia with long but distally inwards curving wings, Alasemenia with longer and outwards extending wings would efficiently reduce the rate of descent and be more capably moved by wind. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis in mathematics indicates that three-winged ovules such as Alasemenia are more adapted to wind dispersal than four-winged ovules including Warsteinia and Guazia ( see following )

., 2019; Gao et al., 2022 ). From many horizons of siltstone and mudstone of Wutong Formation ( Leigutai Member ) at Jianchuan mine, numerous ovules of Alasemenia were collected ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 ) and some were transversely sectioned to show the ovular structure ( Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 5 )

. Since the broad integumentary wings well extend outwards, the wing loading of Alasemenia is obviously less than that of Guazia. When the winged seeds fall in the air, the predictable spinning can lead to the reduction of fall rate, and result in the increase of the horizontal dispersal distance. This has been observed in the field experiments or proved in the modelling reconstruction experiments ( Green, 1980; Habgood et al., 1998 )

., 2013; Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2018 ). Warsteinia was a Famennian ovule with four integumentary wings, but its attachment and cupule remain unknown ( Rowe, 199 ). Guia was a Famenn ovule with integary outgrowths and cupule ( Wang et al., 202 ). Alas is a Famenn ovule with three integary outgrow and no cupule.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.

   . In this study, we report that RAPSYN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia and promotes disease progression, presumably by stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein via neddylation. The neddylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN subsequently competes its ubiquitination-dependent degradation to increase the stability of BCR-ABL

In this study, we identified a novel role of RAPSYN in hematology. Indeed, RAPSYN inhibition significantly suppressed the survival of Ph+ leukemia. This phenotype was found to be linked to the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN, which mediated BCR-ABL neddylation to enhance its stability for promoting leukemogenesis. Balanced protein synthesis and degradation are pivotal for maintaining protein homeostasis and normal cellular function

. It is well known that the generation of BCR-ABL fusion protein is a decisive characteristic of Ph+ leukemia ( de Klein et al., 1982 ). Aside from the occurrence of RAPSYN in patients with Ph+ leukemia, the present study revealed a fascinating finding that BCR-ABL expression levels were correlated with those of RAPSYN, demonstrating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL

. In summary, our work has uncovered the pivotal role that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. More importantly, our results shed a light on future investigations that may help to extend to other cancer types for broadening our understanding of RAPSYN’s involvement in hematology and oncology.

. Consequently, the survival of tumor-bearing mice was profoundly prolonged by the knockout of RAPSN compared to the controls ( Figure 1K ). Altogether, our findings indicate that RAPSYN is highly expressed at protein level with the accordance to BCR-ABL in Ph+ leukemia and its depletion results in inhibiting the progression of Ph+ leukemia

. Therefore, RAPSYN phosphorylation at Y336 by SRC was a major contributing factor to its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity and BCR-ABL stability in Ph+ leukemia cells. To assess the extent to which SRC-mediated phosphorylation of RAPSYN at Y336 contributes to the enhanced viability of RAPSYN-dependent Ph+ leukemia cells, we first identified a specific shSRC by screening five candidates using toxicity tests and then performing rescue experiments with SRC cDNA

. To test this hypothesis, reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed to reveal a strong interaction between RAPSYN and BCR-ABL in Ph+ leukemia cells ( Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ). Similar results were obtained with exogenous expression in HEK293T cells ( Figure 2B ), further confirming the specific interaction of RAPSYN with BCR-ABL

. Moreover, as a new type of PTM for BCR-ABL, RAPSYN-mediated neddylation was found to compete c-CBL-mediated ubiquitination, causing a reduction in BCR-ABL degradation. Given the fact that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance and LIC population in patients with Ph+ leukemia ( Issaad et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 2005 ), effective degradation of BCR-ABL is an alternative opportunity for the treatment

. In addition, we also examined mRNA levels of RAPSYN-related neddylation enzymes, including E1 ( NAE1 ), E2 ( UBE2M ), NEDD8, and NEDP1, in above GSE databases, and no significant differences of these neddylation-related genes were found between CML patients and healthy donors as well ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ). On the basis of the co-expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL, we postulated that RAPSYN could specifically mediate neddylation of BCR-ABL to promote Ph+ leukemia development

. This co-expression of RAPSYN and BCR-ABL was also found in Ph+ cell lines ( Figure 1B ), suggesting that the function of RAPSYN in Ph+ leukemia could be closely related to BCR-ABL. To examine the relationship between RAPSYN and Ph+ leukemia progression, we first performed knockdown of its expression by using shRNAs

. Whereas notable cytotoxicity following marked reduction of RAPSYN was observed in all tested Ph+ leukemia cell lines and CML patient PBMCs ( Figure 1C, D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F ), transduction with the shRNA for RAPSN did not affect cell viability of RAPSYN- and BCR-ABL-negative HS-5 cells, indicating the dependence on the presence and expression level of BCR-ABL. Conversely, exogenous expression of RAPSN rescued Ph+ leukemia cells from shRNA-generated toxicity ( Figure 1E )

. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the inhibition of RAPSYN expression could lead to cytotoxicity in Ph+ leukemia with high specificity and marginal side effects. Furthermore, our present results showed that knockdown of RAPSYN significantly increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to saracatinib, implying that a combination of RAPSYN inhibition and TKI treatment can effectively control mutations and LIC-derived TKI resistance in Ph+ leukemia

. These results were supported by stronger neddylation of endogenous BCR-ABL in cells overexpressing WT RAPSN, but not in the Y336F mutant ( Figure 5E ). Furthermore, protein turnover rates of BCR-ABL were determined in Ph+ leukemia cells and the cells with exogenous RAPSNY336F expression displayed larger decrease in BCR-ABL level than those expressing RAPSNWT ( Figure 5F )

., 2021 ). Based on its oncogenic role in Ph+ leukemia, BCR-ABL has been regarded as the most pivotal target for Ph+ leukemia therapy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have been the main treatment option for Ph+ leukemia, remarkably prolonging the patients’ lifespan and improving their quality of life ( Hochhaus et al., 2020; Jabbour and Kantarjian, 2020 )

. As decreased neddylation of BCR-ABL following either MLN4924 treatment or RAPSN KO was accompanied by a strong decline in its overall protein expression level ( Figures 2G and 3A, B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), we asked whether RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation affects protein stability. Subsequently, the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX was applied to K562 cells transduced with vectors encoding doxycycline-inducible RAPSN shRNA #3

. In contrast, expression of exogenous RAPSNY336F attenuated the protective effects of SRC inhibition to a much lesser extent ( Figure 6H–J ). Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation at Y336 by SRC is a major event in the pro-leukemogenic functions of RAPSYN in Ph+ leukemia development.

., 2019; Xing et al., 2020 ). In this study, we found that RAPSYN promotes disease progression by neddylating BCR-ABL for its resistance to c-CBL-mediated proteasomal degradation. Additionally, its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity was increased by SRC-mediated phosphorylation. Previously, the residue Y86 in RAPSYN was identified as a phosphorylation site by muscle-associated receptor tyrosine kinase ( MuSK ) at the neuromuscular junction endplate ( Xing et al

. Meanwhile, immunoblotting of tumor samples showed a notable downregulation of RAPSYN expression, which was associated with a decrease in B-ABL protein levels ( Figure 3C, Figure 3— supplement 1 ), suggesting that RSY-mediated nedlation of B-ABL is crucial for its stability in Ph+ leukemia.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.

   . Considering the fact that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria usually contain antimicrobial peptide-like regions ( Vázquez et al., 2021 ), in the present work, we report a new strategy to mine active bactericidal peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes through lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming screening. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully discovered the two peptidoglycan hydrolases PHAb10 and PHAb11 from the proteome of A

., 2016; Li et al., 2021 ). These observations prompted us to consider whether antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologs could be mined from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template. As a proof-of-concept, we here used the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015 ) as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases from the A. baumannii proteome database ( PHAbs, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

Since a variety of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria are shown to harbor an N- or C-terminal antimicrobial peptide, this led us to speculate that antimicrobial peptide could be used as template to mine new peptidoglycan hydrolases. To prove this hypothesis, P307, a well-documented antimicrobial peptide against A. baumannii from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015; Thandar et al., 2016 ), was used as the template to mine putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from A

. Putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from the A. baumannii ( PHAbs ) proteome database were obtained by BLASTP in NCBI using the lysin PlyF307-derived antimicrobial peptide P307 as input sequence. Sequences marked as partial, shorter than 110 amino acids, longer than 300 amino acids, or clearly not belonging to lysins were manually excluded from further analysis. Multiple sequence alignments were performed by the ClustalW algorithm in MEGAX software and visualized by Jalview

. This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy is feasible for discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes.

The uncontrollable spread and emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires the discovery of new antimicrobial agents with different targets or mechanisms of action than traditional antibiotics. Bacteriophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) have been investigated as promising alternatives to combat resistant bacteria due to their unique mechanism of action, potent bactericidal activity, low risk of drug resistance development

. 1 from clade III, WP_000109885. 1 from clade IV, and WP_032023242. 1 from clade V were shortlisted and renamed as PHAb11, PHAb10, PHAb9, PHAb8, and PHAb7, respectively, for further investigation ( Figure 1b ). Further homology analysis revealed that these five peptidoglycan hydrolases showed great diversity with the structured AcLys lysin and the original PlyF307 lysin ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2b )

. To test the activity of these PHAbs, their coding sequences were chemically synthesized, cloned into a vector, and expressed in E. coli cells. As expected, all five PHAbs were well expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) with high purity ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1a ). Next, we examined the hydrolytic activity of these five PHAbs on peptidoglycan derived from A. baumannii 3437 by a halo assay ( Vander Elst et al., 2020 )

., 2020 ). However, compared with the current progress in the clinical translation of lysins against Gram-positive bacteria, the discovery of lysins against Gram-negative bacteria that meet the needs described in the WHO priority pathogen list is still urgently needed ( Briers and Lavigne, 2015; Lai et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases has also been hampered by limited sources of published phage genome data

. baumannii using the PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template, highlighting the utility of this strategy in mining antimicrobial agents from bacterial database. Notably, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited high bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes. Unlike other Gram-negative lysins that act in an outer membrane permeabilizer-dependent manner ( Briers et al., 2011; Walmagh et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2014; Plotka et al

. To understand the catalytic mechanism and thermal stability of these peptidoglycan hydrolases, we attempted to decipher their structures and eventually obtained the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 by X-ray crystallography ( Supplementary file 1b ). Results showed that PHAb8 was a monomer ( Figure 4a; Figure 4—figure supplement 1a ), while PHAb10 ( Figure 4b ) and PHAb11 ( Figure 4c ) formed an asymmetric dimer

. The coding sequences of the original five putative peptidoglycan hydrolases, namely, PHAb7, PHAb8, PHAb9, PHAb10, and PHAb11, as well as the PHAb10 variant, PHAb10-mut, with six site mutations were chemically synthesized with codon optimization and cloned into a pET28b ( + ) vector by NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. Additional variants of PHAb10 and truncations of PHAb10 and PHAb11 were constructed by primer-derived overlap PCR ( Supplementary file 1g )

. To this end, we evaluated the effects of different truncations of PHAb10 and PHAb11 on different bacteria by halo assay to test their peptidoglycan hydrolase activity

. In contrast, PHAb7, PHAb8, and PHAb9 completely lost their activity after treatment at 70°C for 1 hr ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1e ). Together, these observations showed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 were highly thermostable peptidoglycan hydrolases with a broad spectrum of action. Due to the natural barrier of the outer membrane, several peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e

. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. Encouragingly, these PHAbs were active against peptidoglycans from all strains tested and formed a clear halo ( Figure 2a ). Among these PHAbs, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed larger size of clear zones under each concentration tested ( Figure 2a ), indicating that these two PHAbs might have stronger peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity. To prove this, we further evaluated the bactericidal activity of these PHAbs against each isolate of A

. Structural prediction analysis showed that PHAb10 contains a putative lysozyme catalytic domain ( amino acids 1–110, P10-Lys ) and a C-terminal cationic peptide ( amino acids 111–149, P10-CP ), whereas PHAb11 contains an N-terminal cationic peptide with unknown function ( amino acids 1–36, P11-NP ), followed by a putative lysozyme catalytic domain ( amino acids 37–145, P11-Lys, with 68

. Results showed that PH10 and PH11 exhibited potent bactericidal activity against A. baumanni, P aeruginosa, and E coli even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr ( Figure 3 ), while PH7, PH8, and PH9 were thermosensitive ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). The crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved by X-ray crystallography ( Supplementary 1 ) and showed that PH8 was a monomer while PH10 and PH11 formed an asymmetric dimer ( Figure 4; Figure 4— supplement 1 and 2 ). Mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10 ( Figure 5 ). In conclusion, our antimicrobial-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs

The crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved by X-ray crystallography ( Supplementary 1 ) and showed that PH8 was a monomer ( Figure 4; Figure— supplement 1 ) while PH10 and PH11 formed an asymmetric dimer ( Figure 4 Figure— supplement 1 and 2 ). Mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10 ( Figure 5 ) In conclusion, our antimicrobial-prim strategy provides new clues for the discovery of antimicrobial drugs

A retrospective study of 6.9 million patients from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) from 1994 to 2018 identified 23,592 patients with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Cancer Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement the registry codes, a text mining approach was used to extract symptoms from free clinical notes in electronic health records of 307 pancreatic patients and 30,780 controls. Both sources were used to generate and compare symptom trajectories to uncover patterns prior to pancreatic diagnosis. The text mining of clinical notes captured more symptoms before diagnosis than the registry-based analysis, including 'blood pressure without diagnosis', 'abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction'. Trajectories identified two groups with lower survival <90 days: 'CoughJaiceIntestinal' and 'painJaiceAbnormal function'. The study provides a comparison of two types of pancreatic symptom trajectories, which can leverage the full potential of health data and provide a fuller picture of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.

The study also included text vocabulary of known pancreatic symptoms and compared disease trajectories using registry and EHRs to characterize the ordering of symptoms. Statistically significant trajectories were found prior to pancreatic that may be assessed as risk factors for screening. Symptoms were more abundant in EHRs than NPR. Future applications can use AI and text techniques to build longitudinal trajectories for early prediction in clinics, serving as a guide for screening and improving lives of patients. The study shows phenotypic information in registry and free EHR can detect patterns prior pancreatic diagnosis, revealing an increase in prevalence in EHR suggesting harnessing complete data by multi-modality trajectories.

A total of 93% of pancreatic patients in notes had at least one symptom by mining. A control group of 30,780 was generated by matching year, age and sex. From 25,085 had at least one symptom from general dictionary combining ICD-10 chapter 18, known cancer literature, and clinical notes. Text identified 73 unique symptoms for cancer and 79 for control. This provides a comprehensive representation of symptomatology, enabling assessment and detection. The study underscores importance of comprehensive assessment for prediction and outcomes in pancreatic.

The study detected symptoms using single-disease approach, not considering ordering. This paper presents a large-scale investigation of symptoms longitudinally covering ICD terminology chapter 18. Codes from ICD 10 at level 3 were used. The cohort was based on pancreatic code C25. Only patients with confirmed diagnosis in Danish Registry were included. More than 2000 had 'pain' in text notes but less than 500 in registry. Contrary, some were more in NPR than notes. Trajectories detected in longer group (>90).

    Title: 
    Abstract: The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12. 5–16 Hz, adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0. 5–1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years, and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups—but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood.

   . To obtain evidence for two distinct dominant oscillatory spindle rhythms within all four age groups ( 5- to 6-, 8- to 11-, 14- to 18-, 20- to 26-year-olds ), we firstly determined individual spindle peak frequencies ( between 9–16 Hz ) of background-corrected power spectra during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM, N2 and N3 ) at averaged frontal ( F3, F4 ) and centro-parietal ( C3, C4, Cz, Pz ) electrodes, where slow and fast sleep spindles typically dominate, respectively ( Cox

., 2021 ), both analyses on SO-spindle co-occurrence suggested that sleep spindles in the adult-like fast frequency range rather than the more dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles are coupled to SOs within all age groups. Hence, we reasoned, that the maturation of dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles towards adult-like fast spindles may explain age-related differences in the strength and temporal precision of SO-spindle coupling patterns

. Despite a higher frequency of the adult-like fast sleep spindles in the child and adolescent age groups, with older age, the differences in amplitude and density between development-specific and adult-like fast centro-parietal sleep spindles decreased and were no more evident in the adolescent and adult age groups. Hence, fast centro-parietal spindles become more numerous and adult-like in their frequency and amplitude characteristics in the course of maturation

., 2020; Joechner et al., 2021 ). Likewise, the individual neural rhythms that define the coupling undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development. Across maturation, sleep spindles increase in occurrence and their average frequency ( Purcell et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Consistent with this, canonical slow sleep spindles were reported to mature and dominate during early childhood

. To capture the ‘maturational stage’ of fast spindles for every participant, we resorted to our observed age-related differences in sleep spindles ( Figure 1 ) and computed the distance between development-specific and adult-like fast sleep spindles within each individual at a given age. Specifically, we calculated difference measures in sleep spindle characteristics ( i. e., frequency, density, amplitude ) between adult-like and development-specific fast sleep spindles

. Specifically, based on previous analyses ( Joechner et al., 2021 ), we reasoned that the development of fast sleep spindles might be associated with the maturation of SO-spindle coupling. For this, we re-analyzed previously published nocturnal EEG data from a cross-sectional sample of 24 5- to 6-year-old children ( 13 female, Mage = 5 years, 10. 71 months, SDage = 7. 28 months; Joechner et al

. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how developments in sleep spindles and SOs interact to promote precise, adult-like temporal synchronization of sleep spindles during SOs across childhood and adolescence. Therefore, we aimed to ( i ) characterize the modulation of sleep spindles during SOs across different ages and ( ii ) investigate how sleep spindle and SO maturity relate to the manifestation of SO-spindle coupling across different ages

. 001 ) and from 900 to 1200 ms ( p = 0. 004; SO up peak at ≈ 559 ms ). Critically, and somewhat unexpectedly for the two younger age groups, the previous analysis of spectral power differences in the sleep spindle frequency range along the SO cycle suggested temporal SO-spindle alignment specifically for events in the adult-like fast spindle range ( Joechner et al., 2021; Piantoni et al., 2013a ). Hence, we repeated the PETH analyses for adult-like fast sleep spindles

. In sum, our results suggest that developmental age differences in the manifestation of SO-spindle coupling are uniquely related to the degree to which the dominant, development-specific fast spindle type within an individual, that is, the sleep spindles that can be identified as peaks in the power spectrum ( Aru et al., 2015; see Figure 1A ), shares characteristics with adult-like fast sleep spindles.

. However, independent of the sleep spindle type, increased sleep spindle occurrence was more precisely timed with the SO up peak at older ages. Hence, despite clearly identifiable development-specific fast spindles, pronounced and temporally precise SO-spindle coupling seems to depend on the presence of adult-like fast sleep spindles. So far, in line with previous observations ( Joechner et al

Overall, our findings describe a unique relation between fast sleep spindle maturity and the pattern of SO-spindle coupling across childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. While SOs provide optimal time windows for sleep spindles to arise, it is the ability to generate adult-like, canonical fast spindles that determines coupling strength and precision across child and adolescent development

., 2018; Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005 ). Yet, little is known about how this precise coalescence develops across childhood and adolescence. Far from being an epiphenomenon, accumulating evidence suggests that the synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindles ( i. e., spindles defined in young adults with a frequency of ≈ 12. 5–16 Hz and a centro-parietal predominance; Cox et al

In the first step, we aimed at identifying age-specific patterns of sleep spindles

. 5–16 Hz; Cox et al., 2017; see Figure 1A–B ). For the vast majority of 14- to 18- and 20- to 26-year-olds, individually identified, dominant centro-parietal sleep spindles indeed matched the canonical fast sleep spindle frequency range ( ≈ 12. 5–16 Hz, see Figure 1A–B ). For the majority of children though, dominant fast centro-parietal spindles were nested in the canonical slow spindle range ( i. e., as on average observed in adults with a frequency of ≈ 9–12. 5 Hz; Cox et al

. 001; Supplementary file 1c, e, and g ). For sleep spindle frequency, follow-up pairwise comparisons revealed that sleep spindles showed a higher frequency at centro-parietal derivations as compared to frontal electrodes within every age group ( all t ≤ –5. 38, all padj < 0. 001 ). Further, frontal spindle frequency was lowest for the 5- to 6- year-olds as compared to all older age groups ( all t ≤ –3. 69, all padj ≤ 0

. Based on the individual frontal and centro-parietal spindle peak frequencies, we then detected sleep spindle events in frontal and centro-parietal sites which represent the person- and age-specific dominant spindle rhythms per individual ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for examples of averaged EEG signals time-locked to the occurrence of these dominant sleep spindles ). We then compared features of these individually identified sleep spindles ( i. e

. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that the frequency of adult-like fast sleep spindles was consistently higher as compared to the development-specific fast centro-parietal spindles within all age groups, except the 20- to 26-year-olds ( t5-6 ( 135. 85 ) = 18. 70, padj 5-6 < 0. 001; t- 8 (135 .85 ) 2. 5 , pad 8 < 0.001; t- 14 (135.85 ) 2. 5, pad 14 < 0.001; t- 20 (135.85 ) 2 .5, pad 20 < 0.001; t-26 (135.85 ) 2. 5, pad 26 <0.001 ). In contrast, the amplitude of adult fast spind was higher compared to development spind in the 5- to 6 and 8- to 11-year-old groups ( t-6 (135.85 ) 2 .5, pad 6 <0.001; t-8 (135.85 ) 2.5, pad 8 <0.001 ) but not in the 14 to 18- and 20 to 26-year-old groups ( t-14 (135.85 ) 2.5 pad 14 >0.05; t-20 (135.85 ) 2. pad 20 >0.05 ). The density of adult fast spind was higher than development spind in the 5 to 6 and 8 to 11-year-old groups ( t-6 (135.85 ) 2. pad 6 <0.001; t-8 (135. )2. pad 8 <0.001 ) but not in the 14 to 18 and 20 to 26-year groups ( t14 (135.85 ) 2 pad 14 >.05; t20 (135. )2 pad 20 >.05. The amplitude and density of development spind was higher than adult sp in the 14 to 18 and 20 to 26-year groups ( t14 (135.85 ) 2 pad 14 <0.001; t20 (135. )2 pad 20 <0.001 ) but not in the 5 to 6 and 8 year-old groups t (5 (135.85 ) 2 pad 5 >.05;8 (135. ) pad 8 >.05

To investigate the relationship between sleepind and slow oscillations, we analyzed the co-occurrence of spind in the adult fast range (12.5–16 Hz ) and slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz ) across the four age groups (5- 6, 8- 11, 14 18, 20 26 ). We found that spind in the adult fast range were coupled with slow oscillations in all age groups. However, the coupling was less precise in the 5 to 6 and 8-year-old groups compared to the 14 to 18 and 20 26-year-old groups ( t-6 (135.85 ) 2. pad 6 <0.001; t8 (135. )2 pad 8 <0.001; t14 (135. )2 pad 14 >0.05; t20 (135 ) pad 20 >.05. The coupling strength of spind with slow oscillations was higher in the 14 to 18 and 20-year groups compared to the 5 to 6 and 8-year groups ( t14 (135. )2 pad 14 <.001 t20 (135 ) pad 20 <.001 ) but not between the 14 and 20-year groups t (14 (135 ) pad 14 >.05;20 (135 ) pad 20. The precision of sp with slow oscill was higher in the 14 18 and 20-year groups compared the 5 6 and 8-year ( t14 (135 ) pad 14 <.001 t8 (135 pad 8.001 ) but not between

    Title: 
    Abstract: Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes ( FMUG ), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug. amaral. northwestern. edu as a MacOS/Windows app.

   . Jointly, the above findings reinforce that understudied genes become abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. The abandonment of understudied genes could be driven by the valid concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact ( Kustatscher et al., 2022 ), as observed around the turn of the millenium ( Pfeiffer and Hoffmann, 2007 )

We sought to identify at which point in the scientific process understudied genes are ignored as research targets in investigations using -omics experiments ( Figure 1A ). To receive scholarly attention, a gene must travel through a pipeline from biological reality to experimental results to write-up of those results. These results must be extended by subsequent research by other scholars

., 2016; Haynes et al., 2018; Border et al., 2019; Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Byrne et al., 2022 ), that the lack of publications on some genes is not explained by a lack of underlying biological experimental evidence. We next evaluated the second possibility that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors

., 2021 ). To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we combined all the above insights to create a tool we denoted find my understudied genes ( FMUG ). Our literature review revealed several tools and resources aiming to promote research of understudied genes by publicizing understudied genes ( Duek et al., 2018; Crow et al., 2019; Perdigão and Rosa, 2019; Essegian et al., 2020; Sheils et al., 2021; Higgins et al., 2022; Wainberg et al., 2021; Rocha et al

. Thus, there may not be any incentive for authors of high-throughput studies to highlight understudied genes. To illuminate why understudied genes are abandoned between experimental results and the write-up of results, we performed a literature review to identify factors that have been proposed to limit studies of understudied genes ( Supplementary file 3 ). These factors range from evolutionary factors ( e. g. whether a gene only has homologs in primates ), to chemical factors ( e. g

. Notably, we found that the concern of publications on understudied genes receiving fewer citations does not hold for present-day research on human genes; in biomedical literature at-large, articles focusing on less-investigated genes typically accumulate more citations, an effect that has held consistently since 2001 ( Figure 2 )

. Authors of high-throughput studies do not highlight understudied genes in the title or abstract of their publications, the sections of the publication most accessible to other scientists. While, overall, understudied genes ( and high-throughput assays themselves [Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2022] ) correlate with increased citation impact, for high-throughput studies any potential gain in citations is either absent or too small to be significant

. This result again opposes the hypothesis that less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. Returning to our observation that understudied hits from high-throughput assays are not promoted to the title and abstract of the resulting publication, we next tested if different experimental approaches demonstrated distinct associations between gene popularity and citations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 )

. To evaluate these three possibilities, we gathered high-throughput experimental results and the titles and abstracts of articles reporting on these results, as well as the titles and abstracts of articles citing these reporting articles ( focus studies ). We then quantified the attention that ‘hit’ genes from these experiments had received by counting their occurrences in titles of abstracts within the entire biomedical literature excluding these high-throughput experiments

. The second possibility is that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. The final possibility is that subsequent studies do not continue work on understudied genes revealed by the initial study

. This finding suggests that authors of high-throughput studies have little to gain or lose citation-wise by highlighting understudied genes. To summarize, our investigations are reminiscent of the previously described separation between ‘large-scale’ and ‘small-scale’ biological research ( Knorr Cetina, 1999; Alberts, 1985; Richardson and Stevens, 2015 )

., 2023 ). The insight that understudied genes are lost to titles and abstracts of research articles in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results, and FMUG, have already been useful in guiding our own unknomics research ( Figure 4B )

. Further, the observed discrepancy between the popularity of hits highlighted by GWAS versus other technologies suggests that some -omics technologies may be more powerful than others for characterizing understudied genes. This possibility merits further research and researchers participating in unknomics should consider the relative strengths of each technology toward providing tractable results for follow-up

. As any of these factors could plausibly affect gene selection within individual domains of biomedical research, we returned to the -omics data described above ( Figure 1B ) and measured how much these factors align with the selective highlighting of hit genes in the title or abstract of GWAS, AP-MS, transcriptomics, and CRISPR studies

. As our present analysis is correlative, it also is tempting to propose controlled trials where published manuscripts on high-throughput studies randomly report hit genes in the abstract even if not investigated further by the authors. This intervention would need to be carefully designed since abstracts are limited in their size

. Third, we take a gene being mentioned in the title or abstract of an article as a proxy for a gene receiving attention by the article’s authors. The title and abstract are space-limited and thus cannot accommodate discussion of large numbers of genes. Fourth, our literature review also identified further factors that we could not test more directly because of absent access to fitting data. These are: experts’ tendency to deepen their expertise ( Edwards et al

. This may explain the prior observation that the total number of articles on individual genes partially correlates with the total number of occurrences as a hit in GWAS studies ( Stoeger et al., 2018 ). Evaluating the final possibility, we found that the reception of -omics studies in later scientific literature either reproduced authors’ initial selection of highly studied genes or slightly mitigated it

. We indeed found that hit genes that are highlighted in the title or abstract are over-represented among the 20% highest-studied genes in all biomedical literature ( Figure 1B ). These trends are independent of significance threshold ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) and ( except for CRISPR screens ) whether we considered the current scientific literature or literature published before 2003, before any of these articles had been published ( Figure 1—figure supplement 6 )

., 2022; Wainberg et al., 2021; Rocha et al., 2023 or by providing information about hit genes Stoeger et al., 2018; Rebhan et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2017; Kustatscher et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022 ). However, we noted the absence of tools enabling scientists to actively engage with factors that align with gene selection

Efforts to address the gaps in detailed knowledge about most genes have crystallized as initiatives promoting the investigation of understudied sets of genes, an approach to gene scholarship recently termed ‘unknomics’ ( Rocha et al., 2023 )

    Provide a **formal summary** of the article in 200-600 words. **Do not include explanations, self-reflections, preamble, extra formatting, or additional notes.** 
    Keep the response strictly to the summary. The study investigated the selection of genes as research targets in high-throughput -omics experiments. Genes that were already studied before the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 were prioritized over understudied genes. Despite the adoption of high-throughput technologies, which identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease, understud genes were abandoned between the completion of experiments and the reporting of results. The study found that understud genes were frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but not investigated by authors. A tool, find understud genes (FM), was developed to promote the investigation of understud genes. The tool allows scientists to engage with bias during the selection of hits. FM was demonstrated through the identification of understud genes in vertebrate aging. The study suggests that authors of high-through studies have little to gain or lose by highlighting understud genes. The findings are reminiscent of the separation between ‘large’ and ‘small’ biological research. The discrepancy between the popularity of hits by GWAS and other technologies suggests that some -omics may be more powerful for characterizing understud genes. The relative strengths of each technology should be considered for tractable results follow-up. The study identified factors that affect the selection of genes, including evolutionary, chemical, and biological factors. The concern that understud genes receive fewer citations does not hold for present research on human genes. Articles on less-invest genes accumulate citations, an effect that has held since 200. The authors of high-through studies do not highlight understud genes in titles and abstracts, sections accessible to other scientists. Understud genes and high-through assays correlate with increased impact, but high-through studies gain is absent or too small to be significant.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.

   . Here, we have successfully established a short-term zebrafish model that exhibits significantly excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) induced by glucose treatment. Using this model, we examined the effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and investigated the molecular mechanisms

. Based on this model, we observed significant excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides, initiated by activating the quiescent ECs into proliferating tip cells. The effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were then proved to be mediated by the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. The results have provided novel insights into the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health and the underlying mechanisms.

., 2010; Jörgens et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2016 ). Several recent studies have investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular function in the zebrafish model ( Jung et al., 2016; Heckler and Kroll, 2017; Jörgens et al., 2015 ). However, the association between noncaloric monosaccharides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive angiogenesis, has not been elucidated

. The findings revealed that the knockdown of Marcksl1a could effectively mitigate the excessive angiogenesis caused by high D-glucose or high L-glucose treatment, resembling the rescue effect observed with VEGFR inhibitor Lenvatinib ( Figure 8h–n, Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ). These results suggested that monosaccharides induced excessive angiogenesis through the Foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway in zebrafish embryos.

. Additionally, our result further revealed that Foxo1a exerts its regulatory function during this process by downregulating its target gene marcksl1a, regardless of whether the embryos were treated with D-glucose or L-glucose. Taken together, our results suggested that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides treatment could lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway

In this study, we successfully established a new zebrafish model with significant excessive angiogenesis, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in PDR more closely than previously established models ( Jung et al., 2016; Jörgens et al., 2015 ). Jung et al. have described a short-term zebrafish model for diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) induced by high glucose, which exhibited blood vessel defects ( Jung et al., 2016 )

. Therefore, our study investigated the potential effects of fructose on vascular dysfunction in comparison to glucose. The result demonstrated fructose-induced excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

. Furthermore, despite the potential conversion of these disaccharides into monosaccharides, the restricted reaction rate may maintain them within a safe concentration range that is not harmful to the vessels in a short period. In conclusion, to investigate the effects of monosaccharides on vascular development, we established a zebrafish model by treating the embryos with high concentrations of monosaccharides

. For a long time, there has been considerable debate and conflicting opinions regarding how specific sugars affect the development of type 2 diabetes rather than excess calories per se ( Qi and Tester, 2020; Laville and Nazare, 2009 ). In this study, we have provided new evidence indicating that the administration of noncaloric monosaccharides leads to significant excessive angiogenesis, suggesting that the excessive angiogenesis may not be only attributed to the caloric properties

. It has been reported that the loss of function of foxo1a led to excessive angiogenesis ( Wilhelm et al., 2016; Rudnicki et al., 2018 ). Our study also revealed that foxo1a was significantly downregulated in arterial and capillary ECs after high glucose treatment compared to the ECs marker gene pecam1 ( Figure 5c–e ). The in situ hybridization ( ISH ) experiments further confirmed the decrease in foxo1a expression following treatment with high D-glucose and L-glucose ( Figure 5f )

To establish the short-term zebrafish hyperangiogenenic model induced by high glucose treatment, we immersed the Tg ( fli1aEP:EGFP-CAAX ) ntu666 embryos, a transgenic line wherein the endothelial cells were labeled with membrane-bound GFP ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), in glucose solution within a wide range of concentrations and time windows ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). We subsequently measured the glucose concentration in the embryos

. Interestingly, we observed that all these noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive angiogenesis, among which the L-glucose purchased from two companies resulted in a similar phenotype as efficiently as D-glucose did ( Figure 2a–h )

. However, the exact mechanism through which hyperglycemia impairs the blood vessels is not well determined. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data of the ECs isolated from D-glucose-treated embryos to gain more insights into it. The findings revealed an increased ratio of tip cells and proliferating ECs, accompanied by the altered expression of various angiogenic genes in the ECs of D-glucose-treated embryos

. Our results provided new evidence for the negative roles of caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides on vascular development.

. The real-time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) and ISH experiments further confirmed the elevated expression levels of marcksl1a following high D-glucose and L-glucose treatment ( Figure 7c and d ). Then, by constructing the transgenic zebrafish line hsp70l:marcksl1a-p2A-mCherry::Tg ( fli1a:EGFP-CAAX ) ntu666, we conducted the experiments to overexpress marcksl1a in zebrafish and subsequently observed the vascular developmental phenotype

. It was revealed that the ratio of arterial and capillary ECs and proliferating ECs was increased in the high glucose-treated embryos ( Figure 4i and j ), consistent with the observation that glucose treatment resulted in excessive sprouting angiogenesis of ISVs. In addition, we examined tip cell marker genes in arterial and capillary ECs

., 2018; Barros et al., 2008; Elo et al., 2007 ). The combination of embryonic transparency and transgenic lines, wherein endothelial cells are labeled specifically with fluorescent proteins, facilitates the high-resolution imaging analysis of vascular formation in vivo. Immersion of zebrafish in glucose solution has been found to induce diabetic complications, including vascular dysfunction ( Gleeson et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2010; Jörgens et al., 2012; Jung et al

. Despite the abnormal vessel formation, no significant developmental defects were observed in these treated embryos when examined under a bright-field microscope ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c ). Moreover, no excessive angiogenic phenotype was observed in the embryos treated with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% D-glucose within the corresponding time frame ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ). Fructose is a ketonic monosaccharide that is an energy source for living organisms

. Furthermore, we observed that these outgrowths of the ectopic angiogenic sprouts could establish a connection to the neighboring sprouts and vessels and thereby form complicated vascular structures ( Figure 1c, f, i, l, and p ). We did a single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis to gain more insight into the potential mechanism through which glucose activates the ECs. Due to the limited presence of ECs within the zebrafish embryos, the analysis of these cells poses a challenge

. To rule out the effect of osmotic pressure caused by high glucose on ECs, we treated the embryos with 1%, 2, 3, and 4 D-glucose ( Figure 1— supplement 5 ) and observed no significant angiogenic phenotype ( Figure 1— supplement 6 ). The results suggested that the effect of glucose on ECs is not due to osmotic pressure but rather a direct action on the cells

In this study, we established a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and nonoric monoscharides, resembling the hyperogenic characteristics observed in proliferative retinopathy ( PDR ). Using this model, we investigated the effects of nonoric and caloric monoschar on vascular development and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that glucose and nonoric monoschar induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( IS ) The branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation quies endothelial ( EC ) into cells Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of EC in embryos exposed to high glucose revealed augmented ratio capillary EC proliferating EC and series upregulated proangiogenic genes Further analysis and validated that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by monoschar via upregulating expression marck1 This study provided new evidence the negative effects nonoric monoschar on vascular and the underlying mechanisms

The text is a scientific research article discussing the effects of artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monoschar on blood vessel function. The researchers used a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose, similar to the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative retinopathy (PDR). They found that glucose and nonoric monchar induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (IS). The branched vessels were formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial (EC) cells into tip. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of EC in embryos exposed to high glucose showed an increased ratio of capillary EC, proliferating EC, and upregulated angiogenic genes. Further analysis validated that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by monchar via upregulating marck1. This study provided new evidence on the negative effects of nonoric monchar on vascular and the mechanisms.

The researchers established a short-term zraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes in proliferative retinopathy (P) induced by glucose. Using this model, they examined the effects of nonoric monchar on vessel development and the molecular mechanisms. They observed excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and nonoricchar, initiated by quies EC into proliferating cells. The effects of monchar on excessive angiogenesis were proved to be mediated by fox1-marck1 pathway. The results provided novel insights into the roles of nonoricchar in health and mechanisms.

The study found that knockdown of marck1 could mitigate excessive angiogenesis caused by high-glucose or high-gl treatment, similar to the effect with VEG inhibitor. The results suggested monchar induced angiogenesis through fox1-mar1 in zraf embryos. Further, they found that fox regulates this process by downregulating its target marck, regardless of embryos treated with-gl or-gl. Together, results suggested both caloric and nonchar treatment lead to excessive angi by promoting differentiation quies EC into cells through fox1-mar1 pathway.

They established a new zraf model with excessive angiogenesis resembling hyperogenic observed P more closely than established models. They investigated the effects fructose on vascular in comparison to glucose. Results showed fructose excessive angiogenesis inraf embryos. Despite conversion dischar into monchar, the reaction maintained within safe range not harmful vessels short. To investigate effects monchar on development, they established zraf model treating embryos with high concentrations monchar.

The study provided new evidence that administration nonoric monchar leads significant angiogenesis, suggesting excessive may not attributed cal properties. Loss of fox1 led excessive angi (Wilhelm et
Researchers investigated how the brain processes multiple sequences and stores information in working memory (WM). Participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and locations and reproduced the color and location sequences one after another. The study manipulated the consistency between location and color trajectories. Sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrated improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Sequences with consistent trajectories showed neural reactivation of trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior. Findings suggest a common structure is leveraged for storage of multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating efficient organization in WM.

EEG recordings provided evidence for a compressive strategy, reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and replay of color sequences during recall. Structure reactivation related to WM and replay. Behaviorally, sequences with aligned color trajectories showed enhanced memory and correlation between color and location trajectories. Neural replay mechanisms mediate sequence combinations based on common structures. Converging behavioral and neural evidence for leveraging common structures facilitate WM.

Sequences with color-location aligned (condition) showed precision and correlation between reproduced and location trajectories. Neural has been posited to represent structure (Huang et al, 2018; Liu et al,2019), structure inference (Liu et al,202b), and generalization(Barry and Love,202). Replay occurs for color but not location during recall, supporting spontaneous nature. Color exhibited weaker decoding strength than location, consistent with results. Confirming location and representations during encoding, neural correlates of sequence during retrieval were examined. Replay appears for color aligned but not misaligned sequences, implicating consolidation of shared structure.

Thirty participants performed a visual WM task with EEG. At beginning, three disks with locations and colors were presented. Participants remembered locations, colors, and orders. Sequences showed improvement with trajectories across domains, indicating aligned may reduce uncertainty. Investigated location-color alignment in memory process. Identifying structure for efficient storage in WM is crucial. We investigated shared structures across domains for memory and neural correlates. Events are linked, not isolated, treating as information. Trajectories for location and color defined in ring system, providing abstract map for memory.

Participants divided into groups based on first-second color trajectory correlations. Higher and lower groups displayed neural of first-second right after second. Examined cognitive maps by multiple domains for efficient WM. Asked to memorize color at locations, reproduce color and sequences. Need retain two features, sequences. Interested recall period, prepare location without responses. Manipulated consistency between location and color. Color alignment associated better performance than misaligned, attributed structure constraints on items. Behavioral indicate facilitation from alignment across domains to compress. Instead of memorizing independently, maintain common trajectories.

During recall, observed reactivation color for condition. Temporally compressed replay (first:0.10-0.16, corrected p=0.048; second:0.21-0.27, corrected p=0). Extended role of map in organizing information across WM, encoding and replay facilitating multiple storage.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.

   . However, since these genetic variations were reported to cause PURA syndrome, such modest structural alterations must nevertheless result in functional impairment. The interpretation of structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of PUR domains found experimental support from the crystal structure of its K97E variant, whose mutated residue has a solvent-exposed side chain ( Figure 5B–E )

. These findings were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, indicating high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3B ). Instead of hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations, as reported for other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome ( Lombardi et al., 2015 ), pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 )

., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 ). To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome. In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity

Currently, more than 270 different pathogenic variants in the PURA gene have been identified in over 650 patients with confirmed PURA syndrome ( personal communication: PURA Foundation Australia ). The aim of this study was to understand how genetic variations causing this neurodevelopmental disorder affect the functional and structural integrity of the hsPURA protein

. In summary, this study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of hsPURA were previously predicted to have folding defects ( Reijnders et al., 2018 )

., 2016 ). In a previous study, homology models based on the dmPURA crystal structures ( Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ) were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative ( Reijnders et al., 2018 )

. Importantly, overexpression of PURA reduced the toxicity of mutant FUS by preventing its mis-localization ( Daigle et al., 2016 ). In 2014, two studies reported that a monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by sporadic mutations in the PURA gene ( Hunt et al., 2014; Lalani et al., 2014 )

. When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA’s subcellular localization, we observed impaired processing body ( P-body ) association but close-to normal localization to stress granules, indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA syndrome pathology. Two particularly interesting disease-causing variants, K97E and R140P, were further analyzed by structural means

., 2023; López-Rivera et al., 2022, Colombo et al., 2023 ). Such half PURA structures are very unlikely to exist in solution and hence predictions based on them are of very limited value or worse, prone to yield wrong interpretations. We expect that our experimentally determined structures of the human N- and C-terminal PUR domains offer more physiological structural reference points for future assessments of novel hsPURA mutations and their potential pathogenicity in patients

., 2001; Weber et al., 2016; reviewed in Janowski and Niessing, 2020 ). In this study, we show that both, the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA can separate double-stranded nucleic acids ( Figures 3D and 4E, F ) and to bind single-stranded nucleic acids ( Figures 3B, C, 4C, D ). We also tested patient-derived variants of hsPURA to find out whether they exhibit impaired interaction with nucleic acids

. For the R140P variant with unclear pathological significance, no conclusive prediction on its impact on protein folding could be made in the past. Several PURA syndrome-causing genetic variations have been reported to be located in the C-terminal, dimerization-mediating PUR domain ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 )

., 2023 ). In light of this report, our finding that patient-derived variants show impaired P-body association of hsPURA ( Figure 2 ) provide further evidence for a potential role of P-body localization of hsPURA for the etiology of PURA syndrome. It has been reported that protein domains with PC4-like fold interact with RNA and DNA and are responsible for the separation of the double-stranded nucleic acids ( Darbinian et al., 2001; Weber et al

. While failure to obtain soluble recombinant PURA with F233del prevented a direct biophysical assessment of its dimerization state in vitro ( Supplementary file 1a ), this observation already indicated a misfolding of the C-terminal PUR domain upon mutation. Consistent with this observation is also the interpretation from homology modeling based on the previously published dmPURA III structure ( Reijnders et al., 2018 )

. Recently, two publications and one manuscript uploaded to a preprint server resorted to in silico predicted, AI-based structures to model the potential impact of PURA syndrome mutations on the structural integrity of hsPURA. Instead of assessing the physiologically correct dimer consisting of two PUR repeats, all three studies analyzed in silico-predicted hsPURA half-structure consisting of a single PUR repeat III with incomplete dimerization domain ( Dai et al

. These observations provide clear evidence that in particular strands β4 and β8 of the N-terminal PUR domain are dynamic and can adopt considerable local differences within the β-sheet. This flexibility already suggests structural promiscuity of PUR domains. It also indicates that they can at least partially compensate for structural perturbance by mutations, resulting in folded domains of genetically altered proteins

., 2014; Lalani et al., 2014 ). Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, among others ( Reijnders et al., 2018; Johannesen et al., 2021 ). Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence

. These human structures were overall very similar to previously published crystal structures from dmPURA ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ). Based on the crystal structures of hsPURA III ( Figure 3A ), we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain ( hsPUR III ) that are caused by the patient-derived genetic variations F233del and R245P ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 )

. Based on the crystal structures of PURA from Drosophila melanogaster ( dmPURA ), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains ( Graebsch et al., 2010; Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ). Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA

. The results indicated that the N-terminal PUR domain is unusually flexible in its fold and prone to misfolding upon mutation. In summary, we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of genetic variations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing genetic variations of uncertain significance.

., 2018 ). Surprisingly, in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome ( Lombardi et al., 2015 ), no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome ( Johannes et al. 202; Reijers et al. 2018 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration. 

    Supporting Text:
   . These close topological relationships clearly suggest that TRPV4, ANO1, and AQP5 would be able to form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. These results also suggest that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components as well as the secretion of water and ions

., 2019 ). The involvement of TRPV4 in exocrine gland function prompted us to examine the functional interaction in perspiration because TRPV4 is expressed in human eccrine sweat glands ( Delany et al., 2001 ). Although sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine ( Ach ) is released from the nerve endings ( Hu et al., 2018 ). We show that the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction force.

. We previously showed the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 in the heterologous expression with HEK293T cells and mouse native exocrine gland acinar cells ( Takayama et al., 2014; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). Then, we examined functional TRPV4 expression in sweat glands in mouse foot pads. WT mouse sweat glands responded to the TRPV4 agonist, GSK ( 500 nM ), and to Ach ( 10 μM ) ( Figure 2A )

. Temperature-dependent basal sweating without Ach stimulation for 15 min was also observed in WT mice, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3B ). Menthol, a well-known TRPM8 activator, inhibits ANO1 function ( Takayama et al., 2017 ). The ability of menthol to inhibit both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that menthol would inhibit sweating. Accordingly, we compared stimulated sweating with either an ethanol vehicle ( used for menthol dilution ) or menthol treatment for 2 min

We detected expression of TRPV4, ANO1, and the water channel aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) in the eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. The secretory coil is located in the deep dermis and a relatively straight duct opens to the skin surface. We first validated an anti-TRPV4 antibody that we generated

. To examine the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands in vivo, stimulated sweating induced by Ach ( 100 μM, 2 min ) in mouse hind paws at 25 and 35°C was investigated using an iodine and starch reaction to measure secreted amylase ( Nejsum et al., 2002 ). At 25°C, no difference in stimulated sweating was seen both in WT and TRPV4KO mice while sweating was increased at 35°C in WT, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3A )

. However, the finding that menthol inhibits both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that transient reduction in sweating by inhibiting TRPV4 and ANO1 also contributes to the cool sensation. On the other hand, patients with hyperhidrosis can sweat enough to soak their clothing or have sweat drip off their hands ( Cohen and Solish, 2003; Schlereth et al., 2009 ). Hyperhidrosis can occur as a primary or secondary effect after infections or with some endocrine diseases

. Menthol treatment caused a significantly lower degree of sweating than ethanol treatment both in WT and TRPM8KO mice ( Figure 3C and D ). This result could indicate that menthol inhibits sweating by inhibiting the function of ANO1, independently of TRPM8. Next, in order to prove the involvement of ANO1 in basal sweating, we examined the effects of a strong and specific ANO1 antagonist, Ani9

., 2015; Derouiche et al., 2018 ) Interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 causes Cl- efflux, followed by water efflux, suggesting that the complex could be involved in exocrine gland functions including secretion of cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and tears ( Takayama et al., 2014; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). We demonstrated that the TRPV4-ANO1 interaction is also involved in water efflux associated with the exocrine function during sweating in this study

. Notably, the TRPV4, ANO1, and AQP5 complex is confined to acinar cells in secretory sweat glands, whereas TRPV4 is also expressed at other sites in skin tissues ( Figure 1 ). This result could indicate a specific function for the complex in water efflux occurring in exocrine glands. It is generally believed that signals in the brain activate sympathetic nerves that cause perspiration by releasing Ach at the sympathetic postganglionic fibers

. There are two recent reports showing that TRPV4 was not critical in regulating sweating in human subjects ( Fujii et al., 2019; Fujii et al., 2021 ), which is in contradiction to our mouse and human data. The authors focused on the vasodilating effects of TRPV4. We currently have no idea how to explain the apparently different conclusion regarding the involvement of TRPV4. Multiple factors could explain the apparent difference between the two studies

. An Ani9 treatment almost completely abolished basal sweating both at 25 and 35°C ( Figure 3E and F ), indicating a pivotal role of ANO1 in sweating. Mice do not sweat to control body temperature, so the physiological significance of hind paw sweating is unclear. In humans, fingertip moisture is known to be optimally modulated during object manipulation through regulation of friction force ( André et al., 2010 )

. We next examined whether TRPV4 also plays a role in human perspiration. Patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) have acquired impairment in total body sweating even when exposed to heat or engaging in exercise ( Nakazato et al., 2004; Munetsugu et al., 2017; Sano et al., 2017 )

. No cytosolic Ca2+ increase induced by GSK was observed in sweat glands from TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the GSK-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was significantly inhibited by menthol ( 5 μM ) in WT mouse sweat glands, suggesting that menthol inhibited TRPV4 function. Meanwhile, menthol alone caused no change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ( Figure 2C ). These data indicate functional expression of TRPV4 in mouse secretory cells

. This is a simple mechanism for body temperature regulation with perspiration. However, sweat glands themselves could sense local heating and cause sweating through warmth-sensitive TRPV4 channel activation that we clarified in this study. This local temperature sensation by TRPV4 could also be true for saliva and tear secretion that involves TRPV4/ANO1 interaction ( Derouiche et al., 2018 )

., 2009 ). However, the molecular mechanisms of perspiration are not clearly understood. We previously reported the functional interaction between TRP channels and the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, anoctamin 1 ( ANO1, also known as TMEM16A ) ( Takayama et al., 2014; Takayama et al., 2015; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability ( Gees et al

. Others can experience hyperhidrosis on the palms of their hands when nervous. Development of chemicals targeting TRPV4, ANO1, or the complex could be a new therapeutic strategy for these conditions, for which there are currently no effective treatments. Many TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability, suggesting that Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels in turn activates ANO ( Takama et al. 2014; Takama et al.2015; Deriche et al.2018 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale is more detailed than a list of summary morphometric measures, and more informative than the mere listing of every sulcus and gyrus. We propose this new syntax as the basis for a more rigorous characterisation of brain morphology and morphological changes. A clear advantage is that some biological processes may only act on a specific spatial scales, leaving other scales untouched ( ageing in our example )

. This suggests a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding. As a practical additional outcome of our study, we could show that our novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better ( four times the effect size ) than the metrics we have been using so far at a single native scale

., 2016 ), but all on one ( native ) scale with comparable effect sizes for classification applications ( Wang et al., 2016 ). In simple terms: we know that objects can have the same fractal dimension, but differ greatly in a range of other shape properties. However, we demonstrate here, that representative primate brains and mammalian brains indeed share a range of other key shape properties, on top of agreeing in fractal dimension

., 2021 ). Empirically, the main result of this paper is the demonstration of a universal self-similar scaling ( Equation 3 ) for primate, and presumably mammalian cortices. There are two aspects of this universality: first that for each and every cortex the value of Kremains the same for all scales as one removes substructures smaller than a varying length scale ( or equivalently, that the fractal dimension is almost exactly 2. 5 in all cases )

. Indeed, fractal scaling for various aspects of cortical morphology has often been postulated ( Free et al., 1996; Kiselev et al., 2003 ), with a number of recent papers making use of MRI data ( Marzi et al., 2021; Jao et al., 2021; Meregalli et al., 2022; Díaz Beltrán et al., 2024 ). Most recently published estimates of fractal dimension for the whole cortex are indeed close to 2. 5 ( King et al., 2010; Madan and Kensinger, 2016; Madan and Kensinger, 2017; Marzi et al

. This method is a new systematic way of obtaining shape properties from the cortex in terms of a sequence of morphometric measurements as spatial scale varies. By examining how areas scale across coarse-grained versions of actual primate cortices, we will be able to directly verify cortical self-similarity.

. For scales over ∼5 mm, and under ∼0. 5 mm the differences become relatively small, suggesting the ageing process has less effect on the largest and smallest cortical morphological features. Finally, we reproduced these results in an independent dataset in Appendix 7. 2

Compared to previous literature, we can summarise our main contribution and advance as follows: ( i ) We are showing for the first time that representative primate species follow the exact same fractal scaling – as opposed to previous work showing that they have a similar fractal dimension ( Hofman, 1985; Hofman, 1991 ), i. e., slope, but not necessarily the same offset, as previous methods had no consistent way of comparing offsets

. ( ii ) Previous work could also not show direct agreement in morphometrics between the coarse-grained brains of primate species and other non-primate mammalian species. ( iii ) Demonstrating in proof-of-principle that multiscale morphometrics, in practice, can have much larger effect sizes for classification applications. This moves beyond our previous work where we only showed the scaling law across ( Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2014 ) and within species ( Wang et al

. Ultimately, we hope this new framework for expressing and analysing cortical morphology, besides revealing a hitherto hidden regularity of nature, can become a powerful tool to characterise and compare cortices of different species and individuals, across development and ageing, and across health and disease.

. For most classification applications in biology and medicine, the increased effect size and hence separability of groups in the scale-dependent morphometrics represent a huge advance over the native scale. Our work here was limited to summary descriptors of entire cortical hemispheres, but future work will explore extensions of these methods to lobes and cortical areas, similarly to Wang et al., 2019; Leiberg et al., 2021

. In this framework, our main result can thus be expressed simply: for all the cortices we analysed, and for none of the non-cortices, coarse-graining will leave K largely unaffected, while morphological complexity S will decrease. In the final part of our work, we show how our algorithm and the associated new understanding of brain morphology may become useful in applications. As an example, we will focus on how the ageing process affects human cortical morphology across scales

. Intuitively, with increasing box size, the smaller details below the resolution of a single box would disappear first, and increasingly larger details will follow – precisely what we require from a coarse-graining method. We, therefore, propose to expand the traditional box-counting method beyond its use to measure the fractal dimension, but to analyse the reconstructed cortices as different realisations of the original cortex at the specified spatial scale

. 2. In this particular example, the scale-dependency of morphological measures can be visually and intuitively understood by looking at the reconstructed surfaces at each scale: Figure 4B shows some coronal slices of the cortical surface. On a scale of 0. 27 mm, the gyri in the younger subjects are densely packed, but the older subjects show the expected widening between gyral walls and decrease in gyral surface area at the crown ( see e. g. Jin et al

. Primate brains, therefore, have all three characteristics of self-similarity, fractality ( with df=2. 5 ), and universality ( invariant K for all scales and species ) at the same time. Thus, coarse-grained primate cortices are morphometrically similar to, and in terms of the universal law, ‘as valid as’ actual existing mammalian cortices

. The similarities we highlighted here are on the level of summary metrics, and our goal was to highlight the universality in such metrics points towards highly conserved quantities and mechanisms. The observation that with increasing voxel sizes, the coarse-grained cortices tend to be smoother and thicker is particularly interesting: the scaling law in Equation 3 can be understood as thicker cortices ( T ) form larger folds ( or are smoother i. e

. The scaling law can, therefore, be understood as a physically and biologically plausible statements and our algorithm yields results in line with the scaling law. More broadly, the interaction between brain development and evolution may also benefit from a scale-specific understanding. This may be important in elucidating what in cortical morphology is selected for by evolution, what is determined by physics; what is specified by genes, and what is emergent

., 2021 ) a set of independent measures, K, I, and S, that summarise the morphometry of the cortex in a natural and statistically robust way. In this framework, isometrically scaled copies of the same morphometry all map onto a line along the I=log⁡At+log⁡Ae+log⁡T2 direction, which is perpendicular to a K×S plane that fully summarises their shape

Many structures in nature, and in particular biology ( Elston and Zietsch, 2005; Codling et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2009; Losa, 2011; Klonowski, 2016; et al. 2017 ) have been shown to be fractal in nature. The fractal dimension of the cortex has been estimated to be close to 2.5 in several studies ( King et al,2010; Madan and Kensinger,2016; Mad and Kensinger,2017 Marzi et. 202; Marzi et 202; Dí Belán et 2024 ), but our work is the first to show that all primate and mammalian cortices follow the same fractal scaling law.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.

   . Finally, we used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Using live imaging with knockdown of selected targets, our results uncover novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.

. Taken together, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells and additionally identified that the known actin modulators ARHGAP31/NUAK2 are both RELA targets ( Figure 3 ) and regulators of nuclear RELA with TNFα ( Figure 4 ), providing a potential mechanism mediating the relationship between actin and RELA.

. In contrast, NFKB1 and NFKB2 showed increased interaction with RELA with TNFα. RELA therefore appears to form NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1 and NFKB2 in PDAC cells. To test for potential feedback loops regulating RELA in PDAC, we evaluated the effect of siRNA knockdown of TNFα-regulated genes on TNFα-stimulated RELA dynamics

. These results suggest that IκBβ plays a significant role in suppressing TNFα induction of nuclear RELA in PDAC cells. Interestingly, nuclear RELA AUC in control conditions was affected by all of the tested NF-κB pathway components in PANC1 cells, indicating that RELA is highly modulated by NF-κB/IκB proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues

. Having observed sustained and non-oscillatory nuclear RELA with TNFα ( Figure 1 ), we considered in more detail how the expression of NF-κB transcription factors and IκB family proteins is affected by TNFα dose and RELA inactivation by IκB-SR in PDAC cells, given that IκB proteins are known regulators of RELA across cell types ( Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988 )

. Overall, we identified gene expression patterns linked to TNFα dose and duration, as well as variable dependence on RELA, suggesting that TNFα/RELA dynamics determine transcriptional output in PDAC cells

. While no NF-κB pathway components appear to regulate the fold-change of nuclear RELA in PANC1 cells to 1 hr TNFα, the knockdown of several NF-κB/IκB genes upregulated nuclear RELA in PANC1 cells with 12 hr treatment: NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, and RELB. Finally, the fold-change in nuclear RELA signal with 12 hr TNFα was significantly upregulated by NFKBIB depletion in PANC1 cells, suggesting that IκBβ plays a role specifically in the ‘late’ response of RELA to TNFα in this cell line

. To identify potential regulatory loops involving RELA in PDAC, we used RNA-seq analysis with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells treated with varying TNFα doses +/-IκB-SR. We identified 254 genes significantly regulated by TNFα, which may be viewed as candidates for targeting NF-κB signalling or output in PDAC. Identifying novel targets for PDAC is important as the 5-year survival rate of non-resected PDAC patients has remained unchanged from 1975 to 2011 ( Bengtsson et al., 2020 )

. To this end, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of PDAC cells at an early ( 1 hr ) and late ( 5 hr ) timepoint with varying TNFα doses ( 0. 01, 0. 1, or 10 ng/ml TNFα ), using MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells expressing endogenously tagged RELA-GFP and doxycycline ( dox ) -inducible IκB super repressor ( IκB-SR ). IκB-SR induction was used to determine which genes require RELA nuclear translocation. A total of 254 genes were differentially expressed in high TNFα ( 0

. These findings indicate that the expression of these genes relies on nuclear translocation of RELA, while the other NF-κB and IκB genes, including the canonical RELA binding partner NFKB1, do not require RELA activation for expression. We also considered how the expression of NF-κB and IκB genes is affected by the treatment duration of TNFα ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A’’ ), combining data from 0. 01, 0. 1, and 10 ng/ml TNFα

. In terms of knockdown of NF-κB protein encoding genes, depletion of the non-canonical gene RELB significantly affected the RELA response to TNFα in the MIA PaCa2 cell line, with RELB depletion downregulating nuclear RELA ( fold-change ) at 1 hr and upregulating nuclear RELA ( fold-change ) at 12 hr, suggesting that RELB regulates both the ‘early’ and ‘late’ nuclear translocation responses of RELA to TNFα in MIA PaCa2 cells

. To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC, we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA, actin, and tubulin measurements for hypothesis generation: one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, nuclear RELA was statistically predicted as dependent on actin features across Bayesian models

. Distributions of nuclear RELA in the five PDAC cell lines by immunofluorescence revealed highly heterogeneous RELA responses within and across the PDAC cell lines ( Figure 2A ). To identify features that predict RELA localisation differences, we collated and incorporated normalised single-cell measurements across all PDAC cell lines and TNFα treatments into Bayesian networks, harnessing the observed variation in RELA ( Figure 2B )

., 2018 ), while RAC1 expression is required for the development of PDAC tumours, in addition to the formation of the ADM and PanIN precursors in KRASG12D mouse models ( Heid et al., 2011 ), indicating that RAC1 may play a role in actin remodelling during PDAC initiation. Our results also demonstrate that TNFα upregulates RNA expression of the kinase-encoding gene NUAK2 ( SNARK ), while NUAK2 expression is abrogated in the presence of IκB-SR

. Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood, studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression ( Rosette and Karin, 1995; Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001; Németh et al., 2004 ). Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours ( Weichert et al., 2007; Zhao et al

. As expected, RELA siRNA demonstrated the most significant reduction in the AUC of nuclear RELA signal compared to the non-targeting siRNA in both cell lines in both basal conditions and with TNFα. In both cell lines, depletion of NFKBIB also caused significant upregulation RELA responsiveness ( fold-change ) to TNFα, while PANC1 cells also displayed RELA upregulation with NFKBIA or ARHGAP31 depletion and RELA downregulation with NFKB2 depletion

. Conversely, we identified statistically significant higher ( whole track ) mean nuclear RELA in G2 cells in the PANC1 cell line alone in response to TNα ( Figure 4 ), indicating that RELA is modulated by ARHG31 and NFKIA in the absence of TNα in PANC cells.

    Title: 
    Abstract: A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs.

   . elegans ) result in impairments in GABAergic inhibitory signaling due to decreased activity of the transcription factor DAF-16 ( the ortholog for FOXO in C. elegans ) during neurodevelopment. Interestingly, cholinergic excitatory motor neurons remain unaffected. This targeted impairment of inhibitory signals causes an imbalance between E/I neurotransmission in the animal’s neuromuscular system

. Thus, it is likely that βHB acts at early L1 stages to mitigate neurological GABAergic defects in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mutations in daf-18, the C. elegans ortholog of PTEN, lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without significantly affecting cholinergic excitatory signals

. However, our results suggest that, in the C. elegans neuromuscular system, decreased activity of DAF-18/PTEN affects GABAergic development due to a downregulation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor activity. The FOXO family of transcription factors is conserved throughout the animal kingdom ( Arden, 2008 )

. Our findings demonstrate that mutations in daf-18/PTEN and daf-16/FOXO result in developmental defects in GABAergic neurons, leading to altered morphology and function while leaving cholinergic motor neurons unaffected. Our experiments strongly suggest that these defects in the inhibitory transmission arise from the hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway, along with subsequent DAF-16/FOXO inhibition, in GABAergic neurons of daf-18/PTEN mutants

., 2019b; Opperman et al., 2017; Giles et al., 2019; Bessa et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, the substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans ( Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998; Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ) enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment. We here found that mutations in daf-18 ( the ortholog for PTEN in C

. Furthermore, we observed that the hypercontraction observed in daf-18/PTEN mutants after the activation of cholinergic neurons is significantly reduced in animals exposed to βHB ( Figure 4H–J ). These findings suggest that this ketone body can rebalance excitatory and inhibitory signals in the neuromuscular system of daf-18/PTEN C. elegans mutants. We also evaluated the morphology of GABAergic motor neurons in daf-18/PTEN animals exposed to βHB

. This observation opens the possibility that one of the mechanisms by which daf-18/PTEN mutants have defects in GABAergic neurodevelopment involves integrin expression and/or function. Interestingly, mutations in eel-1, the C. elegans ortholog of HUWE1, or in subunits of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex, lead to developmental and functional alterations in GABAergic neurons but not in cholinergic neurons ( Opperman et al., 2017; Kowalski et al

. Our pharmacological experiments showed that mutants associated with an exacerbation of the PI3K pathway, which typically inhibits the nuclear translocation and activity of the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, lead to E/I imbalances that manifest as hypersensitivity to cholinergic drugs. We demonstrated that these imbalances arise from defects that occur specifically in the neurodevelopment of GABAergic motor neurons

. Importantly, our study’s pivotal finding is that a βHB-enriched diet during early development, robustly mitigates the deleterious effects of daf-18/PTEN mutations in GABAergic neurons. This protective effect is critically dependent on the induction of DAF-16/FOXO by this ketone body.

. elegans generates guidance defects, abnormal branching, incomplete commissural outgrowth, and deficient function of inhibitory GABAergic neurons, without affecting the excitatory cholinergic neurons. daf-18/PTEN-deficient mutants have a shorter lifespan ( Mihaylova et al., 1999 ). One possibility is that the defects in GABAergic processes are due to neurodegeneration associated with premature aging rather than developmental flaws

. This suggests that the CeTOR pathway is not involved in daf-18/PTEN pharmacological phenotypes. In C. elegans, the body wall muscles receive cholinergic innervation, which induces contraction, and GABAergic innervation, which leads to relaxation. The contralateral activity of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons facilitates the characteristic undulatory movement of the animal ( Figure 2A )

. In summary, these results strongly suggest that in daf-18/PTEN and daf-16/FOXO mutants, there is a specific functional defect in GABAergic neurons, while excitatory neurons do not appear to be affected. Since our previous results imply perturbations of neuromuscular transmission, we explored the morphology of C. elegans motor neurons

Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory ( E/I ) neurotransmission is critical for optimal brain function ( Tao et al., 2014 ). Disruptions in this balance are commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders ( Bozzi et al., 2018; Coghlan et al., 2012; Oblak et al., 2009 ). In particular, deficits in inhibitory ( GABAergic ) signaling have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and other related physiopathological conditions ( Oblak et al

. Since the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO is one of the main targets of DAF-18/PTEN signaling, we analyzed the morphology of GABAergic motor neurons in daf-16/FOXO null mutants. These animals also exhibit an increased number of defects in GABAergic commissures compared to the wild type ( Figure 3C ). Given that daf-18 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues ( Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ), we asked whether DAF-18/PTEN acts autonomously in GABAergic neurons to ensure proper development

. Mutations in PTEN are linked with ASDs ( Rademacher and Eickholt, 2019 ). KGDs, which force the endogenous production of Ketone Bodies ( KBs ), have proved to be effective for the treatment of neurological disorders associated with E/I imbalances, such as epilepsy and, more recently, ASD ( Neal et al., 2008; Lambrechts et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021 ). It has been shown that the KB βHB induces DAF-16/FOXO activity ( Edwards et al., 2014 )

Mutations in daf-18/PTEN are linked to neurodevelopmental defects from worms to mammals ( Chen et al., 2015; Christensen et al., 2011; Kennedy et al., 2013 ). Moreover, decreased activity of PTEN produces E/I disequilibrium and the development of seizures in mice ( van Diepen and Eickholt, 2008 ). The mechanisms underlying this imbalance are not clear. Our results demonstrate that reduced DAF-18/PTEN activity in C

., 2017; Yudkoff et al., 2008 ). We demonstrate here that dietary supplementation of the ketone body βHB ameliorates morphological and functional defects in GABAergic motor neurons of daf-18/PTEN mutants. Although ketone bodies were historically viewed as simple energy substrates, they are now recognized as signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes, including neuroprotection and neurodevelopment. Our results suggest that βHB acts early in development to induce DAF-16/FOX activity, thereby rescuing GABAergic neurodevelopment in d-18/PT mutants

Our results demonstrate that d-18/EN and d-16/FOX mutants exhibit defects in GABAergic neurodevelopment, while cholinergic neurons remain unaffected. This suggests that DAF-18/EN acts specifically in GABAergic neurons to ensure proper development and function. The PI3K/Akt pathway is conserved in C. elegans ( Parad and Rkun,1998 Ogg and Ruvun,199 ) and plays a key role in neurodevelopment. We found that d-18/EN mutants exhibit hyperactivation of the PIK pathway, leading to decreased D-16/FOX activity in GABAergic neurons. Our results suggest that the PIK/Akt pathway is involved in GABAergic neurodevelopment and that D-18EN acts as a negative regulator of this pathway in GABAergic neurons

The PIK/Akt pathway is conserved in C. elegans and plays a role in neurodevelopment ( Parad and Ruvun,199 Ogg Ruvun,199 ). We found that d-18EN mutants exhibit hyperactivation of the PIK pathway, leading to decreased D-FOX in GABAergic neurons. Our results suggest the PI/Akt is involved in GABA neurodevelopment and d-EN acts as a negative regulator in GABA neurons

The PIK/Akt pathway is conserved in C. elegans and plays a role in neurodevelopment ( Parad and Ruv, Ogg Ruv ) We found d-EN exhibit hyper of the PI pathway leading to D- in GABA neurons Our suggest PIkt is in GABA and d acts as negative in G

    Title: 
    Abstract: Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.

   . In summary, this study demonstrated the function and mechanism of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation, and highlighted the function of innate immune factors including cytokines against coronaviruses transmission, thus provide potential therapeutic targets for viral control.

In the present study, we explored the function of innate immune factors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, IL-1β inhibited various SARS-CoV-2 variants and other beta-coronaviruses spike-induced cell-cell fusion

. Notably, we identified that IL-1β, which is the key factor of inflammatory response, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia formation in various cells by activating RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo

. Moreover, fluorescence staining showed that SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells fused with neighboring cells, promoting viral transmission in the airway epithelial cells, while IL-1β induced the formation of actin bundles to restrict the syncytia formation and further viral transmission ( Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D )

. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation, preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading ( Figure 7—figure supplement 3 ). These findings revealed a critical function for proinflammatory cytokines to control viral infection

. To this end, it was found that IL-1β reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein levels compared to the control group during such infection both in HEK293T-ACE2 ( Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) and in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 2G ). Meanwhile, IL-1β inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation ( Figure 2H and I and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C ). Thus, these results verified that IL-1β inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in various target cells

. Together, these data revealed that IL-1β induced the formation of actin bundles at the cell-cell junction of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells through RhoA/ROCK pathway, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion

. These results indicated that preventing the formation of RhoA/ROCK-mediated actin bundles at cell-cell junction promotes SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion. To demonstrate the role of IL-1β in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in vivo, BALB/c mice were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 B. 1. 351 after IL-1β or IL-1RA+IL-1β pre-treatment ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A )

., 2021 ). With another note, IL-1 blockade significantly decreased the neutralizing activity of serous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients ( Della-Torre et al., 2021 ). According to our finding that both IL-1β and IL-1α are able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, inhibition of IL-1 signaling may have abolished the antiviral function of IL-1, thus failing to restrict virus-induced syncytia formation and transmission

. These variants have presented significant challenges to the design and development of vaccines and therapeutic agents ( Zhou et al., 2020 ). In order to discover novel strategies to control the virus, it is important to understand host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion ( also known as syncytia formation ) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells, neurons, and glia ( Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023 )

. Accordingly, immunofluorescent staining also showed that TLR ligands-stimulated THP-1 cell culture supernatants significantly reduced the area of syncytium during SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 1H and I ). Therefore, these data suggested that host factors secreted by activated innate immune cells inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion

., 2021 ). Lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which subsequently recruit and activate innate immune cells, leading to COVID-19 pathology ( Barnett et al., 2023 ). In this process, tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation primarily by releasing inflammatory cytokines ( Sefik et al., 2022 )

. Elevated IL-1β levels in severe COVID-19 patients is central to innate immune response as it induces the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines ( Tahtinen et al., 2022 ). In addition, IL-1α is also secreted during SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Xiao et al., 2021 ). Of note, several therapeutic strategies have employed the inhibition of IL-1 signal in an attempt to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Huet et al., 2020; Ucciferri et al., 2020 )

. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion, IL-1β also reduced bioluminescence signal ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7B and C ), S2’ cleavage ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7D and E ), and the area of syncytium ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7F and G ) in these cell-cell fusion systems. Thus, IL-1β possesses a broad spectrum to inhibit cell-cell fusion induced by different coronaviruses

. Importantly, Y-27632 treatment prevented the formation of IL-1β-induced actin bundles at cell-cell junctions, thus promoted syncytia formation and further viral transmission ( Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B ). Furthermore, we treated BALB/c mice with PBS, IL-1β, or Y-27632+IL-1β ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2C ), then isolated the lung tissue cells for authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection

. Considering the higher mRNA level of IL1B than IL1A, as well as the classical release pathway of IL-1β from innate immune cells ( Weber et al., 2010 ), we applied IL-1β for further experiments. In order to validate the effect of IL-1β on cell-cell fusion during authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pre-treated ACE2-expressing cells with IL-1β before inoculating Delta or WT authentic SARS-CoV-2. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and N protein 24 hpi ( Figure 2E )

., 2004 ) or MERS-CoV ( Arabi et al., 2018 ), the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed, suggesting the importance of innate immune factors in viral clearance. Innate immune cells express Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), and TLR-mediated signaling induces robust production of inflammatory cytokines ( Medzhitov, 2001 ). In the current work, we screened the role of soluble proinflammatory cytokines on the SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion

. Taken together, IL-1β prevents the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through inducing the formation of actin bundles via the RhoA/ROCK pathway in vivo.

. These data suggested that TLR-knockout or inhibitors targeting the respective TLR signaling prevented innate immune cells from releasing IL-1β into supernatants, which led to failed inhibition of SARSV-2-induced syncytia in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 1 and 1—figure supplement 1 and 2 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings. We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Contrary to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Taken together, we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.

   . This underlines the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. Here, we investigated the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila using an in vivo electrophysiological approach. We recently demonstrated that IPC activity is strongly modulated by locomotion on fast timescales ( Liessem et al., 2023 )

To advance our understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis, we analyzed the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila. Our in vivo patch clamp recordings revealed that IPC activity is diminished during starvation and rebounds after glucose feeding. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating an accumulation of DILPs ( Géminard et al., 2009; Ikeya et al., 2002; Rajan and Perrimon, 2012; Bai et al., 2012; Sudhakar et al

. Hence, insulin release is modulated by enteroendocrine signals. Drosophila IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian beta cells and presumably sense glucose in the circulating hemolymph to release insulin in response to increases in glucose concentration. Previous ex vivo studies suggested that IPCs, like pancreatic beta cells, sense glucose cell-autonomously ( Fridell et al., 2009; Kréneisz et al., 2010 )

., 2003 ) which is derived from glucose. When we extended our experiments, we found that trehalose perfusion did not affect IPC activity either, strengthening the idea that IPCs do not directly sense changes in hemolymph sugar levels. Therefore, our findings suggest that, similar to mammals, IPC activity and hence, insulin release, is not simply modulated by hemolymph sugar concentration in Drosophila. Several pathways could contribute to this

., 2015 ). A subset of octopaminergic neurons expressing Drosophila insulin receptor ( dInR ) are necessary for the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity ( Yang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016 ) implicating that IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior. While much is known about carbohydrate metabolism and insulin signaling in Drosophila ( Broughton et al., 2005; Enell et al., 2010; Kapan et al., 2012; Luo et al

. Hence, our findings not only contribute to the increasing body of research on insulin signaling, but also pave the way for future research analyzing the intricacies of Drosophila neuroendocrine networks governing nutrient sensing and behavior.

. These DH44Ns also have strong effects on locomotor activity, which are antagonistic to those of IPCs. Our findings imply distinct mechanisms by which IPCs and DH44PINs sense changes in nutritional state, underlining the significance of multiple pathways in orchestrating Drosophila’s response to nutritional state changes and ensuring metabolic homeostasis.

To characterize the electrophysiological activity of IPCs in different nutritional states, we performed in vivo patch-clamp recordings from IPCs in fed and starved Drosophila ( Figure 1A–C ). First, flies were fed ad libitum, and the IPC baseline activity was determined by recording their spontaneous activity in glucose-free extracellular saline in a 5 min window. The baseline firing rate varied between individual IPCs and ranged from 0 to 1. 4 Hz ( Figure 1D )

. We further establish that the nutritional state strongly modulates locomotor activity, and that IPCs play a small but significant role in this. In addition, we confirm that another set of modulatory neurons adjacent to the IPCs, DH44PINs, are sensitive to glucose perfusion. While DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity on short timescales, DH44 neurons outside the PI ( DH44Ns ) form strong inhibitory connections to IPCs

. Using electrophysiological approaches, we unraveled the complex activity dynamics of IPCs and DH44PINs and identified differences in their activity patterns during various nutritional states. The discovery of an ‘incretin-like’ effect in flies suggests that important aspects of gut-brain signaling are conserved across vertebrate and invertebrate species

. These parallels suggest that the regulation of insulin signaling in response to nutrient availability is an evolutionarily conserved strategy, underscoring its fundamental role in survival and metabolic homeostasis across species. Mammalian pancreatic beta cells sense glucose levels in the blood and release insulin accordingly ( Matschinsky, 1996; MacDonald et al., 2005 ). However, this process is much more complex than initially assumed

., 1964; DeFronzo et al., 1978 ). This effect is driven by gut-derived neuropeptides collectively referred to as ‘incretin hormones’ in mammals ( Creutzfeldt, 1979; Kazafeos, 2011 ). Recently, incretin-like hormones were also described in Drosophila ( Yoshinari et al., 2021; Alfa et al., 2015 ). We were surprised to find that IPCs were not responsive to glucose perfusion. To confirm that this was not due to shortcomings of our experimental protocol, we recorded from DH44PINs

. We conclude that starvation-induced hyperactivity is mildly affected by IPCs, but predominantly controlled by populations of modulatory neurons other than IPCs, including OANs. Our experiments established that IPC activity is modulated by the nutritional state, and that IPCs are sensitive to glucose ingestion, similar to pancreatic beta cells. Like beta cells, IPCs have been suggested to directly sense changes in extracellular glucose concentration in ex vivo studies ( Fridell et al

. In summary, the reduced IPC activity we observed in starved and aged flies may be crucial for metabolic adjustments required for survival. Notably, similar mechanisms have been observed in mammals, where reduced insulin signaling and increased insulin sensitivity during fasting or dietary restriction contribute to enhanced metabolic efficiency and longevity

. Furthermore, DH44PIN activation slightly increased the FV but did not lead to stopping, suggesting that DH44PINs contribute to starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas other DH44Ns drive stopping and proboscis extension. In conclusion, our study sheds light onto the intricate connections between neuroendocrine signaling, nutrient sensing, and behavior in Drosophila

. These results signify a causal link between glucose homeostasis in the gut and the brain and pave the way for further studies investigating the evolutionary conservation of the incretin effect across mammals and insects. We observed that IPC activity increased over a timescale of hours, which is longer compared to the fast insulin response in mammals, where insulin typically peaks within an hour of feeding ( Holst, 2019 )

. DILP6 mRNA in the fat body is upregulated during starvation, which has been shown to decrease systemic insulin signaling by the suppression of insulin release from IPCs ( Bai et al., 2012 ), potentially contributing to mechanisms regulating insulin sensitivity in flies. Furthermore, we observed that IPC activity did not recover on the HP diet, which also resulted in poor survival rates. This may indicate that insulin signaling is impaired in flies if they only feed on protein

., 2014; Jennings, 2011 ). In Drosophila, 14 IPCs, which are analogous to human pancreatic beta cells, reside in the pars intercerebralis ( PI ) of the brain ( Nässel and Winther, 2010 ). These IPCs secrete Drosophila insulin-like peptides ( DILPs ) and are sensitive to changes in the metabolic state ( Fridell et al., 2009; Kim and Neufeld, 2015; Barber et al., 2016; Géminard et al., 2009 ), the behavioral state ( Liessem et al., 2023 ), the circadian rhythm ( Kim et al. 2015 ) and the environment ( Kim et al. 201 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.

   . Finally, we showed how iPSCs could be imaged with high temporal resolution using CARE for studies of cytokinesis, an essential dynamic cellular process. Altogether, this work provides the basis for a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, which will be used to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro.

., 2018; Drubin and Hyman, 2017 ). Here, we used the split mNeonGreen system for endogenous tagging in human iPSCs ( Figure 1A ). First, we engineered a human iPS cell line that constitutively expresses the mNG21-10 fragment. We validated this cell line extensively and named it ‘smNG2-P’ ( split mNeonGreen2 parental cell line ). As a proof-of-concept, we efficiently targeted multiple genes for endogenous tagging with mNG211, and clonally isolated several tagged iPS cell lines

. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and provides protocols to efficiently generate and study endogenous tags in human iPSCs.

., 2017 ). This interaction is characterized by a high complementation efficiency and is irreversible once the reconstituted protein has folded ( Feng et al., 2019; Köker et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the split mNeonGreen2 protein retains most of the brightness of the original mNeonGreen ( Feng et al., 2017 ). This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in cells where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al

. g. Husser et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2017 ), the generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput. The recently developed self-complementing split fluorescent proteins can be used as tools for large-scale endogenous tagging ( Feng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019; Kamiyama et al., 2016; Tamura et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020 )

Recent advances in genetic engineering have accelerated the development of tools for fundamental research. Endogenous tags are particularly valuable as they enable the visualization of protein behavior in live cells at endogenous expression levels

. In this study, we generated a fully validated human iPS cell line expressing mNG21-10 for efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in human stem cells capable of differentiating into any cell type. The 201B7 smNG2-P cell line is heterozygous for the mNG21-10 expression cassette which was integrated at the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus

. Importantly, the stability of fluorescence levels in endogenously tagged cell lines and the absence of localization artifacts compared to over-expressed transgenes makes this system attractive for quantitative measurements in live cells ( Husser et al., 2022 ). The goal of endogenous tagging in iPSCs is to enable live imaging studies of diverse cellular processes for comparative studies among different human cell types

., 2017 ). Although it is difficult to compare editing efficiencies across studies, endogenous tagging by HDR is very inefficient. Our results are consistent with iPSCs being more challenging to edit compared to other cell types, and mNG211 integrating at higher frequency than larger tags. The split mNeonGreen system also enables endogenous tagging on the scale of hundreds to thousands of proteins in parallel

. After these validation and quality control steps, we chose clone 28 as the AAVS1-mNG21-10 cell line, which we hereafter refer to as ‘smNG2-P’ ( split mNeonGreen2 parental cell line ). Since fluorescence could be reconstituted by expressing the mNG11 fragment in the smNG2-P cell line, we aimed to integrate mNG211 into different endogenous loci. We selected 17 genes for tagging, some of which had been previously endogenously tagged with the split mNG system ( e. g

. Self-complementing split fluorescent proteins have been used for efficient endogenous tagging, and this approach was recently used for the construction of the first library of endogenous tags in HEK293 cells, with 1310 proteins tagged in mixed populations enriched by FACS ( Cho et al., 2022 ). While this library is a powerful resource for the community, researchers will need to generate single clones of individual tagged proteins before they can be studied

., 2022 ). Large-scale endogenous tagging in HEK293 cells was recently achieved by the OpenCell project, with 1310 proteins tagged to date ( Cho et al., 2022 ). However, while this library will be a valuable resource for the community, there is a need to study protein function in other cell types, where the mechanisms regulating biological processes could vary drastically

. Alternative methods such as fixation and antibody staining can also be used for more sensitive detection of weakly expressed endogenous tags ( O’Hagan et al., 2021 ). Importantly, the expression levels of 9 mNG211-tagged proteins in iPSCs ( Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1U ) were consistent with RNA-seq data ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Iwasaki et al., 2022 )

., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016; Mahdessian et al., 2021 ). The mNG211 fragment is only 16 amino acids long, so it can be inserted into the genome by HDR using a repair template with short homology arms ( generally 40–80 bp ), which can be purchased commercially as a single-stranded oligo-deoxynucleotide ( ssODN ). This enables large-scale tagging using commercially synthesized ssODNs and sgRNAs to target multiple proteins in parallel ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016 )

. Tagging efficiency with mNG211 in iPSCs was lower than in mouse embryos ( 40 to 100% of injected embryos; O’Hagan et al., 2021 ), and lower than tagging with GFP11 in HEK293 cells ( <1 to 56% tagged alleles; Cho et al., 2022 ). However, endogenous tagging with mNG211 was overall more efficient than endogenous tagging with full-length mEGFP in iPSCs ( mostly <0. 1 to 4%, and up to 24% GFP-positive cells; Roberts et al., 2017 )

. For comparison, endogenous tagging with full-length fluorescent proteins requires the assembly of large repair templates, which limits the number of proteins that can be tagged at once. We also found that low endogenous expression levels can limit the detection of tagged proteins by flow cytometry, similar to previous studies ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016; O’Hagan et al., 2021 ), requiring microscopy with highly sensitive cameras or detectors

. The endogenously tagged iPS cell lines can be used to study the mechanisms controlling different cellular processes in healthy cells and how they vary with cell type. Our knowledge of human cytokinesis is derived from transformed and/or cancerous, differentiated cell lines and has not been studied in human pluripotent stem cells. Cytokinesis is dynamic and requires imaging over long periods of time ( tens to hundreds of minutes ) at frequent intervals

. Timelapse imaging of several weakly expressed cytokinesis genes that were endogenously tagged in iPSCs revealed new insights into how cytokinesis occurs in these cells. Imaging the more weakly expressed genes required the use of an image restoration algorithm to alleviate cell toxicity and obtain high-quality images with high temporal resolution

. To study cytokinesis in human iPSCs, we imaged the mNG211-tagged cell lines from metaphase onwards. After a few minutes of imaging using standard optical settings, iPSCs stopped dividing and detached from the coverslip, independently of laser wavelength ( data not shown ), suggesting that iPSCs are more sensitive to photo-toxicity than transformed and cancerous cell lines. Moreover, endogenous protein levels are low, requiring higher exposure times

. We found that iPSCs are particularly sensitive to phototoxicity, making it difficult to image weakly expressed endogenous proteins. To alleviate this, we used a neural network-based image restoration algorithm to improve image quality and temporal resolution ( Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). This allowed us to study highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSC with high temporal resolution and spatial resolution. This is the first study of cytokinesis in human iPSC using endogenously tagged proteins

In conclusion, we generated a validated humanPS cell line expressing the m21 fragment of the splitNeGreen protein (NG-10 ) for efficient endogenous tagging with the short fragment m211. We demonstrated that this system enables live imaging of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSC with high temporal and spatial resolution. This represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human stem cells, which will be used to study protein function in human cells across cell types in vitro.
Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through microelectrodes that is compatible with electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity before and after the lesion. A custom current source was built to ensure stable current delivery throughout the lesion, for repeated lesions, and across different electrode types and animals. The technique was validated using histology ex vivo and in vivo, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after the lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter over location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after the lesion. The technique can be used in many areas of cortex, several species, and theoretically with multielectrode probes. The low-cost lesion device can easily be adopted into existing electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable causal investigations of the neuronal population's role in circuit, while providing new insight into reorganization after loss.

The method was demonstrated using a Utah multielect probe testing a U-Pro in vivo rabbit cortex. There are no limitations that prevent the specific technique from working with any multielect probe. The device supplies voltage to damage the cortex while maintaining precision in delivered (error not exceeding 10A). A combination of current and parameters was found to create a lesion in rhes macques, first tested in sheep and pig brains, then in vivo anesthet pigs. The lesion is controlled by the amplitude and duration of current through two electrodes, although the extent varies due to anatomical variation. This is an initial design of the device and examination of lesion parameters. The technique has been tested to ensure proper function, emphasizing that this is a preliminary exploration of the full potential of electrolytic lesion through microelect in implementation and use in neuroscience.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

   . If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, however, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. Only a few have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar ( Arce et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2015; Muth et al., 2020 ), but the conclusions of these studies are contradictory

. Here, we use a combination of sensitive behavioural assays and electrophysiology to test in detail whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. Feeding assays using freely moving foragers make it possible to assess if bees detect and avoid potential toxins in food ( Ma et al., 2016 ). To definitively test whether bumblebees detect neonicotinoids on their mouthparts, we quantified the structure of feeding when the mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees ( B

. impatiens ) using methods similar to ours reported that bees are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids, consistent with the idea that they cannot detect the pesticides ( Muth et al., 2020 ). Thus, whether or not bumblebees can taste neonicotinoids in food remains unresolved. Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars which are different to those reported for any other insect species

. However, we also failed to find evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides in water elicited spikes in any galeal GRNs including the nutrient/sugar sensing neurons. For this reason, we concluded that bees could not taste neonicotinoids in nectar or on their own in water. This conclusion, however, has been challenged by a study in free-flying B. terrestris foragers ( Arce et al., 2018 )

Gill et al., 2012; Henry et al., 2012; Parkinson et al., 2022a; Schneider et al., 2012b; Williamson et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2015 ). Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions; bees consume the solution, and then a change in behaviour or performance is recorded

. In addition, we comprehensively tested these solutions on the gustatory receptor neurons in the A-type sensilla on the galea and the labial palps of the bees’ mouthparts using electrophysiology to determine whether sensilla in multiple locations are able to detect neonicotinoids ( IMD, CLO, and TMX ) and the previously untested sulfoxamine pesticide, sulfoxaflor ( SFX )

. What’s more, these small changes in the rate of spiking did not translate into features that the clustering algorithm could use to differentiate pesticide laced stimuli from the control OSR solution. From these data, we conclude that the buff-tailed bumblebee’s mouthparts do not have mechanisms for the detection and avoidance of common cholinergic pesticides in nectar

. No significant differences were detected in the responses of the labial palp neurons to the pesticide solutions ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). To test whether all concentrations of pesticides go undetected by bees, we stimulated GRNs with 0. 1 mM of each pesticide mixed with 10% OSR

. Strikingly, we show that bumblebees do not avoid drinking OSR nectar solutions even when very high concentrations of common pesticides are present. Very high concentrations of these pesticides could produce a small but measurable reduction in the spiking of sugar-sensing GRNs, but these compounds never elicited spikes on their own

., 2015 ). In a two choice assay, we unexpectedly found that when bees were given a choice between sucrose solution and sucrose containing field-relevant doses of IMD and TMX over a 24 hr period, the bees choose the neonicotinoid solution ( Kessler et al., 2015 ). This could indicate that bees find neonicotinoid pesticides phagostimulatory, like sugars

., 2007 ). Using insecticides impacts the health and survival of bees, contributing to the recent population declines of all bee species ( Goulson et al., 2015; Potts et al., 2016; Van der Sluijs et al., 2013; Vanbergen et al., 2013 ). Hundreds of studies have shown that exposure to sublethal concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides ( i. e

Clearly, deeper investigations could determine whether the mouthparts GRNs possess novel gustatory mechanisms for pesticide detection and provide critical information about the risk to bees of consuming the nectar of pesticide-defended crops in the field. They would also elucidate novel mechanisms for the detection of bitter compounds

. terrestris ) were stimulated with nectar-like solutions containing pesticides over a 2 min period ( Ma et al., 2016 ). We specifically tested a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) with field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids

. 1 mM ) added to a 10% OSR solution. Field-relevant concentrations of the pesticides in OSR nectar did not deter the bees from feeding, as the presence of these compounds did not significantly alter the amount of food consumed ( LME, concentration: F4, 297=0. 209, p=0. 933 ), first bout duration ( LME, concentration: F4, 290=0. 648, p=0. 629 ) or cumulative bout duration ( LME, concentration: F4, 288=0. 310, p=0. 871 ) over the 2 min assay period ( Figure 4A–C )

., 2016 ), as we found no electrophysiological evidence to support that bees could taste neonicotinoids ( Kessler et al., 2015 ). This conclusion is consistent with the expectation that a preference resulting from post-ingestive reinforcement caused by amplification of the brain’s response to sugars would be expected to develop following long-term, repeated exposure to a pharmacological compound ( Palmer et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2013 )

. These authors concluded that the only way bees could solve this problem was if they used their sense of taste to identify the preferred solution, arguing that further work needed to be done to identify the mechanism for sensation. Subsequently, however, another study in a different species of bumblebees ( B

. 15% and citric acid ( E330 ) 0. 06% ( Wäckers et al., 2017 ). Bumblebees were provided with freeze-dried honeybee collected pollen ( approximately 10 g ) ( Agralan Growers, Wiltshire, UK ) three times/week. In total, 12 colonies were used for the taste assays and 6 colonies were used for the electrophysiological study. Females ( of unknown age ) were randomly assigned to a treatment and colonies were counterbalanced across treatments to control for intercolony variation

For the first time, we report how populations of GRNs on the bee’s mouthparts respond to stimulation with putatively bitter compounds. We verified that bees do not have mechanisms on their mouthparts that enable them to taste neonicotinoids or sulfoxaflor when these compounds are present in nectar. Neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor did not change the bursting of sugar-sensing neurons in the galea, nor did they elicit or inhibit spikes in labial palp neurons

. A concentration of 0. 1 mM was chosen for the pesticides as this encompasses the higher range of SFX found in the nectar of oilseed ( Brassica nap ) and the lower range of IMD found in the nectar of rapeseed (Brassica nap ). We also tested concentrations of 0.1, 1, 1, 10, and 100 nM of each pesticide in 10% sucrose solution and found that bees did not avoid these solutions even when they contained lethal doses of the pesticides. Only high concentrations of pesticides slightly reduced the rate of spiking of sugarensing neurons but never elicited spikes on their own. We conclude that the buffailed bumblebee’s mouthparts do not have mechanisms for the detection and avoidance of cholinergic pesticides in nectar

We also found that bees did not avoid OS nectar solutions even when very high concentrations of pesticides were present. High concentrations of pesticides produced a small but measurable reduction in the spiking of sugarensing GRNs but never elicited spikes on their own. This suggests that bees are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops as they rarely contact nectar with body parts other than their mouthparts. Our data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using their mouthparts.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited. Here, we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots. In wildlife and humans, parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales, we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.

   . knowlesi ( Moyes et al., 2016; Stark et al., 2019 ), associations between landscape and variation in the prevalence of simian Plasmodium spp. in primates have not been explored. We aimed to ( 1 ) assemble a georeferenced dataset of P. knowlesi in NHPs; ( 2 ) evaluate variation in NHP P. knowlesi prevalence by geographic region; and ( 3 ) assess environmental and spatial risk factors for P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs across Southeast Asia.

. In Sabah, human prevalence of P. knowlesi infection has recently been shown to be specifically associated with recent loss of intact forest, agricultural activities, and fragmentation across multiple localised spatial scales ( Brock et al., 2019; Fornace et al., 2019b; Fornace et al., 2016 ). Prevalence of the pathogen in reservoir hosts is one of three crucial factors determining the force of infection in zoonotic spillover events ( Murray and Daszak, 2013 )

., 2021 ). We hypothesise that prevalence of P. knowlesi in primate host species is spatially heterogeneous and that higher prevalence is partially driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to the strong associations described between land use, land cover and human P. knowlesi risk. This study is the first to systematically assess P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs at a regional scale, and across a wide range of habitats

. Prediction intervals indicate high heterogeneity of estimates within regions, consistent with expectations of high variability of prevalence across individual study sites. Detailed forest plots for individual prevalence estimates can be found in Appendix 3—figure 2. Covariate data and P. knowlesi prevalence data were used to fit additional models to explore the relationships between localised landscape configuration and NHP malaria prevalence

. Notwithstanding limitations, this study highlights the marked spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates in NHPs. Given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology, it is essential that infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs are considered in future public health interventions.

. knowlesi in NHPs. Findings provide evidence that P. knowlesi in primate hosts is partly driven by landscape modification across Southeast Asia. While the full complexity is not captured by the covariates used, it is clear that P. knowlesi infection in NHPs is not restricted to densely forested areas

., 2020 ). Indeed, Malaysia was the first country not to qualify for malaria elimination due to ongoing presence of zoonotic malaria and the WHO updated the guidelines to reflect zoonotic malaria as a public health threat ( World Health Organization, 2021 ). Emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi infections has been linked to changes in land cover and land use ( Fornace et al., 2021 ). While sporadic cases have been reported across Southeast Asia, including in Indonesia ( Setiadi et al

To quantify regional heterogeneity in simian cases of P. knowlesi, a one-stage meta-analysis of prevalence ( number positive out of the number sampled ) was conducted on primate malaria survey data. Overall pooled estimate for P. knowlesi prevalence was 11. 99% ( CI95% 9. 35–15. 26 ). Overall heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Substantial between-study heterogeneity ( I2 ≥75% ) was found across all prevalence records ( I2=80. 5%; CI95% 77. 3–83. 1 )

. Systematic tools developed for epidemiological studies of disease prevalence in human populations are rarely applied to the study of wildlife disease prevalence; however, such tools can be used to capture the scale and contrast required in macroecological studies to quantify disease burdens regionally. Furthermore, while recent research has shown the impact of deforestation on the distribution of macaques in the context of P. knowlesi ( Moyes et al., 2016; Stark et al

. Despite this, very little is known of the impact of rapid landscape change on the distribution of P. knowlesi in NHPs. Literature on the impacts of fragmentation on primates tends to focus on primate density and abundance ( Link et al., 2010; Zunino et al., 2007 ). What is known is that effects of land cover changes on primate-pathogen dynamics are highly variable and context-specific

Strong links have been identified between land use and land cover change and ecosystem perturbation that favours the transmission of vector-borne diseases ( Loh et al., 2016 ). Prevalence of P. knowlesi in macaques is likely to be a crucial determinant of human infection risk, and more representative estimates of P. knowlesi prevalence derived here can better inform regional transmission risk models. This study also characterises landscape risk factors for heightened prevalence of P

Zoonotic infectious diseases arise from the spillover of pathogens into human populations, typically from a reservoir in wildlife hosts. Anthropogenic land use and land cover change have now been widely linked to infectious disease outbreaks ( Brock et al., 2019; Davidson et al., 2019a; Loh et al., 2016 )

., 2019; Grigg et al., 2017 ). At the same time, habitat fragmentation can have detrimental impact on wildlife population viability, with reduced host species occupancy and reduced disease burden in highly disturbed habitats ( Hanski and Ovaskainen, 2000 ). Disentangling this interplay is essential to inform ecological strategies for surveillance and mitigation of diseases in regions undergoing landscape change ( Fornace et al., 2021 ). Zoonotic P

Currently, distribution of P. knowlesi cases is thought to be restricted to the predicted ranges of known vector and host species ( Davidson et al., 2019b ), although recent studies have also identified other NHPs found to be harbouring P. knowlesi. This includes Stump-tailed macaques ( M. arctoides ), which are now considered to be another natural reservoir ( Fungfuang et al., 2020 )

This study focused on the simian malaria Plasmodium knowlesi across Southeast Asia, within 28°30'00. 0"N, 92°12'00. 0"E and 11°00'00. 0"S, 141°00'00. 0"E.

Adjusting for all other covariates in the model, we identified strong evidence of an effect between increasing tree canopy cover and higher prevalence of P. knowlesi in NHPs within a 5 km radius ( aOR = 1. 38, CI95% 1. 19–1. 60; p<0. 0001 ). Evidence was also found for an association between likelihood of P. knowlesi and higher degrees of habitat fragmentation ( PARA ) within 5 km ( aOR = 1. 17, CI95% 1. 02–1. 34, p<0. 0281 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Belidae were reconstructed as having a Gondwanan origin, with the two extant subfamilies Belinae and Oxycoryninae originating in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively ( Figure 2 ). The most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae were reconstructed as Pinopsida ( 0. 53 ) or Angiospermae ( 0. 43 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Supplementary file 2 ). In Belinae, Pinopsida were the most likely ancestral host plants ( 0

., 2007; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2018; McKenna, 2011; Figure 1 ). Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms, as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018 )

. The two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana ( McIntyre et al., 2017 ) and both have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. In the East Gondwana clade, Belinae, the divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus was estimated at 44. 7 Ma ( 55. 9–34. 5 Ma ), during the Paleocene–Eocene separation of South America and Australia ( Lawver et al., 1992; Briggs, 1995; McIntyre et al

. Sphinctobelus ) and in single species ( e. g. Isacantha, Rhicnobelus ) ; however, there are some cases known in Belidae where the use of plant organs is apparently plastic and opportunistic ( e. g. Apagobelus brevirostris ( Lea ) reared from both stems and cones of Araucaria; Zimmerman, 1994 ). A Gondwanan origin was recovered for Belidae at c. 138 Ma, when South America and Australia were connected via Antarctica

., 2018 ). However, angiosperm families known to be belid hosts, such as Arecaceae, Hydnoraceae, Balanophoraceae, and Fabaceae, did not diversify until the Cretaceous ( Barba-Montoya et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019 ). During the early evolutionary history of Belidae, conifer lineages were dominant ( Crisp and Cook, 2011; Anderson et al., 2007; Wang and Ran, 2014 ), consistent with Pinopsida being the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae

. We sought to answer two main questions about the distribution and host plant associations of crown group Belidae: ( 1 ) is the development of larvae of Agnesiotidini and Pachyurini ( Belinae ) and Oxycraspedina ( Oxycoryninae ) in conifer hosts an ancient, primary association ( Farrell, 1998 ) or the result of more recent, secondary colonization, and ( 2 ) how did the interplay between biogeographical process and host plant shifts influence and shape the trophic associations of belids?

. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2019 ). The present paper addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the biogeography and evolution of host plant associations in the family Belidae ( belid weevils ), an ancient group of phytophagous beetles whose extant species exhibit specialized trophic associations with gymnosperms and flowering plants

., 2002; Marvaldi, 2005 ). Even though our reconstruction provides support for their ancestral hosts most likely being the Pinopsida, which is in accordance with our clade age estimates, angiosperm hosts cannot be completely ruled out, considering that crown angiosperms are now thought to have originated earlier than Belidae, in the interval between the late Permian and the latest Jurassic ( 256–149 Ma ) ( Barba-Montoya et al., 2018 )

The evolutionary interplay between plant-feeding ( phytophagous ) insects and vascular plants has fundamentally shaped terrestrial biodiversity for over 400 million years ( e. g. Ehrlich and Raven, 1964; Farrell et al., 1992; Wilf, 2008; Misof et al., 2014; Swain et al., 2022 ). The fossil record has provided insights into the historical context and evolutionary processes that have shaped modern insect-plant interactions ( Labandeira and Currano, 2013 )

. As mentioned above, Homalocerus and Trichophthalmus might form the earliest-branching lineage of Belini. Therefore, the more plausible scenario for host plant shifts is a single shift to ferns from conifers during the Early to Middle Paleogene, perhaps tracking the radiation of ferns in the late Cretaceous ( Schneider et al., 2004; Schuettpelz and Pryer, 2009 )

. Angiosperms introduced novel ecological niches and resources, leading to the diversification of phytophagous insects and a reconfiguration of insect-plant associations ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; Wilf, 2008; McKenna et al., 2009; Mckenna et al., 2015; Swain et al., 2022 ). By the end of the Mesozoic, the continents had rifted into nearly their present forms, though their positions would continue to change

. Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, while Laurasia became North America and Eurasia. On account of their extraordinary taxonomic diversity and varied trophic interactions with contemporary gymnosperms and flowering plants, beetles ( order Coleoptera; >400, 000 described extant species ) have been widely used as models to study the evolution of diversity at the insect-plant interface ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al

. Based on the ASR analysis, branches of the host plants were used for larval development by ancestral Belidae with the high possibility ( 0. 87 ), with a single shift to flowers and fruits ( of Angiospermae ) in Oxycorynina and at least three shifts to strobili, two to strobili of Pinopsida in Pachyurini and Oxycraspedina and one to ( pollen ) cones of Cycadopsida in Allocorynina ( Figure 2 ).

. The larvae of ancestral Belidae were reconstructed as having developed endophytically in branches ( not strobili ) of their host plants, which is consistent with some previous hypotheses ( Marvaldi et al., 2002; Marvaldi, 2005 )

. Gymnosperms ( cycads, conifers and relatives ), the dominant plant group during the Mesozoic Era, thrived from the Permian to the Cretaceous period, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems and forming intimate associations with many groups of phytophagous insects ( Anderson et al., 2007 )

. g. McKenna et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018 ), the phylogeny and evolution of Belidae have not been explored using molecular data. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses and divergence dating of belid weevils to investigate their relationships and evolution. We also reconstructed ancestral states of host plant associations and undertook a biogeographical analysis to explore geographical patterns of diversification and the evolution of host plant organ and taxon associations

. Based on our phylogeny estimate, the host plant shift to Angiospermae may have occurred during the branching of Belini in the Middle to Late Paleogene. Possible host shifts to ferns in the Paleogene in the Neotropical genera Trichophthalmus and Homalocerus must have occurred before the shift to angiosperms in Oxycninae ( Figure 2 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. 

    Supporting Text:
    We have used genetic data taken from hepatocellular tumours at high spatial resolution ( Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022 ) to analyse the early evolution of a tumour in vivo. We are not the first to link spatial tumour sampling with evolution: on a larger spatial scale, phylogenetic comparison of samples from primary and metastatic tumours has elucidated the dynamics of metastasis ( Jones et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016; Alves et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020 )

., 2004; Durrett, 2013; Bozic et al., 2013; Foo and Michor, 2014; Heyde et al., 2019 ). They also form the basis of almost all population-genetic approaches to analyzing tumour data ( Attolini et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018 ). To tell between these two different evolutionary dynamics, we use high-resolution data on the spatial distribution of mutations found in solid tumours

. From the observed spatial distribution of mutations, it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution: Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour, or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour? What is the interplay between the tissue dynamics of the tumour and its genetic evolution

. We use whole-exome mutation data obtained from hepatocellular carcinomas and published previously ( Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022 ). From these snapshots of late-stage tumours we infer how the tumours grew in earlier stages. To this end, we develop metrics of intra-tumour heterogeneity which leverage the information from the spatial position of all samples.

. This is in contrast to surface growth, where a specific dispersal mechanism has been postulated to account for the observed spatial distribution of mutations ( Waclaw et al., 2015 ). To probe how this migration of cells between different regions of a tumour affects multi-region sampling, we look at the number of mutations detectable in a limited number of samples

., 2018; Caravagna et al., 2018 ). The mode of growth of a tumour affects the resulting genetic diversity of a tumour ( Noble et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022 ). Here, we have used the spatial information contained in data based on hundreds of samples from single tumours. We found that the tumour evolved under uniform volume growth; there was no evidence of spatial constraints leading to radially outward growth

. Under surface growth and neutral evolution, the number of cell divisions since tumorigenesis, and hence the number of mutations found in a cell, increases with distance from the tumour centre. However, we do not find this signature of surface growth in the tumour data. Instead, we find that the number of mutations at different distances from the centre is compatible with volume growth ( see Appendix 3—figure 4 ). Similarly, the dataset of Li et al

. This implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution, since standard tools of population genetics, like the site-frequency spectrum, are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information. One particular question concerns two different modes in which a tumour can grow; surface growth and volume growth. Under surface growth, the cancer cells divide predominantly at the border with healthy tissue

., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Lomakin et al., 2021 ). These techniques allow assaying the genomic information almost at single-cell level in intact tissue sections. Currently, the attainable sequencing depth is too low to identify point mutations across different parts of the tumour. However, it is clear that the coming-of-age of spatial genomics will bring new opportunities to understand the past evolution of a population of tumour cells from a late-stage snapshot

., 2018; Metzcar et al., 2019 ), which we endow with mutations entering the population at a constant rate per cell division. In this model, each tumour cell is described by a sphere centered on a particular point in 3D space or 2D space, as well as a genome. Each cell division introduces a new point adjacent to its parent in a random ( uniformly distributed ) direction, and each cell death removes a point

. The surface growth mode also has a long history in the modelling of tumour evolution ( Greenspan, 1972; Ward and King, 1997; Baish and Jain, 2000; González-García et al., 2002; Komarova, 2006; Sottoriva et al., 2010; Waclaw et al., 2015; Sottoriva et al., 2015; Iwasaki and Innan, 2017; Sun et al., 2017; van der Heijden et al., 2019 ) and has been used to analyze multi-region tumour sequencing data ( Sottoriva et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017; Chkhaidze et al

Under surface growth, cells divide predominantly near the edge of a tumour. Under volume growth on the other hand, cells divide uniformly across the entire tumour mass. To distinguish these two modes in empirical data, we look at the angle between a line from the tumour centre to a parent clone and from the parent to their offspring, see Figure 2A and Appendix 2

The evolution of a solid tumour is governed by the division, motion, and death of cancer cells. Genetic mutations arising during cell divisions can serve as cell markers to track this dynamics

. We find the same level of dispersal of mutations in off-lattice simulations of growing tissues, where it is due to cells pushing each other out of the way as a part of the growth process. Hence, cells that were initially adjacent to each other and share a mutation can get pushed apart during the course of tumour growth and end up with a large distance between them

. Similarly, the dataset of Li et al., 2022 with three-dimensional sampling also shows the signature of volume growth, both in the distribution of direction angles ( Appendix 2. 2 ) and in the number of mutations as a function of distance from the tumour centre, see Appendix 3. 3. This result is at variance with a recent spatio-phylogenetic analysis performed by Lewinsohn et al., 2023, which finds a signal of surface growth on the same data

. In order to determine the population size the tumour had when the mutations we analysed here arose, we generalize this result to include the effects of spatial sampling and stochastic population dynamics, see Appendix 7. The higher the spatial resolution, the lower the whole-tumour frequency of a detectable mutation can be. For this reason, a high spatial resolution means that late-coming ( low frequency ) mutations can be detected

. Instead, in its early stage, the tumour was balanced precariously between continued growth to macroscopic size and shrinkage: A small increase in the rate of cell death, or a small decrease in the growth rate would have caused the small net growth rate to become negative, possibly even leading to the extinction of the tumour. The high spatial resolution also allows to track changes in the mutational processes over evolutionary time far more easily than in bulk data

. We find that the mutations detected in the samples with high spatial resolution ( surface growth/volume growth analysis and genetic turnover ) arose when the tumour consisted of about 80, 000 cells. The mutations in the whole-exome samples used to measure the dispersion of mutations arose when the tumour size was around 7000 cells.

. For surface growth, the histogram of direction angles shows a pronounced maximum at θ=0 produced by the radial outgrowth of clones ( Figure 2C ), in a simulation of volume growth, we find a flat distribution ( Figure 2D ). These simulations were done with samples placed in the same positions as in the real tumour to eliminate effects from uneven sampling. This result is corroborated by the average number of mutations of a clone as a function of its distance from the tumour centre

. We found that this effect can be highly advantageous when assessing the mutations in a tumour from a limited number of samples: cells carrying a particular mutation can migrate into a spatial region that is far from where it was first detected. This is in contrast to surface growth, where the number of mutations in a region increases with distance from the tumour centre. We also find that the number of mutations in a clone as a function of distance from the tumour centre is compatible with volume growth ( see Appendix 3—figure 4 ). This is in contrast to surface growth, where the number of mutations in a region increases with distance from the tumour centre. The dataset of Li et al. 202 also implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution, since standard tools of population genetics like the site-frequency spectrum are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information. One question concerns different modes in which tumour can grow; surface growth and volume. Under surface, cancer cells divide predominantly at the border with healthy tissue. Under volume, cells divide uniformly across entire tumour mass. To distinguish these modes in empirical, we look the angle between line from tumour centre to parent and parent to offspring, see Figure 2 and Appendix 2

The evolution of tumour is governed by division, motion, and death of cancer cells. Genetic mutations during divisions serve as markers to track this dynamics. We find same dispersal of mutations in lattice simulations of tissues where it due cells pushing each other out as part of growth. Hence cells initially adjacent share mutation get apart during tum growth and end with large between them. Dataset Li et. 202 with three-dimensional also shows signature volume in distribution angles and number as function tum centre, see Appendix 2.2 and 3.

**Key Findings:**

* Tumour cells grow uniformly within the tumour volume, not at the surface
* Mutations are dispersed throughout the tum, not just at the surface
High-resolution data allows tracking of tumour evolution and mutational changes over time
Tumour size when mutations arose was around 80,000 cells
Mutations in whole-exome used to measure dispersion arose when tum was 700 cells

    Title: 
    Abstract: Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Firstly, we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM. Subsequently, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

   ., 2022b ). The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer-form, implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–F; Luan et al., 2006 ). As the transition of C. chinensis from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10 °C and CcTRPM, we next determined the effect of 10 °C treatment and CcTRPM RNAi on the expression of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β

. chinensis. To further elucidate the role of the Bursicon signal in seasonal polyphenism, we identified the Bursicon receptor of CcBurs-R in C. chinensis. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of CcBurs-R were very similar to those of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β, and it also had higher expression in winter-form than summer-form ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )

. 02% ) ( Figure 2H–I ). Together, these data suggest that the two subunits of Bursicon, CcBurs-α, and CcBurs-β, are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form of C. chinensisby affecting cuticle contents and thickness. To study the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism, we identified a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor and named it as Bursicon receptorCcBurs-R ( GenBank: OR488626 )

. chinensis by low temperature and CcTRPM. Then, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor CcBurs-R to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, miR-6012 targets CcBurs-R to modulate the function of the Bursicon signaling pathway in this seasonal polyphenism

. These findings suggest that bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development ( Costa et al., 2016 ). These researches indicate that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. Although the reactions involved in cuticle tanning are well-known, further studies are needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis

. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of CcBurs-R knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, these findings strongly support our hypothesis that Bursicon and its receptor are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Actually, seasonal polyphenism is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple cascade reactions

. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Furthermore, we identified CcBurs-R as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form

. Finally, through in vivo and in vitro assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets CcBurs-R and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis, but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism.

., 2020 ). In C. chinensis, cuticle pigment absorbance and cuticle thickness, both have an increasing trend over time under 10 °C conditions, and showed very high correlation with the nymph phenotype of cuticle tanning during the transition from summer-form to winter-form ( Zhang et al., 2023; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). To clarify the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in the seasonal polyphenism of C

. As a result, the first instar nymphs of summer-form develop into third instar nymphs of winter-form to better adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on: ( 1 ) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis, ( 2 ) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches.

. The results showed that the mRNA levels of CcTre1 and CcCHS1 were obviously decreased in dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, or dsCcBurs-R feeding nymphs on the sixth day compared to the control ( Figure 4I–J ) This data indicates that CcBurs-R functions up-stream of the chitin biosynthesis pathway and is involved in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. To determine if miRNAs are involved in the regulation of the Bursicon hormone in the seasonal polyphenism of C

. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In animals, miRNAs are essential for tissue development and behavioral evolution ( Lucas and Raikhel, 2013 ). Previous studies have reported that many miRNAs function upstream of the neurohormone signaling pathway in insect polyphenism ( Suderman et al., 2006 )

. Therefore, these findings indicate that CcBurs-R is the Bursicon receptor of C. chinensis and is regulated by a low temperature of 10 °C and CcTRPM. The function of CcBurs-R in seasonal polyphenism was further investigated using RNAi technology. qRT-PCR results revealed that RNAi efficiency was 66–82% after dsCcBurs-R feeding for 3, 6, and 10 days compared to the dsEGFP treatments ( Figure 4A ). As shown in Figure 4B–F, the total pigment extraction at a wavelength of 300 nm ( 0

. chinensis samples were selected for analysis. Temporal expression patterns showed that CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β have very similar gradually increasing expression trends and higher expression in winter-form than summer-form ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D ), indicating that Bursicon may play a significant role in winter-form. This result is consistent with the report on gypsy moths, where transcript levels of Ldbursicon in adult stages were higher than in larvae ( Zhang et al., 2022b )

. Therefore, our results suggest that CcBurs-R mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by directly affecting cuticle contents and thickness. Since CcTre1 and CcCHS1, two rate-limiting enzyme genes in the chitin biosynthesis pathway, have been demonstrated to be involved down-stream in this transition of C. chinensis, we next investigated the relationship between Bursicon signal and these two genes

. chinensis by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). Up to now, no insect hormones or neuropeptides underling this seasonal polyphen have been identified. Our results indicate that Bicon and its receptor play a pivotal role in the transition from summer to winter in C. chinensis by regulating the chitin biosynthesis pathway.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.

   ., 2022 ). In summary, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG tumors. HDAC inhibition, in combination with the novel MYC inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduced tumor growth in vivo. Our findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy.

., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Furth et al., 2022 ), underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer. Indeed, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and to restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas ( Grasso et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2007; Su et al., 2022 )

. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 ( methylation and acetylation ) and lysine 4 ( methylation ) on histone H3 ( Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Furth et al., 2022; Harutyunyan et al., 2019 )

., 2018 ). High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas ( Buczkowicz et al., 2014; Mackay et al., 2017 ). H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling ( Krug et al., 2019; Pajovic et al., 2020; Dubois et al., 2022 )

., 2013; D’Artista et al., 2016 ). The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and to block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma ( Dubiella et al., 2021 ). To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, we tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcome

. We show that the combined treatment substantially reduces viability of patient-derived glioma cells, in concordance with the inhibition of prominent oncogenic pathways, including the mTOR pathway. Treatment of H3-K27M DMG xenograft mice models with this drug combination led to reduced tumor growth and confirmed downregulation of mTOR in vivo. Together, these results suggest the combination of PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy for H3-K27M gliomas.

Treatment dosages of these drugs were set according to previous studies ( Mohammad et al., 2017; Grasso et al

., 2021 ). While PIN1 is not overexpressed in DMG tumors, we show that Sulfopin, although not inhibiting MYC directly, downregulates MYC target genes in patient-derived DMG cells and affects cell survival in an H3-K27M-dependent manner. These results are in line with the contribution of MYC signaling to H3-K27M-driven tumorigenesis ( Pajovic et al., 2020; Dubois et al., 2022 ), underscoring the therapeutic potential of Sulfopin for these aggressive brain tumors

., 2021 ). Indeed, RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analysis of H3-K27M-mutant patient-derived glioma cells ( SU-DIPG13 ) treated with Sulfopin revealed strong enrichment of MYC targets among the downregulated genes ( Figure 1A ). The genes downregulated by Sulfopin were also enriched for MYC-bound genes identified in several non-glioma cell lines, supporting a role for PIN1 in activation of the MYC pathway also in these glioma cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B )

., 2015; Yin et al., 2007; Su et al., 2022 ). However, recent studies demonstrated that H3-K27M cells develop resistance to HDACi treatment ( Grasso et al., 2015; Su et al., 2022 ), stressing the importance of identifying novel drug combinations to induce synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways. The MYC oncogenic pathway is frequently deregulated in diverse cancers, and thus stands as a prominent therapeutic target ( Chen et al., 2018 )

., 2017; Harpaz et al., 2022 ). Detailed characterization of the modes of chromatin deregulation in these tumors pointed toward targeting epigenetic pathways as a promising therapeutic approach ( Filbin and Monje, 2019 ). Specifically, pervasive H3K27 acetylation patterns observed in H3-K27M DMGs, along with enrichment of H3K27ac specifically on mutant nucleosomes ( Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Furth et al

., 2012; Wu et al., 2012 ). Among these global epigenetic alterations are a drastic loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation ( H3K27me3 ), concomitant with an increase in H3 lysine 27 acetylation ( H3K27ac ). These epigenetic alterations were shown to affect transcriptional programs and support tumorigenesis ( Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Harpaz et al., 2022 )

. In H3-K27M-mutant DMGs, as well as in many other malignancies, high MYC activity is correlated with poor prognosis and therefore considered as an attractive therapeutic target ( Buczkowicz et al., 2014; Oster et al., 2002 ). Nevertheless, direct targeting of MYC is highly challenging, functional, and structural wise. MYC signaling, while amplified in cancer cells, is also essential to normal cell function ( Pelengaris et al., 2002 )

. We next examined epigenetic features that may underlie the inhibition of oncogenic pathways by the combined treatment ( keeping the same experimental setup as shown in Figure 2A ). Inhibition of HDACs is expected to increase and alter genome-wide histone acetylation patterns, including the H3K27ac mark associated with active promoters and enhancers ( Minucci and Pelicci, 2006 )

., 2017 ). H3-K27M cells were reported to be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition as they rely on the residual H3K27me3 levels to maintain gene silencing ( Bender et al,2013; Chan et al,201; Lewis et al,201; Krug et al,2019; Fur et al,202; Harun et al,2019 ). Inhibition of EZ2, a H3Kme3 methyltransferase, was shown to restore H3me3 in H-K27-mut glioma cells ( Fur et al,202 ). We hypothesized that combined inhibition of EZ2 and HDs would synergize in downregulation of oncogenic pathways in H-K27-mut glioma cells. Indeed, transcriptome and epigen profiling of H-K27-mut glioma cells treated with Vorin and Sop showed downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways, including the mTOR pathway ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in treated with the drug combination ( Figure 4 ). These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN and HD inhibitors as a promising approach for aggressive H-K27-mut gliomas

Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the biomedical research article:

**Title:** Targeting Epigenetic and Transcriptional Pathways in H3K27-Mutant Diffuse Midline Gliomas

**Background:** Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are resistant to current treatments. Lysine methionine substitution residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-KM) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of cells to promote tumorigenesis. H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway.

**Objective:** In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HDs) and MY in these tumors.

**Methods:** Treatment of H-K27 patient-derived cells with Sop, an inhibitor of MY-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigen profiling revealed synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR.

**Results:** In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with the combination.

**Conclusion:** These results highlight combined with PIN and HD inhibitors as a promising approach for aggressive tumors.

**Key Findings:**

* H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation epetic pathways affecting postlational modifications lysine 27 methylation and acylation and lysine 4 methylation on histone H.
* High gene amplification of MY is recurrent in pediatric-grade gliomas.
* H-K gliomas show high expression MY and MY target genes due both epetic and structural, resulting in viability on MY signaling.
* PIN inhibitor Sop was shown to downregulate MY target in vitro and block MY-driven in murine neuroblastoma.
* Combined treatment of HD and MY activation using Vor and Sop yielded beneficial outcome in H-K glioma cells.
* Transcript and epigen profiling showed synergistic effect in downulation of oncogenic pathways, including mTOR.
* In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenraft showed significant growth in treated combination.

**Discussion:**

* H-K gliomas develop resistance to HD treatment, highlighting the need for novel combinations to induce synergistic inhibition oncogenic pathways.
* MY oncogenic is deregulated in diverse cancers, making it a prominent target.
* Epetic pathways are a promising approach for H-K gliomas, given pervasive H acylation patterns and enrichment on mutant nucleosomes.
* MY activity correlates with poor prognosis, making it an attractive target.
 Direct targeting MY is challenging, but epetic alterations may underlie inhibition

    Title: 
    Abstract: The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and a viral encephalitis. While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated P. leucopus, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease.

   . leucopus and M. musculus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) in the blood, spleen, and liver ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ). In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an ‘alternatively activated’ or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected ‘classically activated’ or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for M. musculus ( Murray et al., 2014 )

. musculus. Indeed, ‘leukocyte activation’ and ‘leukocyte migration’ were GO terms for down-regulated DEGs in M. musculus. Distinctive GO terms for up-regulated genes distinguishing mice from deermice were ‘response to virus’, ‘response to interferon-beta’, ‘response to interferon-gamma’, ‘response to protozoan’, and ‘type II interferon signaling’

. A comparatively restrained transcriptional response in deermice was also noted for Mx2. On the other hand, there were greater fold-changes from baseline in P. leucopus than in M. musculus for Mmp8, Slpi, S100a9, and Il1b, the gene for interleukin-1 beta. Supplementary file 1 lists all the selected targets with the means and confidence intervals for the normalized values for controls and LPS-treated M. musculus and controls and LPS-treated P. leucopus ( Source data 1 )

How does the white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for ( Barbour, 2017 )? The diverse tickborne pathogens ( and diseases ) for humans include the extracellular bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ), the intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( anaplasmosis ), the protozoan Babesia microti ( babesiosis ), and the Powassan flavivirus ( viral encephalitis )

. leucopus and LPS-treated M. musculus had similar slopes, but the y-intercept was shifted upwards towards a higher ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes for blood from the LPS group of deermice. Control group mice and deermice and LPS-treated mice had similar percentages ( ~5% ) of monocytes in their blood; the mean monocyte percentage rose to 10% in LPS treated deermice ( p=0. 12 ). Eosinophil percentages tended to be higher in deermice at a mean 3. 4 ( 2. 1–4. 7 ) % than mice at 1

. Most deermice remain persistently infected but display scant inflammation in affected tissues ( Cook and Barbour, 2015; Long et al., 2019; Moody et al., 1994 ), and without apparent consequence for fitness ( Schwanz et al., 2011; Voordouw et al., 2015 ). A related question—conceivably with the same answer—is what accounts for the two-to-three fold longer life span for P. leucopus than for the house mouse, Mus musculus ( Labinskyy et al

. For the LPS-treated animals ( right panel Figure 6 ) there was, as expected for this selected set, higher expression of the majority genes and greater heterogeneity among P. leucopus and M. musculus animals in their responses for represented genes. In contrast to the findings with controls, Ifng and Nos2 had higher transcription in treated mice. In deermice the magnitude of difference in the transcription between controls and LPS-treated was less

. There was little or no detectable transcription of Ifng in the blood of deermice in which Il1b expression was high. There was also scant to no transcription of Ifng in the blood of P. leucopus 12 hr after injection of LPS ( Table 3 ). The up-regulation of the interferon-gamma gene within 4 hr of exposure to LPS was not limited to the species M. musculus. In an experiment with the rat R

. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries ( Xiao et al., 2011 ). We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, P. leucopus and M

. musculus. The up-regulated gene profile for P. leucopus featured terms associated with ‘neutrophil degranulation’, ‘myeloid leukocyte activation’, ‘leukocyte migration’, and ‘response to molecule of bacterial origin’. Other sets of up-regulated genes for the deermice were ‘negative regulation of cytokine production’ and ‘regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process’. None of these were among the top 20 up-regulated clusters for M. musculus

. leucopus data and M. musculus data revealed that untreated controls had coherent profiles within each species ( Figure 2 ). With the exception of one mouse, the LPS-treated M. musculus were also in a tight PCA cluster. In contrast, the LPS-treated deermice displayed a diversity of genome-wide transcription profiles and limited clustering. For both species, the number of genes with higher expression with LPS exposure exceeded those with lower or unchanged expression. For P

. Controls had a mean 4. 9 ( 3. 5–6. 4 ) x 103 white cells per µl among M. musculus and 5. 8 ( 4. 2–7. 4 ) x 103 white cells per µl among P. leucopus ( p=0. 41 ). For the LPS-treated animals the values were 2. 1 ( 1. 5–2. 7 ) x 103 for mice and 3. 1 ( 0. 9–5. 4 ) x 103 for deermice ( p=0. 39 ). However, there was difference between species among LPS-treated animals in the proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the white cell population

. This was not associated with a fall in the absolute numbers or percentages of monocytes in the blood of these animals ( Table 1 ). Taken together, the Nos2/Arg1, Il12/Il10, Akt1/Akt2, and Cd14/Fcgr3 relationships document a disposition toward alternatively activated macrophages and nonclassical monocytes in P. leucopus both before and after exposure to LPS. This contrasts with profiles consistent with a predominance of classically activated macrophages and classical monocytes in mice

. musculus ( Murray et al., 2014 ). The deermice also differed from mice in displaying evidence of greater neutrophil activation and degranulation after LPS exposure. The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in P. leucopus by proteins like secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, encoded by Slpi, and superoxide dismutase 2, encoded by Sod2

. This suggests that studies of other mammals, including humans, need not administer LPS or other TLR agonist to assess disposition toward M1 or M2-type polarization. This reading could serve as a prognostic indicator of the inflammatory response to infection with B. burgdorferi or other pathogen and the long-term outcome. The second difference we highlight is the activation of ERV transcription that was prominent in the LPS-treated mice and rats but not in similarly-treated deermice

The ratios of neutrophils to lymphocytes were 0. 25 ( 0. 14–.36 ) for mice and 0. 5 ( 0 0.–.8 ) for deice ( p= 0 0. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    Title: 
    Abstract: Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

In this study, we found that different from human GSDME, a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb

It has long been observed that although human caspase ( HsCASP ) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME ( HsGSDME ) ( at the site of DMPD ) ( Poreba et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017 ). The underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we found that a pufferfish T

Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, which leads to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7. In conclusion, we identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis

. Mutation of the cleavage site ( D255R and D258A ) inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage ( Figure 2L and M, Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C ). These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Since it is known that human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7, the observation that TrGSDME was cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7 intrigued us to explore the underlying mechanism

. In contrast, this Asn residue was changed to Ser in the CASP7 of mammals, especially primates, resulting in divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 in substrate recognition and cleavage. Since, unlike non-mammalian vertebrates, mammals possess multiple pyroptotic GSDM members ( GSDMA, B, C, D, and E ), the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules

., 2022 ). The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that, unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions, fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death. Regulation by different CASPs may represent a mechanism that enables fish GSDME to execute the orders of different pyroptotic signals

. SWR and GSWF are known to be responsible for CASP substrate binding ( Chai et al., 2001; Riedl et al., 2001 ). However, in our study, we found that these two motifs are conserved in human and pufferfish CASP7, and they had no apparent effect on the substrate discrimination of HsCASP7. By contrast, the chimeric HsCASP7 containing the p10 subunit of TrCASP7 acquired the ability to cleave HsGSDME, indicating an important role of p10

. In zebrafish, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 to generate the pyroptotic NT fragment ( Wang et al., 2017 ). In turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ), GSDMEa is bi-directionally regulated by CASP3/7, which activate GSDMEa, and CASP6, which inactivates GSDMEa ( Xu et al., 2022 ). In common carp ( Cyprinus carpio haematopterus ), GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 and induces pyroptosis ( Zhao et al., 2022 )

GSDME is an ancient member of the GSDM family existing ubiquitously in vertebrate from teleost to mammals ( Broz et al., 2020; De Schutter et al., 2021 ). In humans, GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, but it is not cleaved by CASP7, which recognizes the same DxxD motif. CASP3 cleavage releases the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment from the association of the inhibitory CT fragment and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyroptosis ( Rogers et al

. The GSDME-CT domain and the CASP7 p10 subunit are critical in the determination of CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. Within the p10 subunit, a single residue plays a key role in CASP7 substrate recognition and cleavage. Our results reveal the molecular basis of the functional divergence of CASP7 and CASP3, and suggest separate evolutions of CASP7 and GSDME in mammals. These findings add new insights into CASP-regulated GSDME activation in lower and higher vertebrates.

. Comparative study on the functions of GSDMEa and GSDMEb is scarce, and it remains to be explored whether clear physiological roles are played by these two orthologs in fish. As executors of pyroptosis, teleost GSDMEs are activated via different mechanisms. In tongue sole ( Cynoglossus semilaevis ), GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis ( Jiang et al

. Indeed, the D255R and D258A mutants of TrGSDME were resistant to TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3/7 cleavage ( Figure 1I and J, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TrGSDME was cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 in a manner that depended on the specific sequence of DAVD ( Figure 1K ). We next examined whether TrGSDME, like HsGSDME, is a functional pyroptosis inducer

. In this study, we found that a pufferfish T. rubripes GSDME ( designated TrGSDME ), which belongs to the GSDMEa lineage of teleost GSDME ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3 and 7 ( Figure 1A and B ). This intriguing observation promoted us to explore the mechanism of HsCASP7 substrate discrimination. We first examined whether TrGSDME could be cleaved by pufferfish CASP ( TrCASP ) 3/7

. With the exception of primates, the conserved Asn is present in a large number of mammals, including mice. Mouse CASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME, further supporting the importance of the Asn in CASP7 recognition and cleavage. The inability of mouse CASP7 to cleave mouse GSDME is consistent with a previous report that CASP7 deletion had little effect on mouse GSDME-mediated pyroptosis ( Sarhan et al., 2018 )

. For CASP3, a highly conserved Asn residue ( corresponding to HsCASP7 S234 ) was found in non-mammalian vertebrate CAS3, but not in mammalian CAS3 ( Figure 1— supplement 1 ). This Asn is critical for CAS7 substrate recognition and cleavage, as shown by the inability of CAS3 to cleave GME with the As mutated to Ser ( Figure 1 and Figure 1— supplement B ). CAS3 cleavage of GME releases the pyropt-inducing NT from the association with the inhibitory CT and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyptosis ( Rogers et al.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study, with participants blinded to their treatment condition. 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine ( initial bolus 0. 23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0. 58 mg/kg/hr ). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. We found that: ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ( ii ) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. This study was supported by NIH grants DP5OD012109-01 ( A.

    Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) ( Krystal et al., 2019 ). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD ( Murrough et al., 2013; Hack et al., 2021 ). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects ( e

., 2015; Abdallah et al., 2017; Abdallah et al., 2018 ). However, this finding failed to replicate in patients with depression 48 hr post-ketamine ( Kraus et al., 2020 ), suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine’s acute and delayed effects. In addition to GBC, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum ( Joules et al., 2015 )

., 2021 ). A limited number of studies have also characterised ketamine’s neural systems-level functional alterations using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating that ketamine results in robust brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity ( GBC ) in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) in healthy controls specifically, and normalize the reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hr post-ketamine ( Anticevic et al

. We hypothesize that ketamine will result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to ketamine. We further hypothesize that using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach to capture ketamine’s acute effects will allow us to more closely relate ketamine’s effects to its hypothesized molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps

. In addition, we investigate the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by directly comparing ketamine to two other psychoactive substances that have also shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression, but have very different pharmacological profiles: ( i ) psilocybin, a preferential 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A agonist; and ( ii ) LSD, which stimulates a wide range of serotonin and dopamine receptors ( Gasser et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris et al

. g. NMDA receptor occupancy ) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms ( Murrough et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2008 ). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects

. Furthermore, neural measures were only collected during ketamine’s peak effects. Given ketamine’s antidepressant effects are shown to peak 24–72 hr post-infusion, future studies may wish to collect additional follow-up scans ( Krystal et al., 2019; Berman et al., 2000 ). While behavioral measures were collected during both peak effects and offset, the use of repetitive questionnaires and tasks introduces potential psychometric confounds such as familiarity and practice effects

. We address this knowledge gap by: ( i ) showing there is robust inter-individual variability in both the behavioral and neural response to ketamine that requires a multi-dimensional analytic approach; and ( ii ) providing a multi-dimensional framework with which to connect across ketamine’s behavioral, neural and molecular effects that is resolvable at the single subject level

. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine. Ketamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients ( i. e

. Finally, it will be important for future studies to assess the importance of intra-individual variation in addition to inter-individual variation. A key goal in psychiatric research is to predict treatment response. One of the main barriers to the development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response to ketamine is our limited understanding of inter-individual variability in ketamine response

., 2015 ). Meanwhile, a nodal predictive model found ketamine resulted in reduced connectivity within the primary cortices and the executive network, but increased connectivity between the executive network and the rest of brain ( Abdallah et al., 2021 ). Finally, dynamic resting-state functional connectivity showed that ketamine decreased connectivity both within the left visual network and inter-hemispherically between the visual networks ( Spies et al., 2019 )

. Thus, this framework enables us to take an individual’s behavioral response to ketamine, and then meaningfully infer where that individual falls in relation to their ketamine-induced neural effects. Given this framework operates at the whole-brain level, this indicates that the neural effect of ketamine is not ROI-based but a distributed system-wide effect

. Overall, this indicates that the behavioral effects of acute ketamine administration are also multi-dimensional. In order to relate ketamine’s behavioral and neural effects, we mapped the data-reduced ketamine-induced changes in behavior ( i. e. behavioral PC1 and PC2 ) to the neural data ( Ji et al., 2020 )

. We compared the acute effect of ketamine to two drugs that also have anti-depressive effects, psilocybin and LSD, by: ( i ) calculating Δ GBC parcellated neural maps for each participant; and ( ii ) computing effective dimensionality for each substance using the Δ GBC maps as input ( see Materials and methods ). Ketamine resulted in significantly higher dimensionality compared to LSD and psilocybin, while there was no difference between LSD and psilocybin ( Figure 2C )

. 42; Figure 5—figure supplement 6B, Figure 5—figure supplement 8C ). To explore whether the lower-dimensional behavioral axes of variation can lead to inferences about ketamine’s neural effects, we: ( i ) compared inter-individual variability in behavioral PC1 and neuro-behavioral PC1; ( ii ) explored whether neuro-behavioral PC1 captures inter-individual variability in how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms may relate to its neural and behavioral effects

. Instead, we use the established relationship between ketamine and SST/PVALB interneurons to evaluate the relative merits of assessing ketamine’s acute effects using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach. The current study aims to investigate the behavioral and neural effects of acute ketamine administration in 40 healthy controls using a whole-brain data-driven multi-dimensional ( PCA ) approach

 Our results show that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting interindividual variability in response to ketamine. We also found that ketamine’s data-driven neural gradient matched SST and PVAL cortical expression in humans, while the mean did not. Furthermore, behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine which were resolvable at the single-subject level.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life, primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. Autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed. Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence, thereby maintaining diversity. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ), while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes.

   . The present study aims to remedy these deficiencies by quantifying the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth modeled as stochastic dynamics. We represent the replicator sequences individually, and copying error as well as energetic constraints in strand separation are also considered explicitly

. Using a constant population model version of this framework, we first investigate how the diversity-maintaining mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators. We further demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world

. Finally, in order to validate that Darwinian selection by competitive exclusion is also feasible in this framework, we consider a chemostat model of parabolic replication, in which monomer building block resources are additionally taken into account. Using this approach, we demonstrate that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from the coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest.

. The demonstrated diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators ( e. g. Babajanyan et al., 2023 ). It is, however, noteworthy that besides the ‘information first’ view of the RNA world hypothesis, there are other concepts as to how life arose; e. g., the ‘metabolism first’ or autotrophic origins view ( Wächtershäuser, 1988; Joyce, 2002; Martin et al

., 1990; von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 ). Thus, replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and therefore promote coexistence. Indeed, parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Varga and Szathmáry, 1997 )

. To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of parabolic dynamics in a competitive setting, the master replicator types are characterized by different replicabilities. This assumption reflects the fact that, at least in case of RNA, the rate of copying of short templates by polymerization of activated monomers inherently varies with template composition ( Szostak, 2012 )

. Furthermore, we consider the essential requisite that ensures parabolic dynamics, namely that the growth rate of the population is proportional to the square root of the actual size of the population. Our analytical results show that in this simple model ‒ except for Q=0, where Q denotes the probability of the error-free replication of a master sequence ‒ there is no error threshold: the master type will persist at any level of mutation rate ( Figure 5, right panel )

. Strand separation rates of these duplexes are relatively low compared to strand association ( e. g. von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 ). Therefore, replication cycles are strongly inhibited and as a result, the population dynamics displays parabolic characteristics. We define a set of replicators with the highest fitness relative to all mutant genotypes and refer to them as ‘master’ types ( Eigen, 1971 ), representing the genetic information to be maintained

As we have demonstrated, template-directed, non-enzymatic replication of oligomer modules leading to parabolic growth profiles is an effective genetic information maintaining mechanism which may thus have constituted an indispensable bridge from the very first abiotic synthetic pathways for RNA to a ribozyme-dominated stage of the RNA world

. In order for our stochastic simulation results to be comparable with the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics, we analytically calculate the equilibrium master ( i. e. fittest sequence ) concentrations as a function of the copying fidelity and the reproductive superiority of the master sequences relative to the mutants. We also compare the error threshold in case of parabolic dynamics to the case of the exponential dynamics

., 2017; Strazewski, 2019 ). Therefore, a major current focus in models of parabolic replication is how to incorporate Darwinian selection into its dynamics ( Lifson and Lifson, 1999; Scheuring and Szathmáry, 2001; von Kiedrowski and Szathmáry, 2001 ). While the latter models considerably improved the parabolic replication model framework in terms of its potential to incorporate evolvability, they did not account for the copying error threshold of their respective systems; i. e

. Such studies may help gain a deeper insight into the question whether the emergence of an effective strand separation mechanism, or other conditions implying kinetic constants that shift the dynamics toward exponential amplification, allowed for a still sub-exponential diversity-maintaining mechanism during later phases of chemical evolution and thus a gradual evolutionary transition from non-enzymatic replication to ribozyme-aided amplification

As a reference case, we analyzed the behavior of a simplified dynamics of parabolic replication ( Equation 15A and Equation 15B in Appendix 1 ). For analytic tractability, we assume infinite population size and a single peak replication landscape in which a single genotype has high replication rate, all others have the same baseline value, the ratio of these two values ( denoted by A ) is the reproductive superiority

. The two key components of evolutionary algorithms are exploration and exploitation ( Bäck et al., 2000 ). If diversity decreases too fast under selection, this can lead to premature convergence, resulting in a population getting stuck at a local adaptive peak. In order to avoid premature convergence, various diversity-maintaining mechanisms have been introduced. We call attention to the fact that parabolic growth is an organic form of diversity maintenance

. e. cooperative coexistence, see, for example, Epstein, 1979; Mizuuchi and Ichihashi, 2018 ) can considerably broaden the parameter space in which we reported competitive coexistence of different replicator variants. In this study we considered kinetic constants that correspond to the p≈0. 5 growth order. Further investigations into the 0

. For instance, parabolic growth dynamics, a kinetic behavior observed in non-enzymatic self-replicating systems ( von Kiedrowski, 1986 ), has been proposed as an ideal candidate mechanism to sustain a large amount of prebiotic genetic information ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Scheuring and Szathmáry, 2001 ). In this kinetics, the growth order p is equal or close to 0. 5 ( i. e

. However, molecular evolution of the Darwinian type is thought to necessitate exponential, rather than parabolic amplification, because in the latter case robust coexistence of the competing replicator species generally limits the efficiency of natural selection ( Sievers and von Kiedrowski, 1998; Szilágyi et al., 2017; Strazewski, 2019 )

. In order to make our model framework to be more suitable for focusing on different aspects of parabolic dynamics, we considered two different model versions of parabolic replication ( Figure 1A and B ). To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of the system, we generate a T-membered set of master sequences. The ϕi replicability of master sequence type i is: ( 8 ) ϕi=ϕmin+ ( i−1 ) ⋅δ where i=1, 2, …, T

., 2016 ). If enzyme-free replication of oligomers with a high degree of sequence variability was indeed attainable from prebiotic chemistry, then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information ( Szostak, 2011 ) could be preserved under competition among distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities ( e. g. replicabilities ) ( Eigen, 1971; Szathmáry, 1991; Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995; Jiménez et al

., 2011 ). Moreover, practically no model of parabolic replication has been able to account for the error threshold of the system ( Lifson and Lif,199; Scheuring and Szathry,2001; voniedki and Szathry,2001 ). In this study, we demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for template-directed, enzyme-free replication thereby proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax the error in information storage of the RNA world hypothesis

The study aims to remedy these deficiencies by quantifying the information-maint potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like replicators displaying parabolic modeled as stochastic dynamics. We represent the replicator sequences, copying as well as energetic constraints in strand separation explicitly. Using a constant population version of this framework, we investigate how diversity-maint mechanisms operate in parabolic in a population of replicators. We demonstrate that par coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for template-directed enzyme-free replication thereby proposing a simple mechanism to relax the error in information systems of the RNA world. Finally, to validate Darwinian selection by competitive is feasible in this framework, we consider a chemostat model of parabolic in which monomer block resources are taken into account. Using this, we show that increased competition mediated by a decrease in resource rate can induce a switch from co ensured par dynamics to survival of the fittest

The diversity-maint mechanism of par populations can be used as a plug model to investigate coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular ( e. g. Babany et al,202 ) It is noteworthy that besides the information view of RNA hypothesis there are other concepts to life arose e. g. metabolism first or autrophic origins ( Wächhäuser,198; Joyce,200; Martin et al,199; Kiedki et al,199 ) Replicating in populations displaying par growth are prone to inhibition by duplex formation a feature can efficiently dampen competition and promote co. Parabolic growth can sustain unlimited number competing species in infinite size ( Szmá and Gladh,198; Varga Szmá,199 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Moreover, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2, 2G-modified tRNAs. In addition, we provide evidence that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. These studies uncover TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications.

., 2021 ). The putative interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could affect the function of TRMT1 with consequent effects on tRNA modification levels. However, the association between Nsp5 and TRMT1 has not been validated nor characterized. Here, we find that TRMT1 is an endogenous cleavage target of Nsp5 resulting in methyltransferase inactive cleavage products

. Examination of the primary structure of human TRMT1 revealed an eight amino acid residue sequence between the methyltransferase domain and zinc-finger motif matching the consensus sequence of Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins ( Figure 2A and B ). The putative cleavage site in TRMT1 includes a glutamine ( Q ) residue conserved at the fourth position that is found in all Nsp5 cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins ( Figure 2B )

. In contrast to wild-type TRMT1, the appearance of the N- or C-terminal TRMT1 cleavage fragments was barely detectable when the TRMT1-Q530N mutant was co-expressed with Nsp5 ( Figure 4C, lane 8, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ). Altogether, these results demonstrate that TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by Nsp5 in human cells with cleavage requiring a sequence that matches Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins

., 2020b ). Interestingly, the same study found no detectable interaction between TRMT1 and Nsp5 encoded by MERS-CoV, which has 66. 8% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. TRMT1 was also identified as a potential interactor with catalytic-inactive Nsp5 using proximity-dependent biotinylation ( Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2020 ). TRMT1 is a tRNA modification enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dimethylguanosine ( m2, 2G ) at position 26 in more than half of all human tRNAs ( Dewe et al

. Purification of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins from human cells have identified a potential interaction between a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 with human TRMT1 ( Gordon et al., 2020a ). A cross-coronavirus investigation from the same group has extended this observation by finding that TRMT1 interacts with a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 encoded by SARS-CoV-1, which is 98. 7% similar to SARS-CoV-2 ( Gordon et al., 2020b )

. Notably, the level of TRMT1 was not appreciably changed in the TRMT1-KO cell line expressing TRMT1-Q530N after infection with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 7A, lanes 4–6; quantified in 7 C ). These results provide evidence that the decrease in endogenous TRMT1 levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to cleavage of TRMT1 by Nsp5. We next measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels after infecting the TRMT1-KO cell lines with SARS-CoV-2

Our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 might self-limit its replication by altering the host translation machinery through TRMT1 degradation and reduced levels of m2, 2G-modified tRNAs. This perturbation of the tRNA pool may further inhibit host translation that is already targeted by Nsp1 blockade of mRNA entry on 40 S ribosomes ( Kamitani et al., 2009; Lapointe et al., 2021; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020 )

. These results suggest that TRMT1 in the cytoplasm is the likely target of Nsp5 cleavage with the cleavage fragments displaying altered localization compared to full-length TRMT1. We next investigated whether TRMT1 expression impacts SARS-CoV-2 replication by infecting the 293T control-wild-type ( WT ) or TRMT1-KO human cell lines described above with SARS-CoV-2

. Notably, the TRMT1-KO cell line expressing TRMT1-Q530N exhibited a higher level of viral RNA production compared to the TRMT1-KO cell line expressing TRMT1-WT at higher MOI ( Figure 7, KO +Q530 N ). Altogether, these results uncover a requirement for TRMT1 expression for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Since the presence or absence of TRMT1 appears to impact SARS-CoV-2 RNA production in human 293T cells, we tested if this phenomenon could alter viral particle production

., 2022 ). The observation that expression of the non-cleavable TRMT1-Q530N variant enhances viral replication and infectivity supports the hypothesis that TRMT1 could facilitate tRNA uptake into viral particles. The packaging of specific tRNAs in viral particles could augment viral translation in the subsequent round of infection, thereby enhancing infectivity and perhaps facilitating the species jump of SARS-CoV-2 towards hosts with incompatible codon bias.

. As expected, titration of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles at either low or high MOI led to a concomitant increase in viral RNA in both control and TRMT1-KO cell lines ( Figure 6E and F ). Notably, TRMT1-KO cells exhibited a ~three to fourfold reduction in viral RNA compared to control cells infected at the same MOI ( Figure 6E and F ). These results suggest that expression of TRMT1 is necessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells

. In multiple independent replicates, MRC-5 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a ~30% reduction in TRMT1 levels at 24- and 48 hr post-infection compared to mock-infected cells ( Figure 1B ). These results provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces cellular levels of TRMT1. We next measured the levels of TRMT1-catalyzed m2, 2G modifications in cellular RNA using quantitative mass spectrometry

. The RNA modifications that decrease upon viral infection include modifications that are known to be present in multiple types of RNA, including tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human MRC-5 lung fibroblast cells alters the steady-state levels of multiple RNA modifications, including the m2, 2G modification catalyzed by TRMT1

. Altogether, these observations suggest an unexpected role for TRMT1 expression in virus production and the generation of optimally infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles.

. Based upon a predicted tertiary structure of TRMT1 using Alpha Fold ( Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022 ), this putative Nsp5 cleavage site is expected to lie in an unstructured linker region exposed on the surface of TRMT1 ( Figure 2C ). To investigate a potential interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1, we used human 293T cells due to their high transfection efficiency. We transfected human 293T cells with plasmids expressing wild-type ( WT ) TR1 or the TR1-QN mutant and HA-tagged N5 ( Figure 3, lanes 1–3 ) and 4 ) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA ( Figure 3, lanes 1–3 and 4 ) We detected TR1 and N5 co-precipitation using anti-TR1 ( Figure 3, lanes 1–3 and 4 ) and anti-HA ( Figure 3, lanes 1–3 and 4 ) respectively. The interaction between TR1 and N5 was not observed in cells transfected with TR1-QN and N5 ( Figure 3, lanes 5 and 6 ). These results indicate that TR1 is an endogenous cleavage target of N5 in human cells and that cleavage requires a sequence matching N5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens; rather, they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens.

   . Here, yeast populations were artificially selected for adherence ability in one context, in order to determine whether it led to an increase in virulence in another. Specifically, yeast were evolved to adhere to a plastic bead ( Poltak and Cooper, 2011 ), then tested against wax moth larvae to estimate virulence. In replicate populations of two genetic backgrounds, the yeast increased in their ability to express multicellularity in numerous forms

. To test the coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis, we sought to determine if the evolved changes had an effect on virulence, and were particularly interested in the unexpected evolution of hyper-multicellular clones. Virulence was measured using larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, an invertebrate model used to study microbial pathogenesis and virulence ( Pereira et al., 2018 ), including in S. cerevisiae ( Phadke et al., 2018 )

., 2019; Friman et al., 2011; Mikonranta et al., 2012; Hosseinidoust et al., 2013] ). In the research presented here, rather than altering the biotic or abiotic environment and determining the effect on virulence, we apply direct selection to a specific trait hypothesized to be dual-use in the biomedical model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aside from serving as a model for genetics and cell biology, and being found in a myriad of ecological niches around the globe ( Peter et al

. Thus, the evolutionary changes brought about by selection for adherence to a plastic bead, led to the incidental evolution of increased virulence.

Our results demonstrate that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits— a common feature of organismal evolution ( Price and Langen, 1992 ) — but here, the correlated traits may have included those associated with virulence. In this experiment, favoring the ability to adhere to plastic, a surface that is common in industrial, medical, and domestic settings ( Geyer et al., 2017 ), led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence

. In our experiment, it is unclear which trait was associated with increased virulence: plastic adherence, a different multicellular trait, or general hyper-multicellularity. Regardless of the specific trait causing increased virulence, the experiment demonstrated that selection for a dual-use trait in an environment that is entirely devoid of host organisms can still inadvertently lead to virulence and pathogenicity

. Not all multicellular phenotypes responded in the same way, with pseudohyphal growth appearing to evolve independently from plastic adherence, biofilm formation, and flor formation. This phenotypic evolution demonstrates the complexity of the interacting genetic networks underlying yeast multicellularity. Along with these correlated effects of selection, the yeast also became more virulent

. The coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis proposes that selection for survival in harsh conditions may lead to traits that predispose microbes to virulence. However, harsh environmental conditions can also favor traits that favor the collective, or multicellular phenotypes ( Tong et al., 2022 ), so it is perhaps not surprising that other forms of multicellularity increased throughout this experiment. Furthermore, in its long evolutionary history, S

. The experiment also demonstrated the role that sex can have in increasing rates of adaptation in fungi. Whether or not increased virulence caused by adherence selection is a general result in fungal microbes remains to be seen. In bacteria, the results are mixed. In Burkholderia cenocepacia, plastic bead selection led to an increase in biofilm phenotypes and mutations previously associated with chronic infections ( Poltak and Cooper, 2011; Traverse et al., 2013 )

. The function of microbial traits in both the open environment and the host is crucial evidence for the coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis. However, experimental evolution allows the idea to be tested directly; thus far, most evolution experiments have focused on co-culturing opportunistic microbes with predators ( e. g., [Leong et al., 2022; Friman and Buckling, 2014; Fu et al., 2021; Steenbergen et al., 2003; Albuquerque et al., 2019; Friman et al

. cerevisiae ( McCusker et al., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018; Palecek et al., 2002 ), although biofilm formation has been linked to pathogenicity in other fungi ( Fanning and Mitchell, 2012 ). Not all strains are capable of expressing these phenotypes. And while some strains express multiple multicellular traits ( Casalone et al., 2005; Zara et al., 2009 ), there does not appear to be a correlation among the numerous adherence phenotypes ( Hope and Dunham, 2014 )

. Our results experimentally demonstrate that selection on dual-use traits outside of a host environment can inadvertently favor pre-adaptations for virulence.

., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018 ). Some environmentally derived strains are capable of adhering to surfaces and expressing associated aggregative phenotypes ( Verstrepen and Klis, 2006 ). These range from biofilms on solid and semi-solid agar, to pseudohyphal growth and agar invasion, to floating mats on liquid surfaces ( flors ). Of these multicellular phenotypes, only invasive and pseudohyphal growth have been linked to pathogenicity in S. cerevisiae ( McCusker et al

The study of infectious disease often focuses on pathogenic microbes that either specialize in exploiting animal hosts or act as commensals that switch to pathogenesis when the delicate balance between host and microbe is perturbed. These microbes are presumed to have co-evolved complex adaptations that allow survival and reproduction in and on hosts. However, there exists a broad range of microbial organisms that live in the open environment ( i. e

. A hypothesis similar to coincidental selection, known as ‘accidental virulence’, has been proposed ( Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007 ) and explored in parallel in the eukaryotic microbial literature, also with a focus on the biotic environment ( reviewed in Siscar-Lewin et al., 2022; Casadevall et al., 2019 ). For example, in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, traits that protect from predatory amoeba also play a role in human infection ( Steenbergen et al

. In choosing the non-multicellular strains, clones were taken from a variety of time points, including the ancestor, control, and experimental populations at different time points. This allowed us to verify that it was the evolved hyper-multicellular phenotype and not just long-term growth in the evolution medium. Strains were grown in the medium in which they were evolved, then washed, adjusted for density, and injected into larvae

. aeruginosa ( Leong et al., 2022 ). In the same bacterial species, an evolution experiment with both protist and phage predators showed that phage could mitigate the decrease in virulence associated with protist predation ( Friman and Buckling, 2014 ). Despite the complexity, it is clear that selection from the biotic environment can strongly influence bacterial virulence

. The effect of the different types of genetic variants suggests that some strains and genetic backgrounds are more likely to evolve virulence from selection in the open environment. The strains used in this experiment each contain ~50, 000 heterozygous sites and differ from each other by ~25, 000 SNPs. It is possible that they contained genetic variation in canonical signaling pathways, allowing for the evolution of hyper-multicellular strains

. aeruginosa ( Friman et al., 2011 ). The dual-use virulence traits that can be under ‘coincidental selection’ and lead to ‘accidental virulence’ are numerous and range from toxin production, such as the production of gliotoxin in the soil-dwelling fungus Aspergillus flavus, to biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Researchers developed a coarse-grained model, Mp, to investigate the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) from six proteins: hnRNPA, TDP, F, US, ERS, RB14, and T1. The simulations revealed scaling laws that quantify the change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across the tested family, suggesting that scaling can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens. The study demonstrates that at least for hnPA, there are quantitative rules that explain changes in thermodynamic of condens in response to amino-acid mutations. The objective was to discern scaling laws that capture variations of PL critical parameters as function sequence. A systematic approach was employed varying amino sequence of PLDs to determine phase behavior changes with compositional perturbations. Three types of scaling laws were defined and tested, revealing that changes in critical temperatures of PL as function of number and type amino mutations can be quantified by scaling, conserved across PL investigated. The data was organized in a table illustrating effect of single mutations on critical temperatures of family PL as function of PL length. Consistent with evidence and predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues are dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL. A set of phase diagrams revealed conserved laws that quantitatively predict change in critical temperatures single-component PL solutions as function of number and type amino mutations. The simulations explored protein-rich and protein-depleted phases of cond for each mutant in temperature-concentration space, encompassing 140 mutants at 8-12 temperatures. Scaling laws serve to verify generality of grammar governing phase across PL proteins and quantify extent critical temperature change response amino sequence.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine.

    In this work, we aimed to establish an approach that allows leveraging a rich description of the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time to predict individual traits. We showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. It preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models

. This is an important consideration as it may affect studies with small sample sizes and with heterogeneous training and test sets ( e. g. where a researcher may want to fit a model to healthy controls and subsequently test it on patients ). We here aimed to show the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset as well as simulated data

. We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans, in this case acquired during wakeful rest, and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits. In particular, we use the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ), which is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity ( FC ) dynamics ( Vidaurre et al., 2017 )

., 2022; Smith et al., 2019 ). Despite this crucial role in interpreting model errors, reliability is not often considered in models predicting individual traits from neuroimaging features. In summary, we show that using the Fisher kernel approach, which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM, we can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably

. We compared the Fisher kernel to kernels which ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model ( ‘naïve’ kernels ), to a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ), and to methods based on time-averaged functional connectivity

. This is because these models are usually parametrised by a high number of parameters with complex mathematical relationships between the parameters that reflect the model assumptions. How to leverage these parameters for prediction is currently an open question. We here propose the Fisher kernel for predicting individual traits from brain dynamics, using information from generative models that do not assume any knowledge of task timings

Using the resting-state fMRI timeseries from the HCP dataset, we found that among the kernels constructed from HMMs, the linear Fisher kernel had the highest prediction accuracy on average across the range of behavioural variables and CV folds and iterations, as shown in Figure 2a. Compared to the other linear kernels ( which do not respect the geometry of the HMM parameters ), the linear Fisher kernel ( mean r κFl: 0

., 2017 ). HMMs have previously been shown to be able to predict certain complex subject traits, such as fluid intelligence, more accurately than structural or static ( time-averaged ) FC representations ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ). We combine the HMM with the Fisher kernel, which allows for the efficient use of the entire set of parameters from the generative model

. To estimate patterns of time-varying amplitude and FC, we here use the Hidden Markov Model ( Vidaurre et al., 2016; Vidaurre et al., 2017 ). However, the kernels, which are explained in detail in the following section, can be constructed from any generative probabilistic model

. While we here tested robustness in terms of susceptibility to changes in CV folds, it remains to be shown to what extent model performance is sensitive to the random initialisation of the HMM, which affects the parameter estimation ( Alonso and Vidaurre, 2023; Griffin et al., 2024 ). We also showed that the Fisher kernel is most sensitive to changes in state descriptions, that is individual differences in the amplitude or functional connectivity of certain brain states

. Our proposed approach provides one avenue of addressing this by leveraging individual patterns of time-varying amplitude and FC, as one of many possible descriptions of brain dynamics, and it can be flexibly modified or extended to include, for example information about temporally recurring frequency patterns ( Vidaurre et al., 2016 )

Observing a person’s behaviour over time is how we understand the individual’s personality, cognitive traits, or psychiatric condition. The same should apply at the brain level, where we may be able to gain crucial insights by observing the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time, that is brain dynamics. One way of describing brain dynamics are state-space models, which allow capturing recurring patterns of activity and functional connectivity ( FC ) across the whole brain

. We here showed that taking the structure of the underlying model or predictors into account, and thoroughly assessing not only accuracy but also errors and robustness, we can reliably use information from brain dynamics to predict individual traits. This will allow gaining crucial insights into cognition and behaviour from how brain function changes over time, beyond structural and static information.

. One reason why brain dynamics are not usually considered in this context pertains to their representation: They are represented using models of varying complexity that are estimated from modalities such as functional MRI or MEG. Although there exists a variety of methods for estimating time-varying or dynamic FC ( Lurie et al., 2020 ), like the commonly used sliding-window approach, there is currently no widely accepted way of using them for prediction problems

. The Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) is a generative probabilistic model, which assumes that an observed time-series, such as BOLD signal in a given parcellation, was generated by a sequence of ‘hidden states’ ( Baum and Eagon, 1967; Baum and Petrie, 1966 ). We here model the states as multivariate Gaussian distributions, defined both in terms of mean and covariance —which can be interpreted as distinct patterns of amplitude and FC ( Vidaurre et al., 2017 )

. The distributions of correlation coefficients for the different methods are shown in Figure 2a and the explained variance in Figure 2b. The performance of all methods is also summarised in Supplementary file 1b. We found that the linear Fisher kernel also predicted more accurately than other HMM-based kernels when fitting the HMM to only the first resting-state session of each subject, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2

. This means that predictions are driven more by what an individual’s states look like, rather than by how they transition between states. However, the Fisher kernel can be modified to recover differences in transition probabilities if these are relevant for specific traits. In the results above, we have constructed kernels from HMMs fit to all subjects in the dataset and only separated them into training and test set at the regression ( and deconfounding ) step

., 2009 ), where group-level components are regressed onto each subject’s fMRI data to obtain subject-specific versions of the parcels and their timecourses. We normalised the timecourses of each subject to ensure that the model of brain dynamics and, crucially, the kernels were not driven by ( averaged ) amplitude and variance differences between subjects. Subjects in the HCP study completed a range of demographic and behavioural questionnaires. Following Vidaurre et al

. We show that our approach significantly outperforms methods that do not take the mathematical structure of the model into account, as well as methods based on time-averaged FC that do not consider brain dynamics. For interpretation, we also investigate which aspects of the model drive the prediction accuracy, both in real data and in simulations

. While this could be a disadvantage if a trait was more closely related to how an individual transitions between brain states, we found that this was not the case in any of the traits we tested here. Other traits than the ones we tested here may of course be more related to individual transition patterns. For this case, we showed in simulations that the Fisher kernel can be modified to recognise changes in transitions if they are of interest for the specific research question

 Researchers have proposed a new approach to predict an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Current methods focus on structural aspects, such as brain connectivity or thickness, or aggregated activity over time, but neglect the dynamic patterns of brain activity over time. The new approach uses a Hidden Markov model (HMM) to describe functional and amplitude patterns and combines it with a Fisher kernel to predict traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed mathematically from the H, preserving the model’s structure. In fMRI data, the H-Fisher approach is accurate and reliable, outperforming other methods that ignore the model’s structure or use time-averaged connectivity. The approach leverages individual’s timevarying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction, with applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.

The study aimed to establish a method that captures brain dynamics to predict traits. The Hisher approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from neuroimaging data, preserving the model’s structure, ideal for generative and predictive models. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training sets. The study used the Hidden Markov Model, a probabilistic model of timevarying amplitude and functional dynamics. Despite its role in interpreting errors, reliability is not considered in predicting traits from neuroim features. The Fisher kernel preserves the H’s structure, predicting traits from brain dynamics accurately and reliably.

The study compared the Fisher to kernels that ignore the model’s structure and methods based on Kull-Leibler divergence and timeaver functional. These models are parametrized by complex relationships between parameters, open to leverage for prediction. The Fisher predicts traits from gener models that assume no knowledge of timings. Using resting-state fMRI from the Human Connectome dataset, the Fisher had highest accuracy across behavioural variables and folds. Compared to linear kernels that do not respect the H’s parameters, the Fisher had a mean correlation of 0.201. Hs have predicted complex traits, such as intelligence, more accurately than structural or timeaver representations. The Hisher combines the entire set of parameters from the generative model.

The study used the Hidden Mark Model to estimate timevary amplitude and functional. The kernels can be constructed from any generative probabilistic model. The Fisher is sensitive to changes in state, individual differences in amplitude or connectivity. The approach provides a way to leverage patterns of timevary amplitude, one of brain dynamics, and can be modified to include frequency patterns.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by effectively increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates, and we hypothesized that such a mechanism might explain LRRK2 activation observed in additional contexts beyond lysosomal damage. We next examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, also had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes

., 2020 ). Here, we used endogenous expression conditions to demonstrate that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G, which lies outside of LRRK2’s kinase domain, and the VPS35 D620N variant have been shown in previous studies and confirmed here to increase LRRK2 activity ( Liu et al., 2018; Mir et al

., 2018; Herbst et al., 2020 ). There is a clear need to better define how LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage, how these steps translate to LRRK2 activation, and how broadly conserved these mechanisms are in PD. Here, we identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity. Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage

Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is observed with pathogenic PD-linked variants and in sporadic PD patients, but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activation is regulated basally and in response to endolysosomal stress associated with disease. We identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activation and demonstrate that Rab12 plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage

. We demonstrate that Rab12 promotes Rab phosphorylation by recruiting LRRK2 to lysosomes following lysosomal membrane rupture. Pathogenic PD variants including VPS35 D620N and LRRK2 R1441G also result in increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes. Together, our data delineate a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease.

. Together, these results suggest that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to lysosomes upon damage and that this may be a conserved mechanism also employed to contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to PD-linked variants.

., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018 ). Our results suggest that these variants may also promote LRRK2 activation by increasing Rab12-mediated LRRK2 localization to lysosomes, implying this may represent a general mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased by various genetic variants and environmental stressors associated with PD

. Additional studies are warranted to determine how lysosomal membrane rupture triggers Rab12 recruitment, to identify other regulatory processes that may contribute to Rab phosphorylation upon lysosomal damage, and to better define how broadly such mechanisms are employed to drive LRRK2 activation in PD

. We cannot rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage, as the magnitude of change in Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes

. Rab10 phosphorylation was increased on lysosomes in response to LLOMe treatment while the levels of LRRK2 were not significantly impacted on lysosomes isolated from LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond LRRK2 localization may also contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage in these cells

. The levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes were significantly increased in untreated LRRK2 R1441G KI cells and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting that enhanced localization of LRRK2 to lysosomes and proximity to its Rab substrates may contribute to the elevated Rab10 phosphorylation observed on lysosomes at baseline in these cells ( Figure 4D )

., 2018; Gomez et al., 2019 ). However, additional work in RAB29 KO models demonstrated that LRRK2 activity was minimally impacted by loss of Rab29, suggesting Rab29 does not regulate LRRK2 activity under physiological conditions ( Kalogeropulou et al., 2020 ). To determine whether any LRRK2-Rab substrates were required for LRRK2 kinase activity, we performed a targeted siRNA screen on 14 Rab genes in human A549 cells that endogenously express both LRRK2 and Rab10

., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021 ). We next explored whether Rab12 might mediate LRRK2 activity in the context of either a pathogenic variant in LRRK2 ( R1441G ) or VPS35 ( D620N ). Rab10 phosphorylation was significantly reduced with RAB12 knockdown in LRRK2 R1441G KI and VPS35 D620N KI A549 cells ( Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

. As our work focused on the role of Rab12 in A549 cells, it will also be important to understand whether Rab12 similarly regulates LRRK2 activation and localization to damaged lysosomes in other cell types. Our findings provide key insight into the mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased in response to lysosomal damage by demonstrating that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to ruptured lysosomes

. A recent CRISPR-based genome-wide screen for modifiers of Rab10 phosphorylation also identified RAB12 as a top hit, providing additional validation that Rab12 is a key regulator of LRRK2 activation ( Dhekne et al., 2023 ). Our data show that lysosomal membrane rupture promotes Rab12 localization to lysosomes

., 2020 ). A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which LRRK2 responds to lysosomal damage and how these contribute to PD pathogenesis is critical in guiding new potential therapeutic strategies targeting LRRK2 for the treatment of PD.

. We propose a model in which Rab12 recruits LRRK2 to the lysosome and enhances its activity on lysosomal membranes by increasing LRRK2’s local concentration near Rab10 and potentially other Rab substrates ( Figure 4E ). Previous studies suggested that another LRRK2 substrate, Rab29, can regulate LRRK2’s kinase activity and showed that exogenously expressed Rab29 is capable of activating LRRK2 at the trans-Golgi or at additional membranes when artificially anchored there ( Purlyte et al

. Rab12 is itself a substrate for LRRK2, and we next explored whether LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab12 contributed to LRRK2 activation. To assess this, we generated doxycycline-inducible stable cell lines in the RAB12 KO cell background to allow overexpression of wildtype ( WT ) or a phospho-deficient mutant Rab12 in which the LRRK2 phosphorylation site ( S106 ) was converted to an alanine ( Figure 2D )

., 2018; Kluss et al., 2019 ). The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR ( Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc ) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2’s kinase activity ( Alessi and Sammler, 2018; Kalogeropulou et al., 2022 ). The LRR2 R144G and V35 D variants have been previously shown to increase LK activity ( Liu et al.,2018; Mir et al,2018; Herbst et.202 ),202 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.

In this report, we describe a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology in a fully automated manner. The complete experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5

. As a result, we were able to follow single cells and the manual annotation of cell cycle phases according to the color of the red and green merged images in Figure 1A, qualitatively confirmed the impact of CDK inhibitors. Furthermore, the expected difference in cell cycle progression of NB4 vs Kasumi-1 cells was evident. The original time-lapse images were composed by red and green channels, detecting respectively the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator

., 2019; Hiratsuka and Komatsu, 2019 ). Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) have been employed for this, effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 )

. The described work allows researchers in the field to analyze thousands of ( non- ) adherent cells per each experimental condition by using the image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing, cell tracking, filtering of incorrect tracks, and cell cycle phases identification and characterization.

. The presented image and data analysis workflows rely on two different software, Fiji and R, widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts were made publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator, but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge

. Consequently, targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy, especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation ( Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009; Khan and Wang, 2022 ). Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry, providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases ( Furia et al., 2013; Ligasová et al., 2023 )

. Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing, TrackMate-based cell tracking, and machine learning-based track filtering, thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow. In summary, we present a comprehensive, experimental protocol for cell cycle analysis in adherent and non-adherent cells ( summarized in Box 1 )

In the last few years, efforts have been made to simplify the cell cycle assessment relying on FUCCI technology, resulting in the development and public availability of software tools and ImageJ plugins ( Roccio et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2017; Ghannoum et al., 2021; Taïeb et al., 2022 ). However, all these methods require human intervention at different points in the analysis workflow, such as the initial selection of cells for analysis ( Taïeb et al

. During the experiment, each cell alternatively switches between the expression of these two markers as it goes through the different cell cycle phases, causing the lack of a single fluorescence channel suitable for tracking. Furthermore, the automatic profiling of cell cycle phases becomes cumbersome when dealing with two distinct channels that in the end give rise to two independent fluorescence time series

., 2021 ). Such technology should hypothetically enable us to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended imaging durations. To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis, we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines, exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization

. Moreover, the set-up pipeline makes possible the quantification of potentially thousands of cells in an automated fashion relying on the crucial contribution of a machine learning algorithm. Various approaches have been documented for imaging non-adherent cells. These range from creating custom supports to confine cell movement within a restricted region enabling extended imaging periods of up to 40 hr ( Day et al

., 2023; Rieger, 2022 ). Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells, thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population ( Chao et al., 2019; Hiratsuka and Komatsu, 2019 )

. The G1 to S transition was once captured as predominantly red ( mCherry > mVenus, Figure 4D ), once as yellow ( mCherry ≈ mVenus, Figure 4D ), and once as green ( mVenus > mCherry; Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ). We were able to accurately quantify the cell cycle progression of NB4 and Kasumi-1 cell lines over 72 hr at single-cell resolution and, as represented in Figure 3A and B, cell cycle differences of NB4 and Kasumi-1 cells were quantified

. Two different AML cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, were equipped with the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology and chosen as the study models. NB4 cells have relatively faster doubling time in comparison to Kasumi-1 cells ( Skopek et al., 2023 ). Hence, NB4 cells were treated with vehicle or CDK inhibitors, being compared to the naturally slow-cycling counterparts, Kasumi-1 cells, by time-lapse imaging ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

. It was applied to the analysis of the cell cycle phases of two different AML cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have different durations. Hence, detecting this difference was a reliable initial verification strategy for the protocol’s efficiency. As a second quality check step, we decided to treat the relatively fast-cycling NB4 cells with suboptimal concentrations of three different CDK inhibitors ( palbociclib, PF-06873600, and ribociclib )

. To evaluate the relative expression of the two fluorescent probes during this transition, we conducted flow cytometry and confocal experiments on Kasumi-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 probes. In these experiments, the S phase was labeled by a pulse of EdU and the DNA by DAPI or Hoechst 33342 ( Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Figure 4A shows cell cycle profiling based on EdU vs

. On the tracks classified as trackable, a manual threshold on the hue intensity is employed to determine the cell cycle phases ( G1, S, and G2/M ). Furthermore, to quantify the cell cycle at the single-cell level, track splitting to isolate individual cell components and perform phase assignment into G1, G1/S, S, and G2/M is performed using a custom R function. The resulting single-cell tracks enabled the quantification of individual phase durations for each cell

. Our live-cell imaging of the relatively fast-cycling NB4 cells in the presence of these drugs at such spectrum of concentrations affirmed the significant G1-prolongation in these cells ( Figure 3B and Videos 2–4 ). The total average duration of one full cell cycle was quantified as 21. 5 hr ± 6. 5 hr ( mean ± standard deviation ) for NB4 cells and 24. 0 hr ±7. 8 hr for Kasumi-1 cells

. DAPI can successfully discriminate G1, S, and G2/M phases, with the S phase being subdivided into early, mid, and late S phases ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). The proportion of cells in each phase is comparable to the cell cycle profiling of the same cells by FUCCI ( CA ) 2 ( Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B )

., 2009 ), to partially immobilizing cells using substances like gelatin ( Day et al.,202; Rger,202 ) or agarose ( et al.202 ) has been used to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended periods.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.

Our aim here was clearly not to provide an accurate identification of anatomical boundaries across brain regions in individual species, as others have done using finer neuro-anatomical methods in humans and macaques ( e. g

. Critically, the size of the FP and the corresponding development of metacognitive skills is not exclusively related to population density ( proxy for social interactions ) but also to daily traveled distance ( proxy for foraging complexity ). Thus, these data are also compatible with the ecological brain hypothesis ( Milton, 1981 )

. Thus, we could evaluate the strength of the relation between specific regions of the prefrontal cortex and specific socio-ecological variables across species, as observed in the wild, thereby complementing laboratory studies and bridging the gap between cognitive neurosciences, behavioral ecology, and primate evolution.

. e., working memory and planning, are critical for foraging in primates, especially when they need to travel long distances, and presumably have to deal with more complex navigation strategies. This is clearly in line with the global idea of the ecological brain hypothesis, but here we provide a critical insight into the specific neuro-cognitive operations associated with foraging strategies

. Further work would be needed to capture the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild, as well as their interactions. The size of the DLPFC, which we used as a proxy for working memory and planning skills, showed a significant relation with daily traveled distance ( proxy for foraging complexity ), and to a lesser extent with population density ( proxy for social complexity ). This suggests that the cognitive functions at play in the DLPFC, i. e

. Critically, both of these theories are based on the assumption that the whole brain volume is a good proxy for overall cognitive abilities, and that these global abilities can benefit social interactions or foraging, across species in an evolutionary framework. But clearly, the level of precision of such neuro-cognitive scenario remains limited, given the precision with which neuroscience and psychology have characterized the brain functional anatomy and cognition, respectively

. To address this question, we measured the volume of the two prefrontal regions of interest ( FP and DLPFC ) in 16 primate species and evaluated the influence of key socio-ecological factors on the size of these regions

., 2013 ). Critically, again, social and ecological functions are tightly intermingled in primates’ natural environment and more specific studies would be needed to clarify how DLPFC-related functions such as working memory are involved in natural conditions, when animals need to face both ecological and social challenges. This new set of results can be integrated in the general framework of the primate mosaic brain evolution, i. e

. But the contribution of the FP to metacognition and of the DLPFC to working memory is so strong and reliable in humans and laboratory primates that it seems reasonable to assume that, given the relative level of conservation of prefrontal cortex anatomical organization across primates, FP and DLPFC should also play a key role in metacognition and working memory in other primate species

. Here, we restricted our analysis to a set of specific brain regions, namely the FP and the DLPFC, assuming that the difference in size of these brain regions across species could readily be used as proxies for the relative importance of their corresponding functions ( namely, metacognition for the FP and working memory for the DLPFC ). Using that tool, we explored the relation between neuro-cognitive entities ( e. g

. Altogether, these procedures provide a reliable indication of the specificity of the influence of socio-ecological variables on the FP and DLPFC volumes, used as proxies for inter-species differences in metacognitive and working memory skills, respectively. used as proxies for inter-species differences in metacognitive and working memory skills

. The underlying assumption that we used was that the functional anatomy of the prefrontal cortex was enough conserved in primates, such that traits that were common between humans and macaques were also shared with other primates ( Amiez et al., 2019; Bludau et al., 2014; Sallet et al., 2013 ). Of course, the neural mechanisms underlying metacognition and working memory are extremely complicated and they involve myriads of other brain regions ( e. g

. g. working memory ), which allow to organize behavior over space and time to reach a goal, and rely upon several regions of the prefrontal cortex ( Fuster, 2008; Luria, 1973 ). Given the complexity encountered in natural environments, it is hazardous to extrapolate these findings in artificial laboratory conditions to the decision-making processes ( in both social and ecological dimensions ) occurring in wild primates, for which the diversity of social interactions ( e. g

., 2017 ). For example, group hunting, which involves both social and foraging functions, only occurs in a few primate species where metacognition is thought to be particularly developed ( Boesch, 1994; Conard et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021; Schaik, 2016 ). Concerning the DLPFC, given its very clear implication in working memory and planning, we speculated that it would be critically involved in foraging

. But these relations between specific brain regions and socio-ecological variables across species provide little insight into the cognitive processes that could be at play, because they do not necessarily map onto specific neuro-cognitive processes identified in rigorous laboratory conditions

. Conversely, integrating realistic socio-ecological challenges can provide a strong insight into the evolution of specific brain functions in primates. Of course, we would need to provide a clearer model regarding how facing socio-ecological challenges can rely upon specific and dynamic cognitive operations, but we believe that this is a critical first step that helps building a common theoretical framework to cross boundaries across behavioral ecology and cognitive neurosciences.

. e., the different distinct structures varying in size both within and between species, and reflecting selection for cognitive skills. In line with recently published papers ( DeCasien et al., 2022; Smaers et al., 2021; van Schaik et al., 2021 ), we argue that the relation between ecology, neurobiology, and cognition can be better captured with more specific brain measures, and more specific cognitive operations, than by using the cruder measure of brain size

., 2021; Shultz and Dunbar, 2022 ). Thus, our work indicates that the notions of ‘social brain’ and ‘ecological brain’ should not be mutually exclusive, even when considering specific brain regions. Rather, we confirm intuitions based on laboratory studies that the FP, through its role in metacognition, belongs to both sets of brain regions defined as the social brain and the ecological brain, respectively

. In conclusion, our results confirm that the size of specific brain regions can be related to socio-ecological variables through the cognitive operations relying on these regions in laboratory conditions. Thus, our approach which aims at articulating cognitive operations reported in laboratory settings with real socio-ecological challenges should provide a clear insight into the neuro-cognitive operations at play in the wild, as well as their evolution in primates

. To evaluate the relevance of laboratory-based neuro-cognitive concepts for understanding which cognitive operations could be mobilized to overcome specific socio-ecological challenges in the wild and their variability across species, we addressed the following central question: to what extent does the functional mapping between brain regions and specific executive functions in laboratory conditions relate to variability in socio-ecological variables at the interspecific level

    Title: 
    Abstract: An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known. Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID] ). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Hence, just like myofibril CSA, the automated measurements of the number of myofibrils per fiber with FIM-ID were indistinguishable from the manually obtained EM-based measurements. Having validated the accuracy of the FIM-ID measurements, we then set out to determine whether the radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in fiber CSA ) that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis

. 9589, p=0. 0002 ) was observed when the automated measurements of myofibril CSA from each ROI were compared with the mean of the manual measurements. Thus, the results from these studies established that our automated program could accurately measure the size of myofibrils as identified with FIM-ID. EM has been extensively used to assess the ultrastructural characteristics of skeletal muscle and numerous EM-based studies have reported measurements of myofibril size ( Wang et al

In this study, we developed FIM-ID as a means for visualizing myofibrils with a fluorescence microscope. As illustrated throughout the study, the images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines that can perform automated measurements of myofibril size and myofibril number

., 2023 ). As such, we are confident that a broad range of investigators will be able to take advantage of our method. With the development of our method, we were able to gain insight into whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis. This is a fundamentally important question in the field of skeletal muscle growth and therefore we addressed it with two model systems

. To further address whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis, we examined vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from humans that were collected before ( Pre ) and after ( Post ) they had performed 7 weeks of progressive RE ( Figure 6A )

. Having established the conditions for FIM-ID, we next sought to determine whether the images from FIM-ID would be amenable to automated measurements of myofibril size. To accomplish this, we first developed an automated pipeline in CellProfiler that could distinguish the periphery of the myofibrils ( i. e. the SERCA signal ) from the background within a single muscle fiber, and then all objects that were >90% enclosed by the signal from SERCA were identified ( Figure 3A–C )

. With this method in hand, we then set out to answer the fundamentally important question of whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis.

. Thus, by applying our optimized fixation, cryoprotection, and sectioning conditions, along with widefield fluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution, we fulfilled our goal of developing a time- and cost-effective method for visualizing intact myofibrils with a high degree of resolution and contrast, and we refer to the collective method as fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution ( FIM-ID ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

. The latter point is particularly important because it serves as a barrier to the development of programs that can perform automated measurements of features such as myofibril CSA and myofibril number. Thus, with EM, such measurements would need to be manually derived. To gain insight into the effort that manual measurements of myofibril CSA would require, we collected pilot data from EM images of mouse skeletal muscles

. These points, when coupled with the other data presented in Figures 5 and 6, indicate that radial growth of the muscle fibers was largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Importantly, this conclusion was upheld in two very distinct models of increased mechanical loading ( i. e. chronic MOV in mice and progressive RE in humans ). Thus, it appears that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is a conserved component of the radial growth response

As explained in the Introduction, one of the primary goals of this study was to develop a time- and cost-effective method for visualizing myofibrils with a level of resolution and contrast that would support automated measurements of myofibril size. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the fact that myofibrils are largely surrounded by an SR that is highly enriched with an enzyme called the sarco ( endo ) plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase ( SERCA ) ( Jorgensen et al

. Thus, to further address the role of myofibril hypertrophy, future studies should obtain data from muscles that are going through various stages of the radial growth response ( i. e. a time course )

., 2019; Jorgenson et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020 ). Indeed, a number of seemingly simple and fundamental important questions have not been answered. For instance, during radial growth, the cross-sectional area ( CSA ) of the muscle fiber increases, but whether this is mediated by an increase in the CSA of the individual myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) has not been resolved ( Jorgenson et al

. e. the myofibrils would not present as objects that were >90% enclosed by the signal for SERCA ). Thus, to address this, the automated measurements were performed on images in which the signal for autofluorescence and SERCA had been merged. With this approach, a more comprehensive decoration of the periphery of the myofibrils was obtained, and therefore, all of the remaining automated measurements on mouse skeletal muscle were conducted on merged images

. The sections were viewed at 80 kV on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope equipped with AMT BioSprint12 digital camera. For each muscle processed for EM, 20 Ox and 20 non-Ox fibers were randomly selected for imaging. For each fiber, one low-magnification image ( ×1250 ) and one randomly chosen high-magnification region ( ×5600 ) within the fiber were captured

. In our opinion, the concepts of myofibril splitting and de novo myofibrillogenesis are very intriguing, and we consider both models to be worthy of further investigation. In summary, the outcomes of this study have revealed that the induction of myofibrillogenesis plays a major role in the mechanically induced growth of skeletal muscle

., 1993; Ashmore and Summers, 1981; Goldspink, 1970; Penman, 1969 ). Hence, to further test the validity of our method, we directly compared our automated FIM-ID measurements of myofibril CSA with manual EM-based measurements. Specifically, we performed an experiment with four mice in which one plantaris muscle from each mouse was subjected to FIM-ID, and the other was processed for EM-based imaging

. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that an increase in mechanical loading can induce myofibrillogenesis. Moreover, the results of this study indicate that myofibrillogenesis is the major driver of the radial growth response. Given these conclusions, one is faced with the question of how an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis

. The mechanisms via which an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis are not known, but the groundwork for two different models has already been established. Studies aimed at testing the validity of these models should lead to important advancements in the field, and with the advent of FIM-ID, such studies can now be performed in a time- and cost-effective manner.

., 1975; Roberts et al., 2023 ). For instance, it is not known whether myofil splitting and de novo myofillogenesis occur simultaneously or sequentially, or if one is a prerequisite for the other. Further, it is not known whether myofil splitting and de novoofilogenesis occur in the same or different myofils.

    Title: 
    Abstract: SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size, due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current, mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO. These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. 

    Supporting Text:
   . The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations, in addition to the impaired Syt1 interaction. The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed. The RRP is often assessed by applying a pulse of hypertonic solution to the neurons, usually 0. 5 M sucrose ( Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996; Schotten et al., 2015 )

. Missense mutation in the SNARE bundle ( I67N ) leads to an increased amplitude of the energy barrier for fusion. In addition, disease mutations display inefficient rescue of neuronal survival. Overall, SNAP25 encephalopathy caused by single missense point mutations presents with interdependent functional deficits, which must be overcome for successful treatment.

. We confirmed the increase in spontaneous release rate and decrease in evoked release by V48F and D166Y reported previously ( Alten et al., 2021 ). Through in vitro analysis we find that both mutations lower Syt1 association to SNARE-protein liposomes

. These findings have consequences for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. It further demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single-point mutations.

. Indeed, part of the role of Syt1:SNARE interaction might be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming, which will affect both rates ( Walter et al., 2013 ). This might happen because transient binding to Syt1 might structure SNAP25 and assist in formation of the SNARE complex, whereas SNAP25 mutants might prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for Syt1

. Additional experiments both in vitro and in cells demonstrate that V48F and especially D166Y represent partial gain-of-function mutations that increase association to partner SNAREs and lower the energy barrier for fusion, bypassing Syt1-dependent control. Thus, these mutants do not phenocopy the loss of Syt1, but combine loss of Syt1 binding with a gain-of-function phenotype. At the same time, the mutants act as loss-of-function in upstream reactions, through effects on priming

., 2021 ). This is expected because the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex is required for both types of release ( Weber et al., 2010 ). Alten et al., 2021 described striking phenotypes for most SNAP25 mutations tested, but the molecular reason for these phenotypes remains incompletely understood, and a few findings were surprising. For instance, Alten et al. reported that the V48F and D166Y mutants supported an unchanged readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of vesicles

., 2017 ). Upon arrival of an action potential, Ca2+ binds to the two C2 domains of Syt1, which results in rapid vesicle–plasma membrane fusion and release of neurotransmitter within a fraction of a millisecond ( Südhof, 2013 ). The strong functional integration and specialization of the neuronal SNARE for speed have rendered the release machinery exquisitely susceptible to insults

., 2019; Mohrmann et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2012 ), folding kinetics correlates better to spontaneous fusion rates than overall SNARE complex stability. The D166Y and V48F mutations lead to increases in spontaneous release, and more asynchronous eEPSCs, consistent with their localization in the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface ( Schupp et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2017 ), and the demonstrated impaired Syt1 binding ( Figure 8B, C ), see also Alten et al., 2021

. 0629, one-sample t-test ). These data show that loss of Syt1 interaction upon mutation in the primary interface can be accompanied by a gain-of-function phenotype stimulating interactions with the other SNARE partners. This association of SNAP25 to the other SNAREs might happen as one of the last steps toward fusion; consequently, when D166Y and V48F join the complex prematurely, it will bypass layers of control and result in uncontrolled fusion

. 5, but not in the RRPev. SNAP25 disease missense mutations change the function of the protein without compromising its expression, leading to dominant negative or neomorphic mutations. Missense mutations in the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface ( V48F and D166Y ) result in a complex phenotype characterized by loss-of-function in the priming step and gain-of-function in the fusion step

. g. the I67N/4K mutation ). By inference, assembly of the primary Syt1:SNARE interface ( Zhou et al., 2017 ) is most likely involved in both clamping release and setting up an RRP. In further support of this, the minimal in vitro assay with preassembled t-SNARE dimers displayed a qualitatively similar reduction in calcium-dependent release, with D166Y being more impaired than V48F ( Figure 8D )

. Thus, the in vitro assay reproduces both the increased spontaneous release and the reduced Ca2+-dependent release found in neurons, indicating that these features are present within the minimal set of fusion proteins included in this assay ( i. e. the SNAREs, Syt1 and complexin ). There is evidence that SNAP25 might enter the SNARE complex last, after syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 are joined by Munc18-1 ( Baker et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2018; Sitarska et al

., 2020 ). In SNAP25, disease-causing mutations are found within the SNARE domains ( Hamdan et al., 2017; Klöckner et al., 2021; Rohena et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014 ). Alten et al., 2021 studied a selection of SNAP25 mutants, and found no changes in expression levels, but changes in both spontaneous and evoked release. Specifically, mutations in the primary Syt1:SNARE interface ( Zhou et al

. Another open question is whether the phenotype of the mutants in the primary interface ( V48F and D166Y ) is explainable solely by the loss of Syt1 binding, or whether other features of these mutations add to, or detract from, the phenotype. Here, we reexamined three SNAP25 disease mutations using glutamatergic autaptic neurons: I67N, V48F, and D166Y

. Overall, these data demonstrate a rather complex phenotype of the D166Y and V48F mutations, which combine a lowering of the energy barrier – a gain-of-function feature – with a loss of vesicle priming – a loss-of-function feature

., 2016 ), which agrees with the suggestion that Syt1 binds to the SNAREs before Ca2+ arrival ( Zhou et al., 2015 ). Conversely, Alten et al. reported a smaller RRP for the I67N mutant, but the I67 residue is present in the internal of layer +4, which we expected to affect final SNARE complex zippering causing membrane fusion rather than priming ( Sørensen et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2010 ). These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that Alten et al

. Overall, the energetic contribution of Syt1:SNARE interaction to Ca2+-triggered release is a matter of debate, with some arguing that it lowers the energy of the transition state ( Walter et al. 2013 ) and others that it stabilizes the SN complex ( Schotten et al. 2015 ). Our data suggest that the Sy1:SN interaction lowers the energy of the transition state for fusion, which is in line with Walter et al. 201. This is consistent with the idea that Sy1 binds to the SNs before Ca+ arrival ( Zhou et al 2015 ) and assists in the formation of the SN complex ( Walter et al 201 ).
Researchers analyzed data from thousands of researchers across 30 countries and found a correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality evaluations and funding rates. This applies to both men and women, and is robust to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures. The study builds on previous findings that women's work is valued less, regardless of who performs the work. The analysis used independent datasets and looked at research success rates and holistic quality scores, accounting for researcher characteristics like age, institution, and publishing patterns. Researchers in male-dominated disciplines have higher success rates and quality scores than female-dominated disciplines. This applies to both men and women. The study did not find that research in female-dominated disciplines is of lower quality, but suggests consistently evaluating female disciplines as lower than male disciplines. This affects everyone in those disciplines, but more women. 

The study analyzed a subset of data from a university and found differences in publication rates between minority and majority in a discipline continue, but the point remains that women in majority have lower scores. More men work in male disciplines than women. Research evaluation and funding are not perfect measures of quality, but balance of discipline is related to quality and success. The study did not establish causality or combine findings, but sought explanations in others' work. Findings do not show that in a male subject like physics, a woman's score is the same as a man's. Similarly, an Australian woman has higher funding than a man in the same discipline. This points to men and women having similar quality after accounting for discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female disciplines have fewer outputs on average. 

The study points to research suggesting male disciplines require 'briance, while female require 'hard'. Discipline perceptions could spill into evaluations and funding, producing a gender-based bias similar to findings. This could be due to cultural norms or women having fewer outputs or being attracted to disciplines with lower norms. Funding datasets, quotas, or pre-allocation of funds could explain some findings. The drop associated with moving from male to female discipline is larger for women than men. The gap within discipline is larger in female-dominated than male, though has closed between 2008 and 201. The study explored gender patterns in publication explaining variation across disciplines. Research is a contributor to lower success of African/Black scientists. Women publish less, receive citations, and have lower h-indices than men. Many observed women's research is evaluated lower than men's. Funding rates are lower for women than men in terms of number and size of grants. When including gender bias, the picture is less clear that a man and woman with same outputs, the minority likely has higher score. The study does not show women do lower quality research than men. Across disciplines, women have lower scores than men, more in female-dominated. This is suggestive of bias but not conclusive due to many factors.

    Title: 
    Abstract: One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.

   . Finally, we explore whether P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits.

. Finally, molecular sensors can be used to control cellular function as components of synthetic biological circuits. Outputting molecular sensors to genome editing events may facilitate the design of such control structures, particularly as the range of cellular activities that can be programmed by genome editing is rapidly expanding. In P3 editing, molecular interactions are sensed and converted directly into a genome editing output. Here, we demonstrated that specific RNA-RNA ( e. g

., 2022 ). Here, we present a strategy named ‘P3 editing’ ( protein-protein proximity ), in which specific protein-protein interactions or proximity events promote the formation of the active CRISPR-gRNA complex. P3 editing is based on the dual-component gRNA of the native CRISPR-Cas9 system ( Jinek et al., 2012 ), but with the crRNA:tracrRNA dimerization domain replaced with two protein-binding RNA aptamers such as MS2 and BoxB hairpins

. Furthermore, our design mimics the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system, initially discovered as the dual-RNA-guided system ( Jinek et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we pursued this strategy in further developing a molecular proximity sensor that drives genome editing

. Prime editing ( Anzalone et al., 2019 ) extends this advantage via a prime editing guide RNA ( pegRNA ) that programs both the target locus and editing outcome. However, to fully realize CRISPR’s potential in synthetic molecular circuits, we also require machinery that transduces molecular events into genome editing events. For example, the ENGRAM method transduces the output of transcriptional reporters into signal-specific prime editing events ( Chen et al., 2024 )

. In both prime editing and base editing demonstrations of the P3 strategy, we used the presence of LambdaN-MCP fusion protein to control the genome editing efficiency, forming a synthetic circuit with the input of protein expression and the output of genome editing. Recently, a similar synthetic circuit was developed using ADAR-based RNA editing, where the input of specific target RNA expression can be used to control an output of cargo protein expression

. Interactions or proximity between two different proteins tagged with MCP ( binding MS2 RNA aptamer ) and LambdaN ( binding BoxB RNA aptamer ) domains promote the formation of functional gRNA to induce genome editing. We demonstrate that P3 editing can be used in concert with both base editing and prime editing, converting known protein-protein interactions into genome editing events in human cells

. To convert protein-protein interaction events into genome editing events, we reasoned that the RNA dimerization domain within crRNA and tracrRNA could be replaced with an RNA-based protein dimerization domain, such that specific protein-protein interactions or prolonged proximity would aid in the formation of active gRNA that would then bind to Cas9 ( Figure 2a )

. Using such protein-sensing elements, one can imagine constructing synthetic circuits that sense protein-based signals to conditionally trigger genome editing of a specific genomic location, possibly in the form of a signal-specific editing outcome. The edit could be used to change the function of a specific gene via insertion/deletion/substitution, to modulate its expression via CRISPRa/i, or to record a memory of the signal into the genome via a ‘DNA Typewriter Tape’ ( Choi et al

. g. antibodies ). In particular, the CRISPR system for immune response in bacteria has been repurposed as a programmable genome editing method ( Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2012; Mali et al., 2013 ). Since its initial use for genome editing via a programmable nuclease, various genome and epigenome editing methods have been developed that leverage the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an integral component. Modifications of the Cas9 protein have facilitated more precise genome editing ( e

., 2019 ), CAMERA ( Tang and Liu, 2018 ), and ENGRAM ( Chen et al., 2024 ), which are limited to recording signal-driven transcription of the gRNA and/or the genome editor. Finally, the sensor elements in the P3 editing strategy are focused on engineering each CRISPR-gRNA while leaving the gene editor ( i. e. prime editor and base editor ) unaltered, potentially facilitating multiplex genome editing within the same cell

. g. base editing, prime editing ) or epigenetic control of gene expression ( e. g. CRISPRa, CRIPSRi ) ( Gilbert et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2013 ). A critical feature of CRISPR-based genome editing is its straightforward programmability, as the CRISPR guide RNA ( gRNA ) molecule alone can specifically program the genomic location to be edited. Prime editing ( Anzalone et al

. To test whether crRNA and petracrRNA modified with protein-binding aptamer sequences can be used to drive genome editing, we constructed a single protein where the MCP and LambdaN domains were fused with a flexible linker ( MCP-LambdaN ), with the intent of bringing crRNA-MS2 and BoxB-petracrRNA into close proximity to form active pegRNA. When we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing MCP-LambdaN, PE4max ( Chen et al

. When the MCP-LambdaN-expression plasmid was substituted with a GFP-expressing filler plasmid ( ‘Filler GFP plasmid’ condition in Figure 2b ), editing efficiency dropped to 6% of the eCTT control, indicating that crRNA-MS2 and BoxB-petracrRNA can promote genome editing to a limited extent, presumably by forming an active pegRNA complex even without the additional dimerization domain. We next sought to extend this approach to link arbitrary protein-protein interactions to genome editing

For example, various synthetic circuits have been built to modulate gene expression or post-translational modifications, in response to a wide range of input signals such as the presence of specific small molecules ( Chen and Elowitz, 2021 ). Genome editing is a potentially attractive output for synthetic molecular circuits

. Overall, these results suggest that while the P3 editing strategy can be combined with other synthetic circuits to control genome editing with various inputs, the efficiency and specificity of control may degrade over combinations of multiple synthetic modules, and that further optimization is necessary.

. Assuming the genome editing complex formation is reversible, improving P3 editing efficiency may be able to capture different strengths of protein-protein interactions, although some interactions may be too transient to promote functional gRNA formation. Finally, the current P3 editing design uses a pair of RNA aptamers and their corresponding protein binders, limiting the multiplex detection of protein-protein pairs. More orthogonal protein-RNA pairs need to be identified e. g

. In the past 30 years, several chemicals have been identified as critical signaling molecules for promoting protein-protein interactions ( Schreiber, 2021 ). We reasoned that the addition of such chemicals to cell culture could be used to control genome editing of specific targets and editing outcomes. To demonstrate the chemical control of P3 editing, we chose rapamycin-induced dimerization of FKBP and FRB protein domains of the mTOR pathway ( Banaszynski et al., 2005; Bierer et al

The article discusses the development of a new strategy called "P editing" that enables the use of protein-protein interactions to control genome editing in living cells. This is a significant advancement in the field of synthetic biology, as it allows for the design of molecular circuits that can process information in a predictable manner, like electronic circuits, but within living cells. Genome editing is a powerful tool for modulating gene expression or recording information to DNA, but programming events such as protein-protein interactions or proximity triggers for genome editing has been challenging. The authors demonstrate that P editing can link protein-protein to the formation of a functional CRIS-Cas9 dual guide RNA, by engineering the crRNA:acrRNA interaction. They show that various protein-protein interactions, as well as chemically induced dimerization of domains, can be used to activate editing or editing in human cells. Additionally, they explore how P can incorporate outputs from AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits within a circuit. This strategy enhances the controllability of CR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits in living cells.

The authors also explore whether P can be coupled to AD-based sensors to control editing based on expression, expanding the range of inputs that can drive specific editing in synthetic circuits. They demonstrate that molecular sensors can be used to control cellular components of synthetic circuits, outputting molecular to genome events, facilitating the design of such structures. The range of activities that can be programmed by genome is rapidly expanding, and P editing molecular interactions are converted directly into genome output.

To improve the efficiency and specificity of P, the authors engineered the crRNA-MS/Box-petrRNA design. They present a strategy called P, which uses protein-protein interactions to promote the formation of active CR-gRNA complex. This is based on the dual guide of the CR-Cas system, but with cr:acr dimer domain replaced with protein RNA aptamers such as MS and Box hairpins. The design mimics functional molecules within the CR-C system, discovered as dual-guided. They pursued this strategy to develop a molecular sensor that drives genome.

The authors demonstrate that P can be used with base and prime editing, converting protein-protein interactions into genome events in human cells. They convert protein-protein events into genome events by replacing the dimer domain with an RNA-based dimer domain, that specific-protein or prolonged aid the formation of activeRNA that binds to Cas. Using protein-sensing, synthetic circuits can be constructed that sense signals to conditionally trigger genome of specific location, in form signal-specific outcome. This can be used to change gene function via insertion/deletion, modulate via CRa, or record signal into genome via 'Tape'.

The CR system has been repurposed as programmable editing in bacteria, and various genome methods have been developed that leverage as an integral. Modifications have facilitated precise editing, such as CAMERA and EN, which record signal-driven transcription of and genome. The elements in P strategy focus on engineering CR-g while leaving editor un, facilitating multiplex within cell.

In summary, the article presents a new strategy that enables protein-protein to control genome in living, enhancing controll of CR-based editing, and facilitating use in synthetic circuits. It demonstrates that protein-protein interactions can be used to drive genome, and that can be combined with other circuits to control genome with various inputs. However, efficiency and specificity may degrade over combinations, and further optimization is necessary.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ), in particular omega 3, are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week ( Fernandez et al., 2021 ). PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric mechanism’ ( Elinder and Liin, 2017 ). According to this mechanism, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation ( ΔV0

The voltage-gated K+ channel KCNQ1, also referred to as Kv7. 1, is expressed in the heart. Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit, generating the so-called slow delayed-rectifier ( IKs ) current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential ( AP ) ( Barhanin et al., 1996; Sanguinetti et al., 1996; Nerbonne and Kass, 2005 )

., 1996; Nerbonne and Kass, 2005 ). Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) ( Splawski et al., 2000; Tester and Ackerman, 2014 ). These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current, leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval ( Nerbonne and Kass, 2005; Figure 1A )

., 2023; Larsen et al., 2011 ) in contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K+ channels, which are inactivated more in low K+ ( Larsson and Elinder, 2000; Kurata and Fedida, 2006 ). Our studies suggest that the mechanism of PUFAs to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance relies on the ability of PUFAs to favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter: PUFAs promote interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that stabilize the channel pore

. However, both approaches do not shorten the QT interval duration. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex ( Varshneya et al., 2018; Figure 1 ). Like other Kv channels, KCNQ1 has a typical tetrameric structure of four α-subunits

. 5 ) toward negative voltages and increase the maximum conductance of the channel ( ΔGmax ) ( Bohannon et al., 2019; Bohannon et al., 2020; Yazdi et al., 2021; Larsson et al., 2020; Wu and Larsson, 2020; Figure 1B and C ). The two PUFA effects ( ΔV0. 5 and ΔGmax ) on KCNQ1 are independent of each other and originate from the binding of PUFA to two different sites, conventionally indicated as Site I and Site II ( Yazdi et al., 2021; Liin et al., 2018 )

. S5C and S5D in Mandala and MacKinnon, 2023 ). Note also the currents from KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels display little external K+ dependence ( a small inhibition in addition to what is expected from changes in driving force ) and that KCNQ1 channels are more strongly inhibited by high extracellular K+ concentrations ( Abrahamyan et al., 2023; Larsen et al

. These channel mutations, or dysfunction, increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death ( Wu and Sanguinetti, 2016 ). At present, treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers ( most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol ) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope ( Roden, 2008 )

We have previously proposed models in which the effect of PUFAs on IKs channels involve the binding of PUFAs to two independent sites: one at the voltage sensor ( Site I ) and one at the pore domain ( Site II ). The result is a potent activation of IKs channels, with an increase in the maximum conductance by binding to Site II and a shift of the voltage dependence of activation of the channel by binding to Site I

. Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain ( VSD ) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain ( PD ) ( Figure 1D ). However, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a very small single-channel conductance and a very low open probability compared to other Kv channels ( Werry et al., 2013 ). The mechanisms behind the small conductance and low open probability are not understood

. If our pore stability hypothesis is correct, we should see altered effects of Lin-Glycine on Gmax when residues important for the PUFA-promoted open-conductive conformation are mutated. We therefore made the mutations Y315F and D317E in KCNQ1. We tested Lin-Glycine on KCNQ1_Y315F/KCNE1 and KCNQ1_D317E/KCNE1 channels and compared the Gmax effect to that of the WT channel

. These changes in the selectivity filter can best be seen in our interpolation video between the states with the S4 segments moving from the resting state to the activated state ( Video 1 ). This gave us the idea that the effect of PUFAs in increasing the maximum conductance of the KCNQ1 channel is linked to their ability to stabilize the pore of the channel in a conductive state

. As shown in Figure 5, the effect of Lin-Glycine on Gmax of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 mutant channel was noticeably reduced compared to the WT channel showing that this residue contributes to the Gmax effect ( Figure 5A ). We also tested the involvement of proline, which makes up a part of the aromatic cuff in the activated state of the channel ( Figure 4C ) by creating the mutant channel KCNQ1_P320L/KCNE1 and found a significant reduction of the Gmax effect for this mutant ( Figure 5A )

. It was previously shown that PUFAs binding at Site II electrostatically interact with the positively charged residue K326, located just outside the selectivity filter ( Liin et al., 2018 ). We tested whether another residue very close to K326, the aspartic acid at position 301, is important for the PUFA interaction at Site II. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that when KCNQ1_WT/KCNE1 was mutated to KCNQ1_D301E/KCNE1, the ΔV0

. For instance, we speculate that in the conductive state, hydrogen bonds between W304-D317 and W305-Y315, which are likely absent in the non-conductive conformation of KCNQ1, are created and that PUFA binding to K326 and D301 at Site II favors the transition toward the conductive state of the channel ( Figure 7 ).

. It was previously shown that several interactions at the pore region of K+ channels are important for ensuring channel conductivity. For example, a feature conserved among K+ channels is the aromatic ring cuff that stabilizes the conducting state and plays a role in C-type inactivation ( Doyle et al., 1998; Larsson and Elinder, 2000; Pless et al., 2013; Kurata and Fed,2006 ). The aromatic cuff in KCN1 is composed of proline and phenylalanine residues ( Figure 4 ). We tested the role of proline by mutating KCN1_P320/KNE and found a significant reduction in Gmax ( Figure 5 ). We also tested the role of phenylalanine by mutating KC1F/KNE and found a significant reduction in Gmax ( Figure 5 ). The proline and phenyline residues are important for the conductive conformation of the channel and PUFA binding at Site II stabilizes this conformation

Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCQ1 is unstable and contributes to the low open probability of the channel and that the PU-induced increase in Gmax is caused by stabilization of the selectivity in the conductive state. PU binding to Site II stabilizes the selectivity in the conductive state by interacting with residues in the selectivity filter and promoting the transition toward the conductive conformation of the channel. PU binding to Site I shifts the voltage dependence of the channel toward more negative voltages and increases Gmax by stabilizing the conductive conformation of the channel.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7, 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

    PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades ( di Salvo et al., 2012 ), yet causal links remain unclear. Aside from vitamin B6 administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking. Here, we identify 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, validating PDXP as a druggable target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain

. Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected

. The identification of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.

Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear ( Mitchell et al., 2014; Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003; Wang et al., 2022b; Behrens et al., 2020; Hassel et al., 2019; Rutjes et al., 2018; Smith and Refsum, 2016; Aisen et al., 2008; Douaud et al., 2013 )

Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system ( Bowling, 2011; Wilson et al., 2019 ), with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age ( di Salvo et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014 )

., 2008; Douaud et al., 2013 ). The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal ( collectively referred to as B6 vitamers ), and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( PLP ) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose

., 2022; Elias et al., 2006 ). Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders ( Tomioka et al., 2018; Toriumi et al., 2021; Arai et al., 2010 ), Alzheimer’s disease ( Paul, 2021 ), and inflammation ( Ueland et al., 2017; Danielski et al., 2018 )

. These observations establish that PDXP is a critical determinant of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus and suggest that intracellular PLP deficiency may be alleviated by PDXP inhibition. Pharmacological small-molecule PDXP inhibitors are currently lacking

., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014 ). Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people ( Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003 ), and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline ( Hughes et al., 2017; Jannusch et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2022; Elias et al., 2006 )

. 3 s ). This may indicate a reorganization of the Mg2+ coordination due to inhibitor binding, and a reorientation of 7, 8-DHF during the PDXP catalytic cycle. The reduced rate of product formation may account for the apparent mixed mode of 7, 8-DHF-mediated PDXP inhibition ( reduction of vmax, see Table 1 ). To investigate cellular target engagement of 7, 8-DHF, we isolated primary hippocampal neurons from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO embryos. PDXP deficiency increased total PLP levels 2

., 2014; Chen et al., 2011 ). Our serendipitous discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects. More potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors may be useful future tools to explore a possible benefit of elevated PLP levels in brain disorders.

. We also present three high-resolution 7, 8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future. Such molecules might improve the control of intracellular PLP levels and help to elucidate a possible contribution of PLP to the pathophysiology of brain disorders

. We did not observe PDXP-dependent changes in PDXK expression ( Figure 4b ) and could not detect PNPO in hippocampal neuronal cultures, suggesting that the PLP increase was primarily caused by the constitutive PDXP loss. To assess the consequences of 7, 8-DHF treatment on PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, we chose short-term incubation conditions ( 45 min, 20 µM ) to avoid possible secondary effects of the inhibitor

. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions ( Percudani and Peracchi, 2003; Eliot and Kirsch, 2004; Percudani and Peracchi, 2009; Parra et al., 2018 ). Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors, including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers, extracellular phosphatases, inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes, and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis ( Wilson et al., 2019 )

. 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models characterized by impaired cognition, and widely regarded as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) agonist with brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) -mimetic activity ( Liu et al., 2016 ). However, a direct TrkB agonistic activity of 7, 8-DHF has been called into question ( Wang et al., 2022a; Boltaev et al., 2017; Pankiewicz et al., 2021; Todd et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2011 )

The hippocampus is important for age-dependent memory consolidation and learning, and impaired memory and learning is associated with PLP deficiency ( di Salvo et al., 2012 ). To study a possible contribution of PDXP and/or PDXK to age-related PLP homeostasis in the hippocampus, we performed western blot analyses in young versus older mice

. To identify PDXP inhibitor candidates, we screened the FMP small-molecule repository containing 41, 182 compounds for molecules able to modulate the phosphatase activity of recombinant, highly purified murine PDXP ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for a schematic of the screening campaign ). 7,8-DHF was identified as a potent inhibitor of PDX with IC50 of 1.4 µM ( Figure 2a ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs; Z1 and Z4 ). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

   . We have shown previously that SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants that have mutations in all five Wnt genes in C. elegans, suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). DTCs, which are the most distal granddaughters of SGPs ( Z1. aa and Z4. pp ), have two functions. First, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2 ( Henderson et al

. In lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 animals, both Z1 and Z4 show HL polarity disrupting the mirror symmetry of polarity. Notably, in this genotype, we observed that the DTC from Z1 frequently migrates posteriorly similar to that from Z4. We further demonstrated that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration

. CWN-1 induces HL polarity for both Z1 and Z4. CWN-2 induces the opposite polarity; LH for Z1 and HL for Z4. EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis

. In the dorsal and ventral sides of the compound eye of Drosophila, ommatidia have mirror-image chirality that is regulated by protocadherins Fat/Dachsous and PCP ( planar cell polarity ) signaling ( Rawls et al., 2002 ). During the development of C. elegans, most cells are polarized in the same anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically to produce distinct daughter cells ( Sawa, 2012 )

. p and P7. p ( Green et al., 2008 ). In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor ( SGP ) cells, Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively, creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells ( DTCs ) from the distal daughters ( Z1. a and Z4. p ) ( Siegfried et al., 2004; Figure 1A and B ). However, it is not known how this mirror-symmetric polarity is established

. As Fz interacts with Disheveled ( DSH ) in Drosophila PCP regulation, in C. elegans, the Disheveled homologs DSH-2 and MIG-5 regulate SGP polarity ( Phillips et al., 2007 ). Therefore, LIN-17 might regulate the DSH homologs in a Wnt-independent manner

. LIN-17 functions in a Wnt-independent manner, as LIN-17 lacking the Wnt binding domain ( cysteine-rich domain [CRD] ) can rescue gonadal defects in compound mutants containing the lin-17 mutation. In the lin-17 background, the three Wnts have distinct functions. Specifically, cwn-1 promotes HL polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while cwn-2 promotes LH and HL polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, egl-20 inhibits HL polarity induced by cwn-1

. It has been reported that the absence of DTCs in mutants of intracellular components of the Wnt signaling pathway ( Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway ) is caused by the loss of polarity of SGPs ( Z1 and Z4 ) which is required for their asymmetric divisions ( Siegfried et al., 2004 ). To determine whether compound mutants of lin-17 and Wnt mutations also affect SGP polarity, we analyzed the localization of sys-1p::GFP::POP-1 ( qIs74 ) after SGP divisions ( Figures 1 and 3 )

., 2007 ), though Fz function can still be regulated by Wnt, as PCP orientation can be directed by ectopically expressed Wnt proteins ( Wu et al., 2013 ). In Drosophila, Fz regulates PCP by interacting with other PCP components including Van Gogh ( Vang ). In C. elegans, we found that vang-1/Vang does not appear to function with LIN-17/Fz, since most vang-1 single mutants and cwn-1 cwn-2 vang-1 triple mutants have two gonadal arms ( 215/216 and 58/58, respectively )

. How are the migratory directions of DTCs controlled? Based on Z1 polarity reversal and the Dpd phenotype in lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 mutants, we initially examined the possibility that the direction of DTC migration correlates with the polarity of the DTC mother cell ( DTC is a granddaughter of Z1/Z4 ) and that the Dpd phenotype is caused by the polarity reversal of the DTC mother

. Since Z1 polarity is completely reversed in lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 at 15°C, the DTC is likely to be produced from Z1. p rather than Z1. a. To understand the relationship between Z1. p polarity and the directions of DTC migration derived from Z1. p, we first examined Z1. p polarity by GFP::POP-1 asymmetry between its daughter cells, and then observed DTC positions after the recovery and growth of the animals. In the observed triple mutants, Z1

. Although the egl-20 mutation suppressed the loss of polarity phenotype in the lin-17; cwn-2 background, it did not in the lin-17; cwn-1 cwn-2 background ( p=0. 6327 and 0. 5741 for symmetric Z1 and Z4 polarity, respectively, between lin-17; cwn-1; cwn-2 and lin-17; cwn-1; egl-20 cwn-2 in comparison of absolute differences at 22. 5°C: Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), suggesting that egl-20 represses cwn-1 function

. To evaluate the effects on SGP polarization irrespective of orientation, we compared the absolute ratios ( on a logarithmic scale ) of signal intensities between proximal and distal daughter cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) rather than the signed ratios described in Figure 3B. Symmetric POP-1 localization in the lin-17 mutant was strongly and moderately enhanced by the cwn-2 mutation for the Z1 and Z4 cells, respectively ( p<0. 0001 for Z1 and p=0. 0108 for Z4 at 15°C; p=0

., 2011 ). In seam cells, Wnt receptors including LIN-17/Fzd and MOM-5/Fzd appear to have Wnt-independent functions for cell polarization, as seam cells are still mostly polarized in the quintuple Wnt mutants, while they are strongly unpolarized in the triple receptor mutants ( lin-17 mom-5 cam-1/Ror ) ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). In Drosophila, Fz/Fzd has been primarily considered to function Wnt-independently to coordinate PCP between neighboring cells ( Lawrence et al

. These results demonstrated that SGP polarity is regulated by the parallel functions of LIN-17/Fz and Wnts. To understand how SGP polarity orientation is regulated, we examined whether Wnt functions are instructive or permissive. We attempted to reverse Wnt gradients by ectopically expressing CWN-1 and CWN-2 which are normally expressed posteriorly and anteriorly relative to the gonad, respectively ( Harterink et al, 2007 ). However, ectopic expression of C-1 and C-2 did not reverse the polarity of Z1 and Z4 (data not shown ) suggesting that Wnts are permissive rather than instructive for SGP polarity

The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure due to the migration of distal tip cells ( DTC ) which are produced by asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z and Z. We found that the polarity of Z and Z is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins C-1 C-2 and EGL-20 with distinct functions. In-17 mutants C-2 promotes polarity in both Z and Z while C-1 promotes and polarity in Z and Z respectively. In contrast EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of Z and Z. In- e- c- c-2 mutants a polarity of Z is reversed and Ds frequently migrate to the posterior. Our analysis demonstrates that mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity of Z leads to mismigration. Mis-migration was also observed in c-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt in coordinating the production and migration of D to establish a mirror-symmetric organ

The text is a scientific research article discussing the development of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm. The researchers found that the development of the gonad is guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTC) which are produced by the asymmetric division of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z and Z. They found that the polarity of Z and Z is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizz receptor and Wnt proteins C- C-2 and EGL-20 with distinct functions. In-17 mutants C-2 promotes polarity in both Z and Z while C-1 promotes polarity in Z and Z respectively. In contrast EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of Z and Z. In- e- c- c-2 mutants a polarity of Z is reversed and D frequently migrate to the posterior. The researchers also found that the misposition of D in the gon due to polarity of Z leads to mismigration. Mis-migration was also observed in c-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic D. The results highlight the role of Wnt in coordinating the production and migration of D to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

    Title: 
    Abstract: There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation. 

    Supporting Text:
   . By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, we reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from more than can be easily phenotyped ( 774 ) to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. With regard to multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs ( Figure 1 ), our finding of multiple mutant classes with different tradeoffs suggests this may not be straightforward

., 2023; Starr et al., 2017 ). The key requirement to being able to implement this approach is having a large collection of barcoded mutants and the ability to re-measure their fitness, relative to a reference strain, in multiple environments, such as the 12 different combinations and concentrations of drugs surveyed here. Across our collection of 774 adaptive yeast lineages, we discovered at least 6 distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across these 12 environments

. The goal of the present study is to count how many different types of adaptive mutation, each type being defined by its unique tradeoffs, exist in a population of drug-resistant yeast. This simple counting exercise is surprisingly difficult. One reason why is that the mutations that provide the strongest fitness advantage often dominate evolution

., 2022; Ksiezopolska et al., 2021 ). However, our primary goal is more generic: we seek to explore the utility of a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug resistant mutant and their associated tradeoffs. To enhance the diversity of drug resistant mutants in our experiment, we performed multiple laboratory evolutions in a range of FLU concentrations and sometimes in combination with a second drug

. Given that these lineages have no fitness advantage in conditions containing no drug, it is also unsurprising that they are underrepresented in evolution experiments lacking RAD and FLU ( Figure 3B ). It might be tempting to generalize that most mutations that provide drug resistance are not beneficial in environments without drugs. Afterall, we show this is true for 100 independent lineages ( Figure 3A )

. The observation that different mutants acting via different resistance mechanisms dominate evolution in only slightly different concentrations of the same drug highlights the complexity of adaptation and the potential benefits of more deeply understanding the diversity of adaptive mechanisms before designing treatment strategies ( Berman and Krysan, 2020; Yang et al., 2023 )

. Some groupings are unintuitive in that they segregate mutations within the same gene ( Figure 6 ) or are distinguished by unexpectedly low fitness in multidrug conditions ( Figure 7 ). These findings are important because they challenge strategies in evolutionary medicine that rely on consistent tradeoffs or intuitive trends when designing sequential drug treatments

., 2023 ). We thus chose to evolve yeast to resist different concentrations and combinations of FLU and RAD to generate a diverse pool of adaptive mutations comprising different mechanisms of drug resistance. We evolved yeast to resist three different concentrations of either FLU or RAD for a total of six single-drug conditions ( Table 1 )

. This highlights how the potential mechanisms by which a microbe can resist a drug may be more varied than is often believed. Typically, one does not search for FLU-resistant mutants by evolving yeast to resist RAD. Thus typical studies might miss this unique class of FLU-resistant mutants. In sum, there appear to be at least two different types of mutants present among our collection of 774 adaptive yeast lineages

. The outlook is further complicated by our finding that some classes of FLU-resistant mutant primarily emerge from evolution experiments that did not contain FLU. This, as well as limits on our power to observe mutants with strong tradeoffs, suggest there may be additional types of FLU-resistant mutant beyond those we sampled. These observations suggest multidrug strategies that assume resistant mutants suffer consistent or common tradeoffs will often fail

. Another key feature is that it captures adaptive lineages before they accumulate multiple mutations such that it is easy to pinpoint which mutation is adaptive. We apply this method to investigate mechanisms underlying resistance to a specific antifungal drug: fluconazole ( FLU; Logan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022 ). Although serious fungal infections are most common in immunocompromised individuals, their impact on global health is still striking, resulting in over 1

. In sum, we have created a diverse pool of 774 barcoded yeast lineages, most of which have a fitness advantage in at least one of the conditions we study and are likely to possess a unique adaptive mutation. The question we address for the rest of this study is to what extent these hundreds of mutant lineages differ from one another in terms of their fitness tradeoffs and the mechanism/s underlying their fitness advantages

. Thus, in the clinic, and in laboratory experiments, the same drug-resistant mutations repeatedly emerge ( Berkow and Lockhart, 2017; Ksiezopolska et al., 2021; Lupetti et al., 2002; Melnikov et al., 2020 ), potentially leading to the false impression that the mechanistic basis of resistance to a particular drug, and the associated tradeoffs, are less varied than may be true

. The intuition here is as follows. If two groups of drug resistant mutants have different fitness tradeoffs, it could mean that they provide resistance through different underlying mechanisms. Alternatively, both could provide drug resistance via the same mechanism, but some mutations might also affect fitness via additional mechanisms ( i. e. they might have unique ‘side-effects’ at the molecular level ) resulting in unique fitness tradeoffs in some environments

., 2020; Wilson et al., 2016 ). In sum, our observation of numerous different types of drug-resistant mutations suggests that designing resistance-detering therapies is challenging, but perhaps not impossible. Outside of predicting the evolution of resistance, our findings provide a tool to investigate the phenotypic impacts of mutation. This task has proven daunting in light of work demonstrating that mutations often have many phenotypic impacts ( Boyle et al

. In order to design better multidrug treatment strategies that thwart resistance, or to see if such strategies are feasible, we need methods to survey a more complete set of mutations and mechanisms that can contribute to resistance. Fortunately, single-cell and single-lineage DNA sequencing technologies are allowing us to more deeply sample genetic diversity in evolving populations of microbes beyond the mutations that dominate evolution ( Schmidt and Efferth, 2016 )

. Doing so revealed mutations that have previously been shown to be adaptive in our evolution conditions ( Supplementary file 1 ). For example, we sequenced many FLU-resistant yeast lineages finding 35 with unique single nucleotide mutations in either PDR1 or PDR3, and a few with mutations in SUR1 or UPC2, genes which have all been shown to contribute to FLU resistance in previous work ( Flowers et al., 2012; Tanaka and Tani, 2018; Uemura and Moriguchi, 2022; Vasicek et al

., 2020; Li et al., 2018b ). Instead of trying to identify the phenotypic or even the genetic basis of adaptation, here we strive to enumerate different classes of FLU-resistant mutants. We sort evolved FLU-resistant yeast strains into classes based on whether they share similar tradeoffs across 12 different environments. The intuition here is as follows

. The majority of the 774 adaptive lineages that we study have higher fitness than the ancestral strains in not one, but often in several drug conditions. This suggests that pleiotropy, and in particular cross-resistance, is prevalent among the lineages we study. But not all lineages show the same patterns of cross-resistance ( Figure 3 )

. By requiring lineages to have high-coverage fitness measurements in all 12 conditions, we exclude adaptive mutants that have severe tradeoffs in one or more environments, consequently blinding ourselves to mutants that may provide resistance via different mechanisms. We find that 6 distinct groups of lineages with characteristic tradeoffs across the 12 drug conditions ( Figure 1 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: The central tendency bias, or contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors, occurring at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities is the central tendency ( ‘contraction’ ) bias, where performance in perceptual tasks seemingly reflects a shift of the working memory ( WM ) representation toward the mean of the sensory history ( Hollingworth, 1910; Jou et al., 2004; Berliner et al., 1977; Hellström, 1985; Raviv et al., 2012; Fischer and Whitney, 2014 )

., 2018; Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011 ). A key feature emerging from these studies is contraction bias, where the averaged performance is as if the memory of the first stimulus progressively shifts toward the center of a prior distribution built from past sensory history ( Figure 1C ). Additionally, biases toward the most recent sensory stimuli ( immediately preceding trials ) have also been documented ( Akrami et al., 2018; Raviv et al., 2012 )

. Rather, in our model, contraction bias emerges as a statistical effect of errors in WM, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials. The integration of this persisting memory in the WM module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects

., 2014 ). Recently, Akrami et al., 2018 found that contraction bias as well as short-term history-dependent effects occur in an auditory delayed comparison task in rats and humans: the comparison performance in a given trial depends on the stimuli shown in preceding trials ( up to three trials back ) ( Akrami et al., 2018 ), similar to previous findings in human 2AFC paradigms ( Raviv et al., 2012 )

., 2019; Barbosa and Compte, 2020 ). Recent evidence, however, challenges this picture: our recent study of a parametric working memory ( PWM ) task discovered that the rat posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias ( Akrami et al., 2018 ). When the region is optogenetically inactivated, contraction bias is attenuated

. Rather, the bump is located more often at the current trial stimulus ( s1t ), and to a lesser extent, at the location of stimuli presented at the previous trial ( s2t−1 ). As a result, contraction bias in our model cannot be attributed to the representation of the running sensory average in the PPC. In the next section, we show how contraction bias arises as an averaged effect when single-trial errors occur due to short-term sensory history biases

. We conclude that contraction biases in such paradigms may not necessarily reflect explicit learning of regularities or an ‘attraction toward the mean’ on individual trials. Rather, it may be an effect emerging at the level of average performance, when in each trial errors are made according to the recent sensory experiences whose distribution follow that of the input stimuli

. Given the finding that PPC neurons carry more information about stimuli presented during previous trials, the PPC module integrates inputs over a longer timescale relative to the WM network and incorporates firing rate adaptation. We find that both contraction bias and short-term sensory history effects emerge in the WM network as a result of inputs from the PPC network. Importantly, we see that these effects do not necessarily occur due to separate mechanisms

. Building on these findings, we suggest a minimal two-module model aimed at better understanding the interaction between contraction bias and short-term history effects. These two modules capture properties of the PPC ( in providing sensory history signals ) and a downstream network holding WM content. Our WM and PPC networks, despite having different timescales, are both shown to encode information about the marginal distribution of the stimuli ( Figure 4A )

. These effects extend to two trials back and are consistent with the performance of humans and rats on the auditory task ( Figure 2D, panels 3–6, data from Akrami et al., 2018 ). It has been shown that inactivating the PPC in rats performing the auditory delayed comparison task markedly reduces the magnitude of contraction bias without impacting non-sensory biases ( Akrami et al., 2018 )

. However, it is important to note that our model is conceptually different, that is, subjects do not have access to the full prior distribution, but only to samples of the prior. We show that having full knowledge of the underlying sensory distribution is not needed to present contraction bias effects. Instead, a point estimate of past events that is updated trial to trial suffices to show similar results

. Intriguingly, however, this is also accompanied by the suppression of bias effects induced by the recent history of the stimuli, suggesting that the two phenomena may be interrelated. Interestingly, other behavioral components, including WM of immediate sensory stimuli ( in the current trial ), remain intact

. Indeed, when we manipulated the parameters of the PPC network in such a way that short-term history effects were eliminated ( by removing the firing rate adaptation ), contraction bias persisted. As a result, our model suggests that contraction bias may not simply be given by a regression toward the mean of the stimuli during the interstimulus interval ( Karim et al

. We show that by analyzing the location of the WM bump at the end of the delay interval, similar to the continuous recall tasks, we can retrieve the averaged effects of contraction bias, similar to previous reports ( Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010 ). Such continuous read-out of the memory reveals a rich dynamics of errors at the level of individual trials, similar to the delayed comparison case, but to our knowledge this has not been studied in previous experimental studies

., 2018 ). We assay the causal role of the PPC in generating the sensory history effects as well as contraction bias by weakening the connections from the PPC to the WM network, mimicking the inactivation of the PPC. In this case, we see that the performance of the psychometric stimuli is greatly improved ( yellow curve, Figure 2E, top panel ), consistent also with the inactivation of the PPC in rodents ( yellow curve, Figure 2E, bottom panel, data from Akrami et al., 2018 )

., 2014; Akrami et al., 2018; Fassihi et al., 2017; Esmaeili and Diamond, 2019 ). These results are consistent with the performance of humans and rats on the auditory task, as previously reported ( Figure 2C, middle and right panels, data from Akrami et al., 2018 ). Can the same circuit also give rise to short-term sensory history biases ( Akrami et al., 2018; Loewenstein et al

distribution of the stimuli, giving rise to contraction bias’ for details )

Contraction bias is an effect emerging in WM tasks, where in the averaged behavior of a subject the magnitude of the item held in memory appears to be larger than it actually is when it is ‘small’ and, vice versa, it appears to be smaller when it is ‘large’ ( Algom, 1992; Berliner et al., 1977; Hellström, 1985; Poulton and Poulton, 1989; Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011; Preuschhof et al., 2010; Olkkonen et al., 2014 ). Recently, Akrami et al

. This is in agreement with Hachen et al., 2021, where the authors used different stimulus ranges across different sessions and noted that rats initiated each session without any residual influence of the previous session’s range/boundary on the current session, ruling out long-term learning of the input structure. Importantly, our results are not limited to the delayed ‘comparison’ paradigm, where binary decision-making occurs

. Quantifying this bias by subtracting the mean performance over all of the previous pairs reveals that the attractive bias is virtually eliminated ( yellow curve, Figure 2F, left panel ), consistent with the inactivation of PPC ( Akram et al,2018 ). This is in contrast to the case where the PPC is active ( blue, Figure 2, left panel, data from Akram et al,2018 ), where the bias is present. This suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating the bias, but not in generating it, as previously suggested by Akram et al. 2018. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of psychophysics experiments of auditory parametric working memory task

The results are consistent with previous findings that the PPC plays a key role in modulating bias ( Akram et al,2018 ) but not generating it, as previously suggested by Akram et al 2018. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral and predictions of performance across different stimulus and timings, delay, as well as neuronal in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of psychophysics of auditory param working memory task

The results are consistent with previous that the PPC plays a role in modulating bias, but not generating, as suggested by Akram et al 2018. Our are consistent with a set behavioral and predictions of performance across stimulus and timings, delay, as well as neuronal putative memory. We validate our model by performing a set of psychophysics of auditory working memory task

    Title: 
    Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

   . In particular, we tested whether systemic administration of nanoparticle-encapsulated PDLIM2-expression plasmids ( nanoPDLIM2 ) could enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and/or chemotherapeutic drugs. We also examined whether PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves genetic deletion and its relationship with epigenetic silencing

. Notably, systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reverses the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.

. More importantly, these preclinical data establish a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals and is also with high safety profile. We believe that these knowledges are applicable to other cancers, because PDLIM2 repression has also been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer.

. Given the role of PDLIM2 in inhibiting the expression of cell survival and proliferation genes in tumor cells, which contribute to chemoresistance, we tested whether nanoPDLIM2 increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in the mouse model of lung cancer. Treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, two chemotherapeutic drugs that are often used together as the first-line treatment for lung and many other cancers, led to significant decrease in tumor number and tumor burden ( Figure 4A )

. While nanoPDLIM2-based combination therapies could be applicable to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the mechanisms involved, epigenetic therapy may be used to treat about 26% of lung tumors with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression only. About 58% of lung tumors harboring PDLIM2 LOH are not suitable to epigenetic therapies, although most of them are also with epigenetic alterations of the pdlim2 gene

. Thus, PDLIM2 nanotherapy improves the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy through blocking both intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance of lung cancer cells. High expression of cell survival genes also renders tumor cells resistant to the tumoricidal activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ), including those unleashed by ICIs. PDLIM2 nanotherapy should also enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, given its ability in suppressing the expression of cell survival genes

. It delivered PDLIM2-expression plasmids to lung tumor tissues and showed undetectable toxicity in the animal model. Its combination does not further increase the toxicity of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. This is in sharp contrast to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved epigenetic drugs, which can restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression ( Sun et al., 2019; Guo and Qu, 2021; Qu et al., 2010a; Qu et al., 2010b; Sun et al

., 2019; Garassino et al., 2020; Leonetti et al., 2019 ), significant further improvement is direly needed. Using an authentic mouse model of lung cancer, we show, for the first time, that PDLIM2 nanotherapy shows efficacy and high safety, and more importantly, induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals when it is combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs

. Consistent with the treatment efficacy, a high level of PDLIM2 was detected in the lung tumors from mice treated with the PDLIM2 plasmid nanoparticles one week post nanoPDLIM2 treatment, whereas no obvious PDLIM2 was found in the lung tumors from mice treated with the control plasmid nanoparticles ( Figure 3A and B ). It should be pointed out that the tumor delivery efficiency of PDLIM2-expression or control plasmid nanoparticles was similarly high ( Figure 3B )

., 2019 ). While PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in human lung cancer, associating with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis, its global or lung epithelial-specific deletion in mice leads to lung cancer development, chemoresistance, and complete resistance to anti-PD-1 and epigenetic drugs

. Importantly, combination with nanoPDLIM2 further significantly decreased both tumor number and tumor burden, suggesting a promising synergy between PDLIM2 nanotherapy and chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment. Consistently, significantly higher tumor cell apoptosis was detected in mice treated with the combination therapy, in comparison to those with nanoPDLIM2 or chemotherapy alone ( Figure 4B )

. To overcome this limitation and expand PDLIM2-targeted therapy to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the involved mechanisms, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of systemic administration of PDLIM2-expression plasmids encapsulated by the clinically feasible in vivo-jetPEI ( Matouk et al., 2013; Buscail et al., 2015; Nyamay’Antu et al., 2019; Bonnet et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013 )

. Accordingly, combination of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, like the combination therapies of nanoPDLIM2 and anti-PD-1 or chemotherapeutic drugs, also failed to induce a complete remission of lung tumors in any mice

., 2019 ). It also leads to strong induction of multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) for acquired chemo-resistance, as chemotherapy further enhances RelA activation for MDR1 transcription in PDLIM2 deficient tumor cells ( Sun et al., 2019 ). In this study, we examined whether and how PDLIM2 can be targeted to treat lung cancer in a faithful mouse model of human lung cancer

. Although reversal of PDLIM2 epigenetic repression by epigenetic drugs to restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells may be used to treat lung cancer ( Sun et al., 2019 ), it is logical that this approach cannot be applied to lung tumors involving PDLIM2 LOH, which accounts for about 58% of all lung cancer cases

. Furthermore, NanoPDLIM2 increased the number of TILs and the expression of MHC-I, the most important and core components of immunotherapies including PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy ( Figure 5A and B ). In line with our previous studies ( Sun et al., 2019 ), PD-1 blocking antibody showed some efficacies in the mouse model of lung cancer, as evidenced by the significant decrease in tumor burden and tumor number ( Figure 5C )

. Moreover, PDLIM2 nanotherapy prevents the induction of MDR1 and the expression of tumor-related genes and in particular cell survival genes, further sensitizing tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune cells including those recruited by chemotherapy and unleashed by PD-1 blockade

. Mouse appearance and behaviors, such as eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sniffing, grooming, and digging, were not different between PDLIM2-expression and control plasmid nanoparticle groups ( data not shown ). Taken together, these data suggested the therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity of PDLIM2-based nanotherapy in the mouse model of refractory lung cancer

. PDL2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive chemo and immunoresistance, suggesting a new target for lung therapy improvement. In this study, human samples were used to investigate PDL2 genetic and epigen changes in cancer. An endogenous lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human cancer and clinically nano-delivery system were used to investigate the efficacy, mechanism and safety of systemically administrated PIM expression plasm encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoDL2 ) and its combination with PD-1 and chemother drugs. Our results indicate thatDL2 in lung cancer involves both genetic and epigen alteration. nanoDL showed low toxicity high specificity antitumor activity and improved the efficacy of-P-1 and chemother drugs with complete remission in most mice and tumor reduction in remaining by triple. Mechanistically nanoDL increased MHC I expression suppressed MDR induction and survival genes and tumor-related expression in cells and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration turning tumors hot and sensitive to ICs and chemother drugs and activated TILs unleashed by IC. These studies established a clinically applicableDL-based therapy with efficacy for lung and possibly other cancers

The final answer is: 

This study investigated the role of PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) in lung cancer and its potential as a target for therapy. PIM is a tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer and drives chemoresistance and immunoresistance. The study used human samples and a mouse model of lung cancer to investigate PIM genetic and epigen changes and the efficacy of systemically administered PIM-expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoIM) combined with PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed that PIM repression in lung involves genetic and epigen alteration. NanoIM showed low toxicity, high specificity, and antitumor activity and improved the efficacy of PD-1 and chemother drugs with complete remission in most mice and tumor reduction in remaining by triple. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction, and survival and tumor-related gene expression in cells, and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to IC and chem drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (T) unleashed by IC. These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy with efficacy for lung and possibly other cancers.

    Title: 
    Abstract: To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPRER and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established ( Qi et al., 2017 ), we elucidated the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis

. This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors ( Figure 6 )

., 2021 ). Therefore, this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory nervous system. One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-E. coli activates UPRER and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-E. coli may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPRER and immunity, respectively

. coli ) by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, which is mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-E. coli, Saprophytic staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and helping animals avoid these environments. We then investigated which nutrients/metabolites are sensed by animals through the XBP-1-PMK-1 axis for food quality evaluation

. This implies that animals may assess the quality of food through UPRER and innate immune pathway. To determine whether the UPRER and innate immune pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, we first examined whether the activation of the UPRER by HK-E. coli was dependent on the known signaling components of the UPRER branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4 and ATF-6 ( Hetz et al., 2020; Ron and Walter, 2007 )

. Together, these data indicate that the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is critical for evaluating whether food is of higher quality and can be eaten by animals. It also suggests that animals could improve their VC levels to adapt to bad food environment. As D-GlcA/sugar and VC supplementation suppressed HK-E. coli induced UPRER, immune response and food avoidance behavior, we investigated whether animals evaluate sugar and VC through XBP and PMK-1 dependent pathways

., 2020 ). The p38 PMK-1 pathway is also crucial for regulating the expression of secreted innate immune effectors and is essential for survival during infection ( Troemel et al., 2006 ). Therefore, these two pathways play a critical role in ensuring animals' survival in changing environments. However, it is still unclear whether UPRER and innate immunity evaluate food quality under physiological conditions. Our study provides evidence that low-quality food ( HK-E

Collectively, this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals. It also highlights the utility of the HK-E. coli ( low-quality food ) - C. elegans interaction as a means to dissect the mechanism of food evaluation system in assessing food

. Moreover, UPRMt reporter ( Phsp-6::GFP ) ( Yoneda et al., 2004 ) was weakly induced under HK-E. coli feeding condition ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ), and starved worm did not induce UPRER and immunity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D ). Together, these findings suggest that low-quality food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ) triggers a stress response pathway in animals, including UPRER and innate immune pathway

. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPRER ( Richardson et al., 2010 ) and PMK-1/p38 MAPK ( Kim et al

. coli. Secondly, we hypothesized that animals could overcome a low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ) environment by inhibiting the stress response through increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. We found that VC or D-glucuronate ( D-GlcA ) supplementation inhibits HK-E. coli induced UPRER ( Figure 4D ), immune response including irg-5/sysm-1 reporter expression ( Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) and p-PMK-1 ( Figure 4F and G ), as well as food avoidance ( Figure 4H )

. These data suggest that PMK-1 regulated immune pathway evaluates low-quality food, especially the neuronal PMK-1 has a critical function for food quality response. Next, we explored the connection between UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) and innate immunity ( PMK-1 p38 MAPK ) in food quality evaluation. We found that Pirg-5::GFP induction ( Figure 2—figure supplements 1I and 2A ) and PMK-1 activation ( Figure 2E ) were decreased in animals with xbp-1 mutation or knockdown when fed with HK-E

. coli ) and regulates gut digestive activity to impact animal’s food behavior ( Qi et al., 2017 ). To further identified the mechanism by which animals evaluate low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ), we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to identify specific nutrition deficiencies in low-quality food and the cellular response pathways that are involved in food evaluation pathway

. This indicates that XBP-1-dependent UPRER activation in neuron is critical for animals to specific evaluate low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ). We then investigated which innate immune pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food. First, we analyzed HK-E. coli-induced genes from RNA-seq. Among these up-regulated genes, 82 out of 409 of PMK-1-dependent genes ( Fletcher et al., 2019 ) were identified ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, Supplementary file 2c )

. Previous studies have shown that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ) is a low-quality food source that cannot support the growth of C. elegans larvae ( Qi and Han, 2018; Qi et al., 2017 ), whereas supplementation with vitamin B2 ( VB2 ) can restore animal growth ( Qi et al., 2017 ). Here, we found that sugar deficiency in HK-E. coli induces the UPRER-immune response and avoidance behavior in C. elegans

., 2020; Qu et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, IRE-1 has been found to confer cold resistance independently of XBP-1 by activating JNK-1 MAPK ( Melo and Ruvkun, 2012 ). In contrast, our study reveals a new mechanism where the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) positively regulates Innate Immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) under HK-E. coli food conditions, establishing a novel physiological food evaluation system that activates the cellular stress response program

., 2006; Ni et al., 2013; Scott, 2018 ). Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors ( Jones and Candido, 1999; Xie et al., 2022 ). This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food

. However, we did find that carbohydrates are critical for inhibiting the UPRER-immune response induced by sugar deficiency in HK-E. coli. Together, these findings suggest that HK-E. coli induces a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be overcome by supplementing with VC or D-glucate ( D-GA ), which inhibits the UPR-PM-1 regulated stress response. Our study highlights the role of cellular stress pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival in natural environments.

    Title: 
    Abstract: As a major class of biomolecules, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes. However, it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Here, we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a drug target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs. Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study, we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14, and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7. Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14, a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 [KDKE] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. 

    Supporting Text:
   . The ligand-binding models of different UDP-sugars ( UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-GlcNAc ) were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar recognition site of P2Y14. Both P2Y14 and P2Y12 were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as their agonists targeting the conserved functional motif.

., 2017 ). P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) represents an outstanding model system for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs. It belongs to P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, consisting of receptors responding to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP ( Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). Distinct from the other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, that is, UDP-sugars ( Abbracchio et al., 2006; Jacobson et al., 2020 )

. The different arrangements of UDP-sugar-binding sites between P2Y14 and these sugar transferases might be determinant for their sugar selectivity. In conclusion, we revealed a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in both P2Y12 and P2Y14, extending our understanding of how carbohydrates regulate GPCRs

. In addition, in the studies involving the other UDP-sugars, we also found that the interactions between sugar-moieties of agonists with TM7 ( E2787. 36 ) is determinant for UDP-sugars’ potencies ( Figure 3 ). The carbohydrate-binding site has not been fully characterized for GPCRs. Except for P2Y14, it has not been reported that the other members of P2Y12-like subfamily can be directly activated by carbohydrates

. Our molecular models of different sugar nucleotides provide great details for carbohydrate activation and recognition of these receptors, which would inspire further carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. Whether the other carbohydrate-binding motifs exist in GPCRs is currently unknown. Further investigations focused on carbohydrate regulation of GPCRs will continue to add both new concepts and physiological understanding to the field.

., 2014a ). Since P2Y12 is highly similar to P2Y14 with 45. 67% amino acid sequence identity, it would be interesting to investigate whether this receptor is also sensible to sugar nucleotides. Here, we combined molecular docking, molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations, and functional study to reveal the molecular mechanism how P2Y14 is activated by a sugar nucleotide

. 60-D812. 64-K2777. 35-E2787. 36 salt bridging chain as an important functional site for sugar moiety recognition and UDP-sugar activation of P2Y14. These four residues ( K2. 60, D2. 64, K7. 35, and E7. 36 ) are conserved between P2Y14 and its closest homolog, that is, P2Y12 ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). Therefore, we assumed that P2Y12 can also be activated by carbohydrate ligands

. Integrated computational modeling with mutagenesis study, we identified a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif ( KDKE ) for both P2Y14 and P2Y12 ( Figure 4 ). The KDKE motif not only participates in receptor activation by bridging TM2 and TM7 ( K772. 60, D812. 64, K2777. 35, and E2787. 36 ) ( Figure 2 ), but also recognize different sugar moieties, including glucose, galactose, glucuronic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine groups ( Figure 3, Figure 4 )

., 2006; Jacobson et al., 2020 ). UDP-sugars activate P2Y14 with a relative potency order of UDP-glucose ( UDP-Glc ), UDP-galactose ( UDP-Gal ), UDP-glucuronic acid ( UDP-GlcA ), and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine ( UDP-GlcNAc ) ( Chambers et al., 2000; Hamel et al., 2011; Ko et al., 2009; Ko et al., 2007 ). These sugar nucleotides act as important signaling molecules via P2Y14 to mediate many physiological processes ( Amison et al., 2017; Breton and Brown, 2018; Ferreira et al

. 3 ± 1. 5 nM ) than the other UDP-sugars, that is, UDP-Gal ( EC50=78. 3 ± 9. 2 nM ), UDP-GlcA ( EC50=59. 9 ± 4. 8 nM ), and UDP-GlcNAc ( EC50=184. 4 ± 11. 8 nM ) ( Figure 3A and B ). To investigate how P2Y14 recognizes different sugar moieties, we performed MD simulations of the human P2Y14 receptor complex with UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively, and compared them with the UDP-Glc-bound P2Y14 simulations

., 2017; Müller et al., 2005; Sesma et al., 2016 ). UDP-Glc is also released from liver cells in obese states, possibly via hepatocellular apoptosis, leading to liver inflammation and insulin resistance ( Wang et al., 2008 ). All these results indicate importance of UDP-sugar regulation of P2Y14 in pathological progresses. In this work, we built the molecular model of UDP-Glc-bound P2Y14 to answer the long-standing question of sugar nucleotide regulation of the purinergic receptor

. These findings indicate that sub-pocket 2 residues of TM2 provide major contributions to stabilizing the sugar moiety of UDP-Glc. The molecular docking employs rigid side chains of the receptor and does not include the influence of explicit environment on molecular interactions. To investigate how UDP-Glc interacts with P2Y14, we performed all-atom MD simulations of the P2Y14 receptor with and without UDP-Glc ( Figure 2A )

As significant components of the organism, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in energy supply, cell signaling, and immune responses ( Gagneux and Varki, 1999 ). Dysregulation of carbohydrates has been proved to be associated with the development of various diseases ( Reily et al., 2019 ). However, it is still elusive how carbohydrates directly act on major therapeutic targets, including G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Cheng and Jiang, 2019; Hauser et al., 2017 )

. Compared with the UDP-bound receptor model ( Figure 1E ), the UDP-Glc-bound model showed extra interactions between the glucose moiety and the TM2, TM3, TM7, and ECL2 of P2Y14 ( Figure 1F ), enhancing the binding of UDP-Glc. Based on these molecular docking models, we further decomposed the ligand-binding energy to each receptor residue ( Figure 1G ). Five residues ( K772. 60, D812. 64, N903. 21, I170ECL2, and E2787

These findings not only validate our assumption that P2Y12 can be activated by sugar nucleotides, but also indicate the conserved KDKE salt bridging chain as a functional motif for both PY14 and P2.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts, NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development. 

    Supporting Text:
   . To investigate the role of iron homeostasis in Drosophila CNS, we tried to knock down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NBs, neurons, and glial cells, respectively. Interestingly, only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. It appears that ferritin generated in glial cells is the only crucial protein for regulating the behavior of NBs and, ultimately, the larval brain development

. In a proliferative state, NBs receive iron from glial cells via ferritin to fulfill the energy requirements for proliferation and self-renewal. Therefore, the iron required by NBs is mainly stored in the ferritin of glial cells and allocated as needed. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells

. Furthermore, glial cells can subsequently clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets ( Bailey et al., 2015 ), ensuring normal NB function during neural development. It is intriguing to explore whether bicellular iron homeostasis exists in other stem cells and their niches. When normal NBs are converted into immortal tumor NBs, becoming highly proliferative, they need more nutrients including iron ( Bonnay et al., 2020; van den Ameele and Brand, 2019 )

. However, it remains elusive whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal, and differentiation. Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities

. We observed that the size of tumors was strikingly decreased in the larval brains lacking glial ferritin ( Figure 6A and B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B ). This result suggests that glial ferritin is required for tumor development, highlighting a potential target for tumor treatment. To verify whether iron is involved in the tumor suppression induced by blocking glial ferritin, we tried to decrease iron levels by adding the iron chelator BPS in the Drosophila food

. However, it is unknown whether the glial niche is required for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs. In this study, we demonstrate that the glial niche maintains the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs through supplying the necessary microelement iron into NBs for enough energy production, which implies that mammalian glia likewise provide critical microelement for maintaining NSC function. Oligodendrocytes have been reported to secret ferritin to protect neurons ( Mukherjee et al

. Iron homeostasis can be regulated systemically by the liver-derived hormone hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin, and it is also regulated cellularly by the IRP/IRE system ( Hentze et al., 2010 ). Here, we propose a bicellular iron homeostasis between NB and glial niche cell, which is distinct from classic cellular and systemic iron homeostasis. The bicellular iron homeostasis requires an elaborate mechanism to guarantee normal neurogenesis

. We have demonstrated that glial ferritin is essential for NB self-renewal and proliferation by providing glia-to-NB iron transport to support energy production in NBs. We next tried to determine whether manipulating this biological function could suppress tumor development. We induced tumor development by driving UAS-brat-RNAi or UAS-numb-RNAi under the control of Insc-GAL4, and knocked down ferritin genes under the control of repo-lexA

. In this way, BBB glia separates the labile systemic iron from local iron inside the brain to guarantee the normal brain development, as the neural cells, including NBs, require a stable iron level for continuous energy generation during neurogenesis. Although the dominant function of ferritin is iron storage in mammals, increasing evidences suggest that ferritin also can transport iron

. Additionally, similar but weaker phenotypes were observed when Fer1HCHDN, a ferroxidase-inactive form of Fer1HCH ( Missirlis et al., 2007 ), was overexpressed in glial cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3D ). These results support the conclusion that ferritin in glial cells is essential for the maintenance and proliferation of NBs, suggesting that iron homeostasis is involved in this process

., 2019 ). These findings underscore the pivotal role of ferritin in iron transport. Interestingly, iron-loaded ferritin, serving as an essential mitogen, promotes proliferation of cultured Drosophila cells ( Li, 2010 ). Therefore, it is tempting to investigate whether ferritin is required for self-renewal and the proliferation of NSCs during brain development

. Here, we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur ( Fe-S ) clusters, which is necessary for the production of ATP, providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs, highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor.

. This may be due to the possibility that the knockdown of glial ferritin largely, if not completely, prevented the transport of iron from glia to NBs, which hindered the additional iron from entering NBs. These results indicate that the NB loss phenotype induced by glial ferritin knockdown is primarily due to iron deficiency in NBs

. Altogether, blocking iron in the tumor is a potential therapy for tumor suppression. The aforementioned results have highlighted the significant role of glial ferritin in controlling NB number and proliferation. We next wondered whether NBs could provide feedback to regulate glial ferritin levels. To answer this question, we analyzed ferritin levels after altering NB proliferation

., 2020; van den Ameele and Brand, 2019 ). In response, more ferritin is generated to transport iron from the glial cells to NBs. However, it is unclear how NBs communicate with glial cells to determine the level of ferritin production. It’s interesting to identify the specific cues from NBs that regulate the level of ferritin in future studies

., 2014 ). To investigate whether the NB loss phenotype of glial ferritin knockdown is caused by defective iron transport, we next sought to identify the role of Zip13 in the larval brain. First, we examined the expression pattern of Zip13 and found that, similar to ferritin, the DsRed stinger driven by Zip13-GAL4 was co-localized with Repo in glial cells rather than Dpn in NBs ( Figure 3D and D’ )

. To determine the underlying cause of the brain development defects observed upon glial ferritin knockdown, we used iron chelator or iron salt ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC ) to manipulate iron intake and detect how it will influence NBs. We observed that depriving iron intake by adding iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium ( BPS ) to the food led to a dramatic decrease in the number and proliferation rate of NBs, compared to control larvae on normal food ( Figure 3A )

. Together, we conclude that it is iron deficiency in NBs, rather than iron overload in glial cells, that leads to NB loss induced by ferritin defects. To further prove that defective iron transport leads to the iron deficiency in NBs, we examined the iron availability by measuring aconitase activity in the brain. The activity of aconitase is sensitive to the level of Fe-S synthesis, so it can serve as an indicator of the availability of iron in the cell ( Haile et al

., 2018 ). Additionally, previous studies have shown that iron-loaded ferritin can promote the proliferation of cultured cell from Drosophila ( Li, 2010 ). Furthermore, iron depletion was reported to suppress human cancer cells growth at G1/S by inducing cyclin D1 proteolysis ( Nurtjahja-Tjendraputra et al., 2007 ). These studies suggest that iron, as a necessary microelement for energy production, is essential to NSC maintenance and tumor suppression

In this study, we demonstrate that glial ferritin is required for the self-renew and proliferation of NB by supplying iron to NB for energy production, which is critical for the development of the larval brain. We also show that glial ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression, and that the level of glial ferr production is affected by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. This study reveals a novel role of the glial niche during brain development and highlights the importance of iron homeasis in the regulation of self-renew and proliferation of NSCs.
Researchers analyzed US vital statistics to understand the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality during the pandemic. They considered death certificates listing cancer as the underlying cause of death (UC) or anywhere on the death certificate (multiple cause [MC]). In contrast to earlier studies, they propose that lack of excess cancer mortality during COVID-19 reflects competing mortality from cancer, especially for deadly types like pancreatic and lung, rather than protection from immunosuppression. The study found modest elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 in the US, with a 3% increase over pre-pand baseline, corresponding to ~13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2-7%) than with poor survival (lung, pancreatic, 0-1%). In comparison, there was elevation in deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer's (19%). To understand differences, they simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each. They found observed differences primarily explained by life expectancy, with risk from deadly cancers outcompeting death from COVID-19. Mortality series from UC and diabetes, Alzheimer's were correlated with COVID-activity, with significant elevation during pandemic waves. For diabetes, an excess 10,800 and 82,300 deaths (UC, respectively), corresponding to significant elevations 16 and 37 over baseline mortality.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture —the Smc5/6 complex— plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In conclusion, our work demonstrates a direct and active involvement of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic chromosomes. We showed the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity

. Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops

. These results suggest that the severe growth defects of yeast defective in both RNase H and the Smc5/6 complex can be linked to an accumulation of R-loops in the chromosomes of these cells. R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also be formed at telomeres and near DNA replication forks ( Figure 4A )

. Next, we investigated whether binding of the SMC5/6 complex to an R-loop substrate can affect its degradation and/or stability in vitro. RNase H1 and RNase H2 are the primary enzymes responsible for the removal of R-loops in chromosomes, but recent studies suggest that RNase H2 is the only one that acts throughout the cell cycle ( Lockhart et al., 2019; Zimmer and Koshland, 2016 )

. We favor a model where the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels –within and between pathways– in the cellular response to R-loop formation ( Figure 7 ). First, Smc5/6 contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the execution of this function, the Smc5/6 role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes ( more on this below )

In eukaryotes, two partially overlapping enzymes mediate the degradation of R-loops; RNase H1 and RNase H2 ( Figure 1A; Lazzaro et al., 2012; Lockhart et al., 2019 ). To determine whether the Smc5/6 complex contributes to R-loop repair in proliferating cells, we introduced the smc6-9 and nse4-4 alleles of the Smc5/6 complex ( Figure 1B ) into budding yeast strains defective for RNase H1 ( rnh1Δ ) and RNase H2 ( rnh201Δ/rnh202Δ/rnh203Δ ) activity

. Maintaining a finely balanced cycle of R-loop formation and removal in chromosomes is crucial for the overall fitness of cells because altered RNA-DNA hybrid homeostasis can result in DNA damage and genomic instability, ultimately contributing to the development of several pathological conditions ( Mackay et al., 2020; Crossley et al., 2023 ). Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex promotes the removal of toxic R-loops in eukaryotic chromosomes

. To identify the source of R-loops that are substrates for the Smc5/6 complex, we introduced mutant alleles of the Smc5/6 complex in yeast backgrounds that accumulate R-loops ( or RNA-DNA hybrid structures ) at specific genomic locations. We first asked if unscheduled R-loops formed during active transcription are natural substrates/targets of the Smc5/6 complex

. However, a definitive understanding of the sequence of events and exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the repair of R-loops/RNA-DNA hybrids remains to be established. Work from our laboratory and other researchers provides hints of a possible involvement of structural maintenance of chromosomes ( SMC ) -type complexes in RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Serrano et al., 2020; Girasol et al., 2023; Penzo et al., 2023 )

. Taken together, these results indicate that the promotion of R-loop degradation by the SMC5/6 complex does not depend on this enzyme establishing a strong physical interaction with RNase H2.

. How might the Smc5/6 complex association with R-loops promote their degradation in vivo? Hints of a potential mechanism of action come from the observation that one of the enzymes responsible for R-loop degradation, RNase H1, shows little enzymatic activity under basal conditions and requires stimulation by ancillary factors, such as RPA, to achieve maximal R-loop degradation ( Nguyen et al., 2017 )

. This interpretation dovetails nicely with the synthetic interaction profiles we observed when combining Smc5/6 complex mutations with mutants that increase R-loop formation at selected genomic locations ( Figure 4 ). Taken together, our genetic analyses indicate that the repertoire of genomic lesions that are substrates for RNase H2 and the Smc5/6 complex in vivo is not fully overlapping

. To mitigate the toxic consequences associated with the presence of unprogrammed RNA-DNA hybrids in chromosomes, several cellular mechanisms work in concert to prevent their formation, and when they do accumulate, remove them from eukaryotic genomes. For instance, the Ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) family of enzymes plays a central role in degrading the RNA moiety of R-loops created under a variety of genomic conditions ( Lazzaro et al., 2012; Lockhart et al., 2019; Figure 1A )

. Overall, these genetic analyses suggest that R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres are likely physiological targets for the Smc5/6 complex. The role we uncovered above for the Smc5/6 complex prompted us to investigate whether this enzyme was capable of recognizing R-loop structures directly

., 2023 ). In addition, factors associated with transcription and mRNA biogenesis, RNA-DNA helicases, topoisomerases, chromatin remodelers, and several DNA repair enzymes are known to be involved alongside RNase H in preventing the accumulation of R-loop structures in eukaryotic chromosomes ( García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019 )

., 2014; Pebernard et al., 2008 ). We showed that inactivation of Smc5/6 components leads to an increase in R-loop formation at several of these loci in the absence of RNase H enzyme activity, a result that aligns nicely with Smc5/6 complex localization in live cells. Our genetic enhancement results obtained with double mutants must be interpreted carefully because they involve conditional/hypomorphic alleles of Smc5/6 complex components

. We also observed that the purified RNase H2 enzyme was not active on a D-loop structure, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the enzyme in our reaction conditions ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ). Next, we incubated increasing concentrations of the SMC5/6 complex with the R-loop substrate in the absence of RNase H2. Under these conditions, the complex did not induce degradation of the RNA moiety or otherwise affect the stability of the R-loop structure ( lanes 2–6; Figure 6C )

., 2022; Kemiha et al., 2021 ). In this context, losing both RNase H and Smc5/6 complex activities will have consequences well beyond those observed in individual mutants because it will increase R-loop formation in a context where cells have lost the ability to cope with stress at replication forks. This ‘dual hit’ will render cells hypersensitive to R-loops, thus explaining the synthetic effects of combining smc5/6 and rnase H mutations

. During transcription, nascent RNA transcripts can re-anneal to complementary DNA strands producing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displace the template strand, creating an obstacle to the progression of the DNA replication machinery. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced ssDNA segment —together termed the R-loop— are highly deleterious for genome integrity ( Chatzidoukaki et al., 2021; Costantino and Koshland, 2018; De Magis et al., 2019; Stork et al., 2016 )

. However, in the presence of low levels of Sm5/6, we observed that R-lo degradation was significantly reduced ( lanes 7–10; Figure 6C ), indicating that Sm5/6 promotes RNase2-mediated degradation of the RNA moiety of R-lo in vitro

The Smc/6 complex is a component of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins, which are involved in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. The Sm/6 complex has been implicated in the repair of double-strand breaks and telomere maintenance in eukary chromosomes. Here, we show that the Sm/6 complex also plays a role in the removal of R-loops formed during transcription and telomere regulation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing. To this end, the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ). First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1, T2 ). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies. 

    Supporting Text:
   . This will be addressed next. On the basis of the full ( T1 and T2 ) dataset, we aimed to replicate our key T1 results and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain–behaviour relationship would hold across time: we expected an individual’s neural filtering ability to impact their listening performance ( accuracy and response speed ) independently of age or hearing status ( Tune et al., 2021 ). Given the moderately strong correlation of age and hearing acuity ( r = –0

. However, when analysed in our longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, irrespective of the precise definition of neural filtering, we did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain–behaviour links observed within each timepoint

In a first analysis ( Figure 3 ), we characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan. Additionally, we analysed longitudinal change from timepoint 1 ( T1 ) to timepoint 2 ( T2 ). We used the same linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time. We additionally quantified each measure’s test–retest reliability as their T1–T2 Pearson’s correlation

. Since we previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering to be independent of age and hearing status, we did not expect any systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering. Second, we test the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed ( Figure 1A )

. Importantly, the behavioural outcome of interest, that is, the speed and accuracy with which an ageing individual solves a difficult listening situation, involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes ( Anderson et al., 2013; Peelle, 2016 ). We here focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories

. The results presented here support the role of attention-guided neural filtering as a readout of an individual’s neural attentional state. At the same time, the state-like nature of neural tracking-based metrics limits their translational potential as predictors of longitudinal change in listening behaviour over middle to older adulthood

., 2018; Buschman and Kastner, 2015 ). This entails that at a longer time scale, here captured by two distinct measurement timepoints, ageing individuals will differ with respect to their overall level of neural filtering and associated listening behaviour. Their level of neural and behavioural functioning will differ from other individuals’ levels at the same timepoint but also from their own level at a different timepoint

. The conclusion stands, though, that individual trajectories in listening behaviour cannot be explained by longitudinal change along a single dimension. Instead, a better understanding of the influences shaping individual listening behaviour across the adult lifespan will critically rely on uncovering the relative contribution and age-dependent dynamics of sensory, neural, and cognitive factors

. First, by focusing on each domain individually, we ask how sensory, neural, and behavioural functioning evolve cross-sectionally across the middle and older adult lifespan ( Figure 1B ). More importantly, we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied 2-year period ( Figure 1C, Q1 ), and whether ageing individuals differ significantly in their degree of change ( Q2 ). We expect individuals’ hearing acuity and behaviour to decrease from T1 to T2

. However, it has long been recognised that increasing age and hearing loss cannot fully account for the considerable degree of inter-individual differences observed in listening behaviour and its lifespan change ( Akeroyd, 2008; Houtgast and Festen, 2008; Humes et al., 2012 ). Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that promote successful speech comprehension by implementing ‘neural filters’ that segregate behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds

. While most desirable from a translational perspective and a core quest in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing, predicting change in cognitive functioning, here listening behaviour, from baseline or longitudinal change in brain function or structure is a non-trivial endeavour. Connecting individual trajectories of neural or cognitive functioning goes beyond the establishment of domain-specific age trends ( Lindenberger et al., 2011; Tucker-Drob et al., 2022 )

. In this analysis, the inclusion of interactions by timepoint tested whether the influence of age, sensory acuity, and neural filtering on behaviour varied significantly across time. Our expectations on the direct relationships were indeed borne out by the data: higher age was associated with poorer hearing ability ( β = –0. 43, SE = 0. 09, p<0. 001 ) and listening performance ( speed: β = –0. 33, SE = 0. 06, p<0. 001; accuracy: β = –0. 26, SE = 0. 06, p<0. 001 )

., 2018 ), we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways: we ask whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change ( Q3 ), and whether 2-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour ( Q4 )

The analysed data are part of a large-scale longitudinal study on the neural and cognitive mechanisms supporting adaptive listening behaviour in a prospective cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults ( ‘The listening challenge: How ageing brains adapt ( AUDADAPT ) ’; https://cordis. europa. eu/project/rcn/197855_en. html )

. 21. 8; Neale et al., 2016 ). As the first step of our three-part analysis approach, we applied general linear mixed-effect models to test for cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in trait-level sensory acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance. These models included age, timepoint, and their interaction as fixed effect regressors and allowed random participant-specific intercepts

. Yet, ageing individuals may rely on different alternative neural or cognitive strategies ( Tune et al., 2018 ). A complete understanding of inter-individual differences in listening behaviour in ageing adults will therefore depend on a number of different factors among which the attention-modulated tracking of relevant speech constitutes one, potentially necessary, but not sufficient neural correlate ( Wöstmann et al., 2020; Obleser and Kayser, 2019; Tune et al., 2021; Gillis et al

. 008, SE = 0. 03, p=0. 77 ). Again, the hearing-acuity-mediated effect of age on accuracy did not change from T1 to T2 as evidenced by moderated mediation analysis ( interaction by timepoint p=0. 73 ). Speaking to the robustness of our previous results, we observed the beneficial effect of stronger neural filtering fidelity on both measures of listening performance ( accuracy: β = 0. 21, SE = 0. 09, p=0. 02; speed: β = 0. 33, SE = 0. 09, p<0. 001 )

. Our data caution against explaining audiology-typical listening performance solely from changes in aspects of neural functioning as listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories. Our results critically inform translational efforts aimed at the preservation and restoring of speech comprehension abilities in ageing individuals.

., 2015; Mesgarani and Chang, 2012 ). As participants performed a challenging dual-talker listening task, we recorded their electroencephalogram ( EEG ). We observed that enhanced neural filtering—defined as stronger neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech—led to more accurate and overall faster responses. Notably, we observed both neural filtering as well as its link to behaviour to be independent of chronological age and severity of hearing loss ( Tune et al

. However, the potency of neural markers to predict future behavioural outcomes is often only implicitly assumed but seldom put to the test ( Woo et al., 2017 ). Using auditory cognition as a model system, we here aim to overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success

    The study investigated the relationship between age-related loss of sensory acuity and preserved attentional neural filtering in ageing individuals. The results showed that despite expected decline in hearing threshold sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. Neural filtering and behaviour were correlated within each measurement point but not longitudinally. Longitudinal results caution against attention-guided neural metrics as predictors of individual change in listening behaviour, as neither filtering at T1 nor 2-year change predicted 2-year change in behaviour under combination modelling. 

The study characterised hearing acuity, neural, filtering, and performance across middle to older lifespan and analysed change from T1 to T2 using linear mixed models. Results showed no evidence for predictive role of filtering despite brain-behaviour links within time. Behavioural outcome of interest, speed and accuracy, involves perceptual and cognitive processes. Results support role of attention-guided neural as read of individual attentional state but state nature of tracking metrics limits translational potential. 

Individuals differ in level of filtering and behaviour from other individuals at same time and own time. Trajectories of listening cannot be explained by change along single dimension. Better understanding will rely on uncovering contribution and dynamics of sensory, neural, and factors. 

Ageing and loss cannot account for interindividual differences in behaviour and change. Research focused on neurobi mechanisms promoting comprehension by segregating behaviour relevant sounds. Predicting change from baseline or longitudinal brain function is non-trivial. Connecting trajectories goes beyond domain-specific trends. 

Age associated with poorer hearing and listening performance. Cross-sectional and longitudinal probed role of filtering as precursor behavioural change. Individual T1 filtering did not predict longitudinal change and 2-year change in filtering did not explain change behaviour. Data part of large longitudinal study on neural and cognitive supporting listening in middle-aged adults. 

Models tested cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in sensory, filtering, and performance. Age, time, and interaction as effectors allowed participant intercepts. Individuals may rely alternative strategies. Understanding interindividual in behaviour ageing will depend on different factors, attention-modulated speech constitutes necessary but not sufficient correlate.
Researchers investigated the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis, in the use of botanical drugs in ancient Greece and Rome. They hypothesized that chemosensation and physiological effects mediated by chemestesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of drugs in ancient times. To test this, they used a tasting panel to determine the intensity and complexity of chemos sensory qualities and tastes of 700 botanicals and applied phylogenetic general linear models to predict their therapeutic uses. They found chemos to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with versatile drugs having simple tastes and intense chemos qualities, and 22 chemos qualities predicting at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy tastes were associated with versatility. The study suggests that ancient uses of drugs were based on observed effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesis and taste pharmacology. The theory of humors, underlying Western medicine from ancient to industrial times, is discredited, but the study proposes a link to modern medicine through taste and flavor of botanicals.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

   . Along with the data showing the WT attraction to serum is diminished with serine racemase treatment, these results support that the mechanism of Tsr-mediated chemoattraction to serum is through direct recognition of L-serine. The robust serum attraction response conserved across diverse Salmonella serovars suggests serum, and L-serine present in serum, could be a source of nutrients during infection

. Our chemotaxis experiments with the tsr strain show that while Tsr is not the only chemoreceptor involved in taxis to serum for S. enterica, it does play an important role through chemoattraction to the high concentration of L-serine within serum. We hypothesized that attraction to serum, mediated through Tsr, might extend beyond S. enterica to other bacterial species

. This leads us to believe that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth advantages. We next undertook structural studies to understand the specific recognition of L-serine by Tsr

. enterica serovars, E. coli, and C. koseri ) and serum from different animals ( human, horse, and pig ), all WT strains examined share the behavior of rapid taxis toward serum. As a preliminary investigation into whether serum taxis is involved in bacterial pathogenesis, we developed an enterohemorrhagic lesion model to investigate if chemotaxis and Tsr can mediate bloodstream entry. Because swine share many aspects of human gastrointestinal physiology ( Meurens et al

We show here that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid; the motile population reorganizes within 1–2 min of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source ( Figures 2 and 8 ). Serum taxis occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli within serum, one of these being the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine ( Figure 4 )

. Nevertheless, taxis to serum appears to be a behavior shared by diverse Enterobacteriaceae species and perhaps also Gammaproteobacteria priority pathogen genera that possess Tsr such as Serratia, Providencia, Morganella, and Proteus ( Figure 8B ). So far, our focus has been on bacterial taxis toward human serum. However, given the presence of L-serine in the serum of various animal species, we were interested in exploring if serum from other mammals could also attract bacteria

., 2019; Xu and Lu, 2020 ). Consequently, how enteric pathogens and pathobionts might respond to serum diffusing into a liquid environment remained unclear. To address this open question, we elucidated how Enterobacteriaceae species use chemosensing to respond to serum, the molecular mechanism of this response, and how chemosensing is employed to enter and migrate into enterohemorrhagic lesions

. enterica to other bacterial species. The biological distribution of Tsr chemoreceptors has not been previously characterized, so we applied our structural insights to define a motif consisting of the amino acids involved in L-serine recognition. When we analyzed the genomes of Enterobacteriaceae genera such as Escherichia, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter, we found their Tsr orthologues to possess this motif ( Figure 8A )

., 2020 ). A notable characteristic of the DSS-colitis model is intestinal bleeding ( Kim et al., 2012 ), suggesting that the enrichment of amino acids, including serine, could be attributed to the leakage of host metabolites from serum. The ability of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae to exploit growth advantages from L-serine during colitis may be linked to their highly sensitive and rapid chemoattraction to this effector emitted from human serum

. We discovered that many WHO priority pathogens are among the species that have Tsr, leading us to suspect these pathogens and pathobionts also perform serum taxis. To address this question, we performed CIRA analyses with human serum and the bacterial strains E. coli MG1655 and C. koseri BAA-895, the latter being a clinical isolate with previously uncharacterized chemotactic behavior

. We find that both these strains exhibit attraction to human serum on time scales and magnitudes similar to experiments with Salmonella ( Figure 8C–E, Videos 8 and 9 ). Without further genetic analyses in these strain backgrounds, the evidence for Tsr mediating serum taxis for these bacteria remains circumstantial

. Our structural and molecular investigations into S. enterica Tsr affirm its role as a serine sensor, revealing a highly optimized and selective ligand-binding site for the recognition of L-serine ( Figure 7, Video 7 ). Although the host-derived metabolites NE and DHMA have been reported to be chemoattractants for E. coli sensed directly through Tsr, we were unable to corroborate these results in S

. From this database of Tsr sequences, we were able to visualize the distribution of Tsr orthologues across biology, which strikingly are enriched among Enterobacteriaceae, but are also present in several other families that include WHO priority pathogens ( Figure 8B, Supplementary file 2 ). This analysis confirms that the bacterial species most commonly associated with bacteremia in patients with IBD possess the Tsr chemoreceptor ( Figure 8B, Supplementary file 2; Goren et al., 2020 )

., 2008 ). Enteric Peyer’s patches are primary invasion sites for non-typhoidal Salmonella, and these structures are situated close to vasculature that can be damaged through the pathogen’s destruction of microfold ( M ) cells, causing localized bleeding ( Shi et al., 2012 ). S. enterica Typhimurium uses the chemoreceptor Tsr to locate and invade Peyer’s patches ( Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016 ), which could involve L-serine chemoattraction originating from serum or necrotic cells

. enterica clinical isolates or various serovars. To establish whether L-serine sensing is observed in strains responsible for human infections, we used dual-channel CIRA to compare chemoattraction to L-serine between S. Typhimurium IR715 and clinical isolates ( Figure 5A–C, Video 4 ). In each case, we observe robust chemoattraction, though there are differences in sensitivity to L-serine. The magnitude of chemoattraction was highest for S. Typhimurium SARA1 and S. Newport, whereas S

., 2020; Goren et al., 2020 ). Intestinal intra-abdominal abscesses, microperforations, and fistulas associated with IBD predispose patients to GI bleeding and bacteremia ( Satoh et al., 2020; Vohra et al., 2020 ). Despite the established connection between Enterobacteriaceae-induced sepsis and GI bleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through chemosensing

To model features of enteric bleeding in vitro, we utilized an experimental system to inject minute quantities of human serum into a pond of motile bacteria and observe real-time responses by microscopy ( Figure 2A )

. These results align with our other data indicating that serum taxis requires CheY, and that Tsr contributes, but is not the only chemoreceptor involved in mediating attraction. Additional investigation is required to confirm the occurrence of these behaviors during infection, but it seems plausible that bacterial taxis toward sources of serum in the host gut environment occurs, potentially contributing to the development of bacteremia.

. While Tsr is known as a bacterial sensor of L-serine ( Zhou et al., 2020 ), its role in chemotaxis to serum has not been previously described. Our data indicate that T is a key chemore in serum recognition of L-ser, which is abundant in human serum ( Figure 4, Video 3 ). The structure of T in complex with L-ser ( Figure 7, Video 7 ) reveals a conserved amino acid motif for L-ser recognition among Tsr orthologues ( Figure 8A ). This motif is shared among Enterobacteraceae, including E. coli, C. koser, and Enterobacter ( Figure 8 ) and also present in other Gammaprotebacteria such as Serrat, Provid, Morganella, and Proteus ( Figure 8B ) that possess Tsr

The structure of T in complex with L-ser ( Figure 7, Video 7 ) shows a highly selective and optimized ligand-binding site for the recognition of L-ser ( Figure 7, Video 7 ). This is consistent with T being a key chemore for L-ser in Enterobacteraceae, including S. enterica, E. coli, C koser, and Enterob ( Figure 8 ) and Gammaprotebacteria such as Serrat, Provid, Morganella, and Prote ( Figure 8 ) that possess Tsr. The structure of T in complex with L ( Figure 7, Video 7 ) reveals a conserved amino acid motif for L-ser recognition among T orthologues ( Figure 8 ) shared among Enterobacter, E coli, C, koser, and Enter ( Figure 8 ) and Gammapbacteria such as Serrat, Provid, Morgan, and Prote ( Figure 8 ) that possess T

The structure of T in complex with L ( Figure 7, Video 7 ) shows a conserved amino acid motif for L-ser recognition among T ortholog ( Figure 8 ) shared among Enterobacter, coli, C, koser, and ( Figure 8 ) and Gamrotebacteria such as Serrat, Provid, Morgan, and Prote ( Figure 8 ) that possess T.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

   . By functionally interfering with 920 deeply conserved genes associated with male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes required for a broad range of germ cell functions, as well as three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. We propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact

In summary, we have identified a conserved male germ cell gene expression program, spanning more than 600 million years of evolution, that can provide clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, the majority of which are deeply conserved

. Based on these analyses, we conclude that despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and a preferential birthplace for new genes, deeply conserved genes remain central components in the male germ cell transcriptome of evolutionarily distant species. Accordingly, we decided to explore this increased connectivity as a means of gaining insight into the conserved molecular basis of metazoan spermatogenesis

., 2012 ). Collectively, we observed that, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, the male germ cell transcriptome has an old evolutionary origin that is tempered by the increased expression of younger genes at later developmental stages. Our data, indicative of a core spermatogenic program spanning more than 600 million years of evolution, significantly expand the breadth of previous observations in the mammalian lineage ( Lau et al., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al

., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al., 2023 ). This led us to explore the possibility that, despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes, the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. To test this hypothesis, we devised an interdisciplinary research platform based on four combined approaches ( Figure 1a )

. These observations may provide a unifying genetic basis for the deep conservation of fundamental germ cell biological processes such as sperm motility and gamete fusion ( Speer et al., 2021; Moi et al., 2022 ). The existence of a shared genetic identity in metazoan spermatocytes can be regarded as a ramification of an ancestral multipotency program already present in germ line precursor cells ( Fierro-Constaín et al., 2017 )

. First, we determined, through comparison of genome sequences, the age of the gene expression program of male germ cells from three evolutionarily distant metazoan species: humans ( Homo sapiens ), mice ( Mus musculus ), and fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ). Then, we used network science to infer the significance of deeply conserved genes within the context of the complex male germ line transcriptome

., 2021 ). By focusing on the deep evolutionary past of human spermatogenesis, we have identified 79 functional interactions that likely represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of male germ cells, and 179 novel functionally validated candidate genes. Exploring to what extent these core functional interactions reflect direct protein-protein contacts is an important area for future research

. Accordingly, these 161 new deeply conserved spermatogenesis genes ( homologous to 179 and 187 in humans and mice, respectively ) represent both a significant advance in our understanding of the genetic basis of male germ cell development, and a valuable resource to explore from a precision medicine perspective. To facilitate open access to this information, we made all data available in the form of a user-friendly gene browser ( https://pages. igc. pt/meionav; Figure 2j )

. Of the 61 genes, 27 had already been linked to male germ cell defects in different species: four were clinically validated male infertility genes ( CDC14A, CFAP91, DNAI1 and DNAI2 ), and the other 23 had been previously reported in animal models ( see Materials and methods ). The fact that among the latter was BOLL, one of the oldest known metazoan gametogenesis genes ( Shah et al., 2010 ), was a particularly noteworthy observation

. Indeed, despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and frequent birthplace of genetic novelty, deeply conserved genes are central components of the male germ cell transcriptome, with younger genes being preferentially expressed in late spermatogenesis

. Subsequently, through developmental biology ( in vivo RNAi in fruit fly testes ), we defined the role of a key subset of the conserved germ cell transcriptome in male reproductive fitness. Finally, we merged this information with clinical genetics to identify new potential causes of human infertility. Overall, we show that deeply conserved genes play a prominent role in male germ cell regulation and that the disruption of this ancient genetic program leads to human reproductive disease

., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al., 2023 ), while emphasizing the potential relevance of using conserved expression between distant animal species to gain insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. We next addressed the possible significance of the abundant expression of deeply conserved genes in the male germ line. For this, we focused on meiosis, a fundamental process conserved through eukaryotes

. Based on the above, we conclude that the RNF113 genes have retained a key role in spermatogenesis for more than 600 million years of evolution. Furthermore, they provided us the means to interfere with a sizable fraction of the male germ cell orthoBackbone in humans and fruit flies – an advantage we next explored from a clinical perspective. Male infertility is a complex human disease with a poorly defined genetic component

., 2019 ). Based on its conservation in the orthoBackbone of evolutionarily distant species and on the significant spermatogenic role of the intervening genes, we posit that this subnetwork of 79 functional interactions involving 104 genes likely represents a core component of the conserved genetic program of spermatogenesis

. Since the latter represents a still sizeable interaction subnetwork consisting of more than 3, 000 genes, we decided to select candidate genes likely to affect the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity. For this, we again took into account how the mitosis-to-meiosis transcriptional burst activates the expression of spermatogenesis genes – a process that has been likened to that of cellular reprogramming ( Guo et al., 2018; Alavattam et al., 2019 )

. Despite the rapid divergence typically associated with reproduction-related genes, we found that the majority ( 65. 2 to 70. 3% ) of genes expressed in male germ cells mapped to the oldest-ranking phylostrata containing orthogroups common to all Metazoa, henceforth referred to as deeply conserved genes ( Figure 1d )

. Such a number brings a significant but largely overlooked functional constraint to the general notion that almost all protein-coding genes are transcribed in the male germ line. We next assessed the contribution of deeply conserved genes to the male germ cell transcriptome

., 2014; Fitzpatrick et al., 2022 ). At the molecular level, this variation can be mainly traced back to rapid evolutionary changes in gene expression in the testis ( Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019 ) – likely facilitated by widespread transcriptional leakage in male germ cells ( Soumillon et al., 2013 ) – and to the preferential emergence of new genes in this organ ( Kaessmann, 2010 ), where they often acquire functions in spermatogenesis ( Kondo et al., 2017 )

. To narrow the gap, we explored the possibility that spermatogenesis is particularly sensitive to disturbances in the male germ cell orthoBackbone. Thus, we harnessed the sizeable effect of RNF113B on this network as a means of identifying additional genetic causes of human infertility. Indeed, we noted that 38

The study of male germ cells across different species has revealed a conserved genetic program that defines their identity. Despite the rapid evolution of reproductive genes, deeply conserved genes remain central in the male cell transcriptome. The researchers analyzed the spermat transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species and found that approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes are required for metazoan male cells, with a third being deeply conserved. A network of 79 interactions between 104 gene regulators represents a core of the conserved program. Interfering with the acquisition of male cell identity uncovered 161 unknown sperogenesis genes and potential causes of human infertility. The study emphasizes the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establishes a cross-species pipeline for other pathologies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination. The model organism for studying flagellate motility, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, employs synchronous, breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In C. reinhardtii, the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella; however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency, waveform, etc. ) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. 

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2016; Pellicciotta et al., 2020 ). Dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardtii’s tactic motility ( Kamiya and Witman, 1984; Horst and Witman, 1993; Pazour et al., 2005; Okita et al., 2005 ). Calcium has long been speculated to facilitates such dynamic modulation ( Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Wan et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2021 ) because it is involved in switching the beating mode ( Hayashi et al

. Hereafter, we refer to the synchronization of the flagellar beating with the imposed external flow as ‘flow entrainment’, in order to avoid confusion with the ‘synchronization’ between the cis and the trans flagella. In our experiments, the cis and trans flagella always beat synchronously, therefore flow entrainment always takes place for both flagella simultaneously, regardless of the flow’s direction

. These observations definitively prove that the two flagella have differential roles in the coordination and interestingly imply that flagella are coupled to external flow only through the cis. To elucidate the mechanisms at the origin of this asymmetry, we develop a reduced stochastic model for the system, see Equation 2. In the model, selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating are respectively represented by ϵc≠ϵt and λct≠λtc

. Intriguingly, when connected by basal fibers and beating synchronously, they both adopt the kinematics of the cis- ( eyespot ) flagellum, which led to the assumption that the flagella may have differential roles in coordination. In this work, we test this hypothesis by employing oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells’ symmetry axis and thus exert biased loads on one flagellum

. Using this model, we express f and ε, which we can measure experimentally ( Equation 3 ), as a function of fc, t, ϵc, t, λct and λtc to illustrate how the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating. Moreover, with Monte-Carlo simulations, we clarify the interplay between flows and flagella ( Appendix 1: Monte-Carlo simulations ), and reproduce all experimental observations

., 1998 ) and in tuning flagellar beating amplitude ( Kamiya and Witman, 1984; Okita et al., 2005 ), and calcium influx comprises the initial step of the cell’s photo- ( Harz and Hegemann, 1991 ) and mechanoresponses ( Yoshimura, 2011 ). We therefore investigate flagellar coupling in the context of tactic steering by depleting the environmental free calcium and hence inhibiting signals of calcium influxes

The two flagella of C. reinhardtii have long been known to have inherently different dynamic properties such as frequency, waveform, level of active noise, and responses to second messengers ( Kamiya and Hasegawa, 1987; Okita et al., 2005; Leptos et al., 2013; Wan, 2018; Saegusa and Yoshimura, 2015 )

. Computations begin with the onset of the background flows ( notified experimentally by a flashlight event ), and last for ~30 beats ( 500 frames sampled at 801 fps ). Additionally, we confirm the results of trans-flow-entrainment, that both flagella spend large fractions of time beating against the flows, with other cells and with trans-flows at other frequencies

. Our computations provide the loads on the flagella throughout the entire experiment, from the time the captured cell is gradually entrained by the external flow, see Appendix 1: Hydrodynamic computation for asymmetric loading for the entire time series. Figure 1E, F, G represent the loads on each flagellum for flows with θ = 45°, 90°, 135°, after the cell is fully entrained

We set out to establish a non-invasive experimental technique that exerts differential loads on the flagella of C. reinhardtii. Following Quaranta et al., 2015, we use external background flows to exert hydrodynamic forcing on captured cells. Hydrodynamic forces are generated by a relative motion between the captured cell and its surrounding fluid

. In contrast to the speculation that calcium is involved in the dynamic modulation of ciliary dominance in synchronous beating ( Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Wan et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2021 ), our results indicate that the leading role of cis ( i. e., λct≫λtc ) is an inherent property, which does not require active influx of external calcium, and possibly reflects an intrinsic mechanical asymmetry of the cellular mesh that anchors the two flagella into the cell body

. In all our experiments with wt cells, we robustly observe that cis-flows, the ones that selectively load the cis flagellum, are always more effective in entraining the flagellar beating than the trans-flows. This is shown by the larger effective forcing strengths ( ε ( cis-flow ) >ε ( trans-flow ), Figure 3B ) and larger entrained time fractions ( τ ( cis-flow ) >τ ( trans-flow ), Figure 3C )

. e., λ=3|ft−fc|, to account for the fact that: ( 1 ) the coordinated beating is approximated in-phase, and ( 2 ) up until the strongest flow applied, the inter-flagellar synchronization cannot be broken ( quantitative evaluation is detailed in Appendix 1: Monte-Carlo simulations ). To model wt cells under calcium depletion, we decrease ϵc+ϵt by 15% - which is the mean decrease in the observed ε ( cis-flow ), ε ( frontal-flow ), and ε ( trans-flow ) ( Figure 3E )

. Exploiting the observation that the coordination between flagella cannot be broken by external flows up to the strongest ones tested ( εmax∼10 Hz, Figure 2B ), we quantify the lower limit of the total basal coupling, λct+λtc, to be approximately 40 Hz ( deduced in Appendix 1: Monte-Carlo simulations ), which is an order magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic inter-flagellar coupling ( Quaranta et al., 2015; Brumley et al., 2014; Klindt et al., 2016; Pellicciotta et al., 2020 )

., 2008 ), see Figure 1D. In all our experimental recordings, the cis and the trans flagella beat synchronously. Typical phase locking between them is represented in Figure 1D inset, where the phase difference Δ=ϕc−ϕt fluctuates around 0. Therefore, ϕc and ϕt are equal and denoted as ϕ. The response of the flagella to the external hydrodynamic loads is therefore characterized by the difference between the flagellar phase ϕ ( t ) and the phase of the oscillating flow ϕ0=2πf0t

. In ptx1 cells, a lack of flagellar dominance ( λct=λtc ) and a stronger noise level are necessary to reproduce our experimental observations. Previous studies suggested that both flagella of ptx1 are similar to the wildtype trans ( Horst and Witman, 1993; Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Okita et al., 2005 ), and that the noise levels of this mutant’s synchronous beating are much greater than those of wt ( Leptos et al

. Differential external loads are selectively exerted on the cis- and the trans-flagellum by imposing oscillatory background flows at an angle with respect to the cell’s symmetry axis. We use numerical simulations to quantify the differential loads exerted by flows along different angles θ = 45°, 90, 135. The results are shown in Figure 1E, F, G, which represent the loads on each flagell for θ = 45, 90, 135 after the cell is fully entrained by the flow

The flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii employ synchronous flagellar beating to swim and modulate the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. response to chemical messengers ) and asymmet being effectively coordinated in synchronous.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.

Here, we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. Further, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity ( DIO ) mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced the beigeing of white adipose tissue

. Second, a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis. The role of ILC3s in metabolism remains largely unknown. Our studies provide evidence supporting the metabolic benefit of intestinal ILC3s in intermittent fasting

. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. Our study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis is actively involved in the regulation of adipose tissue beigeing. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue.

Our present study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. This conclusion is supported by following observations. First, intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in either lean mice fed NCD, obese mice fed HFD, or mice with metabolic dysfunction induced by HFCD diet

. These observations indicate that IL-22R mediates the effect of intestinal ILC3s on beigeing of white adipocytes. To explore the mechanism by which intermittent fasting promotes the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s, live CD45+ lineage ( CD3, CD5, B220, CD19, Gr1 ) - cells isolated from the siLP of mice fed NCD, HFD, or HFD-IF were subjected for single-cell sequencing ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A )

. Our studies identify ILC3s-IL-22-IL-22R as a novel pathway mediating the crosstalk between intestine and adipose tissue. Evidence supporting this conclusion are five folds. ( 1 ) Intermittent fasting reverses the reduction of intestinal ILC3s and IL-22 in DIO mice. ( 2 ) Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s enhances beigeing of white adipose tissue. ( 3 ) Co-culture of intestinal ILC3s with SVF cells increases their differentiation into beige cells

. However, significant increase in proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s was induced by intermittent fasting for 2 days whereas total percentile of ILC3s remained unaltered ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4C ). These results indicate that the beiging of white adipose tissue are subsequent to its effect on ILC3s secreting IL-22. Next, we examined whether adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s can increase beigeing of white adipose tissue in DIO mice

. Further, the decrement of plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) as well as IL-22 positive ILCs in intestine ( Figure 1K ) was attenuated by 30 days’ intermittent fasting. In order to explain the chronological relationship between ILC3s secreting IL-22 and beigeing of white adipose tissue, the mice were exposed to one cycle of intermittent fasting for 2 days. At this time, the body weight of mice didn’t change and beige adipocytes haven’t been induced ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B )

. To explore whether gut immune system contributes to the effects of intermittent fasting on white adipose tissue beigeing, we examined levels of various cytokines in intestine. Notably, mRNA level of Il22 in the NCD-IF group was significantly higher relevant to the control group ( Figure 1B ). Consistently, plasma concentration of IL-22 detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was also increased ( Figure 1C )

. SVF cells lacking IL-22R demonstrate no response to the upregulation of thermogenic genes induced by intestinal ILC3. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the concept that intestinal ILC3s modulate beigeing of adipose tissue via IL-22-IL-22R pathway. The physiological mechanism underlying the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s remains largely unknown. Our studies reveal the distinct secretion pattern of IL-22 induced by intermittent fasting

. IL-22 promotes beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22R. Intestinal ILC3s thus may serve as a potential target for the intervention of metabolic disorders.

. To further explore whether IL-22R mediates the effect of ILC3s on beigeing of adipocytes, intestinal ILC3s isolated from intermittent fasting mice were co-cultured with beige adipocytes from subcutaneous SVF of WT or IL-22RKO mice ( Figure 5I and J ). Co-culture with ILC3s significantly increased the mRNA levels of thermogenic genes in beige adipocytes derived from WT mice, while demonstrating no effect on beige adipocytes derived from IL-22RKO mice ( Figure 5K )

. Besides, intermittent fasting didn’t alter the levels of ILC3s and IL-22 in mouse adipose tissue ( Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Similar to NCD mice, intermittent fasting significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-22 in the intestine of HFD mice while didn’t influence the secretion of IL-22 by T cells ( Figure 1H and I ). Furthermore, mice fed HFD showed an obvious reduction in the plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) and percentage of total and IL-22 positive ILC3s ( Figure 1K )

. To explore whether IL-22R mediates the effect of intermittent fasting on the beigeing of white adipose tissue, IL-22R knockout ( IL-22RKO ) mice and wild-type ( WT ) littermates were subjected to alternate day fasting diet for 30 days. Rectal temperature of WT-IF and IL-22RKO-IF mice was monitored during 2 consecutive days of intermittent fasting

. In addition to directly promoting the beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22, intestinal ILC3s may enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier ( Ibiza et al., 2016 ), reducing serum LPS and peptidoglycan, thus reducing the inhibitory effect of LPS and peptidoglycan on the beigeing of white adipose tissue ( Chen et al., 2022 ). O’Sullivan et al., 2016, have reported that ILC3s are negligible in white adipose tissue of either lean or obese mice. Similarly, Sasaki et al

., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2021b ). However, the contribution of ILC3s on adipocytes and obesity are less clear. ILC3s can produce interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) in response to extracellular bacteria and fungi ( Sanos et al., 2009 ). ILC3s-derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function, reduce endotoxemia and inflammation, ameliorate insulin sensitivity ( Wang et al., 2014; Hasnain et al

. ( 4 ) Exogenous IL-22 mimics the effect of intermittent fasting on beigeing of white adipose tissue. ( 5 ) Deficiency of IL-22R blocks the IF-induced beigeing of white adipose tissue. In lines with our observation, a series of recent studies have suggested that cytokines can act directly on adipocytes to regulate thermogenesis. For example, γδ T cells regulate heat production by secreting IL-17 ( Hu et al., 2020 )

. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice, including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of ILCs isolated from obese mice didn’t improve the metabolic functions of DIO mice, indicating that ILCs from lean mice are more effective in promoting beige of white adipose.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.

   ., 2023; Biddle and Knox, 2023 ). Using the SCS flight conditioning paradigm, we elicit a robust continuum of consistent associative defensive responses during CS presentation that are seldom observed within classical Pavlovian conditioning. While behaviors like darting and tail ratting can occur due to non-associative stimulus-inherent properties, transitions between freezing and jumping are robustly present when associative factors signal threat imminence

. Therefore, these associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct behavioral transitions between freezing and flight. During conditioning, we observed distinct ethograms for the PA and UN groups in response to the SCS. Freezing to tone and activity to WN were both significantly higher in the PA group compared to the UN group ( Figure 2E and K ), highlighting the impact of SCS-shock contingency on the magnitude of defensive responses

., 2019; Trott et al., 2022 ). In addition, sensitization and stimulus salience are known to intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli ( Kamprath and Wotjak, 2004 ), and mice show increased reactivity to a WN stimulus after experiencing stress ( Hoffman et al., 2022 ). These findings highlight the need to better elucidate the associative and non-associative elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning that influence the expression of defensive behavior

., 2024 ) and darting ( Gruene et al., 2015 ) are measured less often within conditioning, limiting insight into defensive response dynamics. To address this critical need, we developed a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli ( Fadok et al., 2017; Borkar et al., 2020; Borkar and Fadok, 2021; Borkar et al., 2024 ), findings that have been replicated by others in both mice and rats ( Dong et al

., 2017; Bouton et al., 2021 ). In standard Pavlovian conditioning paradigms, freezing is the dominant defensive behavior evoked by contexts and learned cues that are paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ), like footshock ( Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969; Bolles and Collier, 1976 ). Other defensive responses like escape jumping ( Chu et al., 2024 ) and darting ( Gruene et al

This study investigated the contributions of associative and non-associative processes to the expression of cue-induced defensive behaviors. The results signify that associative pairings and a proximal stimulus-threat association during fear conditioning produce maximal expression of cue-induced freezing and flight responses

. Non-associative elements such as cue salience, change in stimulus intensity, and shock-induced sensitization elicit stress-associated behaviors like tail rattling and activity bursts, as hypothesized before ( Trott et al., 2022 ), but the addition of the WN-threat associative pairing contributes significantly to eliciting high-intensity defensive responses like escape jumping

Defensive responses have evolved to maximize survival ( Anderson and Adolphs, 2014 ), and animals rapidly switch behaviors depending on threat imminence, the context of exposure, and previous experience with stimuli ( Perusini and Fanselow, 2015 )

. Overall, darting behaviors during conditioning contribute to the higher activity score observed during WN in the PA group, and our data suggests that these contributions are the result of associative learning and threat imminence, rather than non-associative stimulus salience. During extinction, the PA and PA-R groups showed the highest level of freezing to tone compared to the non-associative control groups ( Figure 5A and B )

. Interestingly, while pairing either order of SCS with shock resulted in greater freezing during tone, we observed a phenotype more resistant to extinction within the PA-R group. These data indicate that the extinction of cue-induced freezing in the conditioned flight paradigm depends on its proximity to conditioned threat. Activity indices were calculated to analyze the effect of extinction learning on behavioral responses during the WN

. Altering the contingency between WN and shock in the unpaired or reversed SCS conditions profoundly reduced these defensive behaviors, but the increased activity in all groups during WN suggests that inherent properties of the WN interact with non-associative processes to induce locomotor responses. This is reflected in the increased distance traveled during WN in all groups compared to the tone period

. To address this, we utilized four control groups for the non-associative effects of conditioning. To test the importance of the SCS-shock contingency, we utilized an unpaired control procedure in which the US and the SCS were presented in a separated, pseudorandom, and non-predictive fashion ( Rescorla, 1967 ). To test the effects of sensitization by the shock, we presented footshock alone during conditioning

., 2019; Totty et al., 2021 ). In this paradigm, mice are conditioned with a SCS consisting of a pure tone followed by WN, which terminates with a strong electrical footshock. After conditioning, mice exhibit contextual freezing which significantly increases in response to tone, and mice switch to robust flight responses upon WN presentation

. Current studies are investigating behaviors beyond freezing within classical Pavlovian conditioning paradigms ( Tryon et al., 2021; Laine et al., 2022 ), but responses like jumping and darting are not always reliably elicited during CS presentation ( Colon et al., 2018; Akmese et al., 2023; Biddle and Knox, 2023 )

. This likely reflects a larger perceived psychological distance from threat that influences defensive strategy ( Perusini and Fanselow, 2015 ). The control groups showed only slight changes in WN-evoked activity over extinction, similar to responses of stressed mice to an unfamiliar WN ( Figure 4; Hoffman et al., 2022 )

. Behavioral data from the PA, UN, PA-R, and UN-R groups during the second day of fear conditioning ( CD2 ) were compared to observe how conditioned defensive behavior differs based on the associative value and stimulus order of the SCS. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of trial and group on freezing during the tone and WN. There was no statistically significant interaction between the trial and group for tone-induced freezing ( Figure 2A; F ( 12, 340 ) =0. 65, p=0

. 33; PA mean ± SEM = 12. 54±2. 73 ). Overall, these data show that the respective changes in defensive behavior during tone and WN were significantly affected by the explicit pairing of SCS and shock during fear conditioning, and that the order of tone and WN presentation influenced the intensity of WN-evoked responses

. Indeed, darting behavior has been shown to change based on multiple parameters, decreasing both with increased shock intensity ( Mitchell et al., 2022 ) and with prolonged extinction training ( Demars et al., 2022 ), suggesting that darting is both an associative conditioned response to stimuli associated with threat and a response resulting from non-associative sensitization

. Interestingly, tone-evoked freezing in the PA group underwent within-session extinction, while that of the PA-R group was resistant to extinction ( Figure 5A–D ). The sustained tone-evoked freezing over multiple extinction sessions in the PA-R group is likely a product of the temporal proximity of the cue to the footshock, which is set at a greater intensity ( 0. 9 mA ) in the conditioned flight paradigm than is traditionally used in Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigms ( Blanchard and Blanchard,196; Bolles and Collier,197 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

   . The position integrating neurons in these insects are also predicted to have sinusoidal activation patterns ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Vickerstaff and Di Paolo, 2005; Stone et al., 2017 ). Finally, another interesting avenue for future work is to compare the encoding of direction in insects with that of mammals, which encode heading in a fundamentally different way that uses many more neurons

. Electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies have shown that the neural population encoding the head direction in insects has a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern ( Labhart, 1988; Labhart, 2000; Loesel and Homberg, 2001; Pfeiffer et al., 2005; Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2007; Kinoshita et al., 2007; Heinze et al., 2009; Homberg et al., 2011; El Jundi et al., 2014; El Jundi et al., 2019 )

. Heading integration circuits in insects have been extensively studied, with models ranging in complexity from simplified conceptual networks ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Cope et al., 2017 ) to sophisticated models constrained by biological data and featuring multiple neuron types ( Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017; Su et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Pisokas et al., 2020; Lyu et al., 2022 )

., 2020; Lyu et al., 2022 ). Previous theoretical work has argued that a sinusoidal activity encoding is such a common motif in insect navigation because it facilitates elementwise vector addition ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995 ). However, this cannot be the only reason because as we show there is a whole family of circuits with different encoding patterns that enable easy vector addition

. We compare our predicted circuit with connectivity data for the desert locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) and fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) using network analysis tools, showing a strong agreement. We then ask how an insect brain might develop such a circuit, finding that a simple Hebbian learning rule is sufficient

We consider a population of N ‘compass neurons’ with an activity that encodes the direction of the insect as an angular variable θ. We represent the activity of this population by a vector where each element corresponds to the activity of one neuron, a ( θ ) =[a1 ( θ ), a2 ( θ ),..., aN ( θ ) ]. We take N=8 neurons, consistent with data from many insect species which possess an eight-column organisation, with each column encoding a different direction ( Honkanen et al

., 2022 ). Here, we show that enabling easy vector addition cannot be the unique driving factor for the presence of sinusoidal heading encodings, as many other circuits with different activity patterns can perform vector addition in the same way. This finding led us to question whether the sinusoidal activation patterns seen in insect navigation circuits are a coincidence, or if they might offer a particular functional advantage that was selected for during evolution

. To address this question, we consider the basic principles necessary for a circuit encoding direction. Of all the circuits fulfilling these requirements, the sinusoidal activity pattern offers the best resilience to noise for the encoded information. However, obtaining this activity requires a circuit with a specific connectivity pattern between neurons. Thus, our theory predicts that the heading integration circuit will have a sinusoidal connectivity pattern

In this work we derived an optimal noise-minimising circuit for encoding heading and verified that this circuit matches experimental data from insects. Furthermore, we showed that such a circuit can be developed and maintained by a biological learning rule, and proposed a mathematical argument for the eight-column structure found in insect compass circuits. In this section, we discuss the implications and limitations of these contributions, and outline potential future work

. We find that the connectivity profile between neurons for the locust is very close to sinusoidal in shape, supporting our theoretical prediction. For the fruit fly, we used data from Scheffer et al., 2020, which provides synapse counts between pairs of neurons. These synapse counts were used as a proxy for connectivity strength, a view that has been validated in previous experiments ( Liu et al., 2022; Barnes et al., 2022 )

. This raises a critical question: why would the circuit and encoding be different if navigation follows similar principles across species? We speculate that the difference might lie in the type of navigation that the two classes of animals use. Insects often rely on a reference system that is globally anchored to a certain point or phenomenon, whether it is their nests for ants and bees, the sunlight polarisation pattern for locusts, or the milky way for dung beetles

., 2022 ). In contrast to this work, we focus only on the self-sustaining nature of the heading integration circuit in insects and show that our proposed sinusoidal connectivity profile can emerge naturally. Because the weight matrix is circulant, its eigenvalues are equal to the Fourier spectrum of its first row, which we derived to only have one nonzero value, for f=1. The network therefore only has a single eigenvalue and so projects activity into a single dimension

. This is the main prediction of our theory and we sought to validate it using connectivity data from the locust and fruit fly. However, before we can directly compare our model with biological circuits, we must address a number of modelling simplifications: Therefore, we simplified the biological connectivity to produce an equivalent circuit that could be directly compared with our model prediction

., 2022; Barnes et al., 2022 ). After identifying the neurons and connections of interest, we grouped the neurons in eight columns following the logic presented in Pisokas et al., 2020, with detailed methodology explained in section ‘Data preprocessing’. We repeated the path counting analysis for the fruit fly with synapse count data ( Figure 4B ), and found that while the data are noisy, the connectivity profile fits a single sinusoid pattern reasonably well

., 2020; Kriegeskorte and Golan, 2019 ). This simplification will be addressed in section ‘Comparing the predicted circuit with biological data’ where we compare our model with experimental data. As we consider networks with N=8 neurons, consistent with multiple insect species ( Honkanen et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Pisokas et al

. For our analysis we assume that the insect faces all possible directions, and therefore that the neural activity goes around the full circle. We then integrate the weight updates over some long period of time, ( 20 ) ΔWn, m=∫dWn, mdtdt=∫dWn, mdt ( dθdt ) −1dθ=η∫θ=02π[am ( θ ) an ( θ ) −an ( θ ) 2Wn, m]dθ, where θ is the integration space

. We could also investigate circuits that integrate position, not only heading, which would require the activity to have a 2D plane topology instead of a circle. This would be particularly relevant for foraging insects such as bees or ants, whose ability to remember their position with respect to their nest has been the subject of many experimental and computational studies ( Collett, 2019; Wehner and Srinivasan, 2003 )

. Our approach follows from previous research which has shown that simple Hebbian learning rules can lead to the emergence of circular line attractors in large neural populations ( Stringer et al., 2002 ), and that a head direction circuit can emerge from a predictive rule ( Vafidis et al., 2022 )

. Having validated the connectivity of our theoretical circuit by comparing it to experimental data, we ask whether our circuit lends itself to biological development. Specifically, we show that even though our circuit requires precise connection strengths, this connectivity can be developed naturally by a Hebbian learning rule

. The neural population in our theoretical model corresponds to the biological EPG neurons, as these encode the integrated head direction of the insect. The activity of these neurons is sinusoidal as shown by electrophysiology and calcium imaging studies ( Labhart 198; Lab 200; Lo and Hom 2001; Pfe 2005; Pfe 2007; Kin 2007; Hein 2009 Hom 201; El 2014 El 201; 2019 ). Our model predicts that the connectivity between these neurons follows a sinusoidal pattern, which is supported by anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly. We show that such a circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but can develop during development.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

   . In summary, our results suggest that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein Cisd is downstream of the pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink1 and partially Prkn loss of function in flies and probably also in humans. This sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and implicates CISD1 as a therapeutic target protein.

We here identified the mitochondrial protein CISD1, specifically its iron-depleted form, as a potential downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function, and to a certain extent, Parkin loss of function. Our investigation revealed that both dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with PINK1 mutations and Pink1 mutant flies exhibit increased levels of a slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd on immunoblots

. Based on the involvement of mammalian CISD1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control, iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress – all hallmarks of PD – we aimed to investigate CISD1’s role in PD using both fly and mammalian model systems. In our study, we identified CISD1, particularly its iron-depleted apo form, as a downstream mediator of the PD pathology induced by the loss of Pink1 and Prkn function

. Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation and even the presence of a CISD1 multimer under these conditions ( Figure 2D ). Consequently, we conclude that the increased dimer formation in the PINK1 mutant neurons likely represents the presence of apo-CISD1, a form of CISD1 devoid of its iron-sulfur cluster, and that this is caused by changes in the iron homeostasis

. Cisd overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted mitochondrial morphology, and led to an accumulation of phospho-ubiquitin which they speculate also blocks mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of more defective mitochondria ( Martinez et al., 2024 ). All three papers propose distinct mechanisms for the toxic effects of CISD1 in PD. While our study suggests a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation, particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1, Ham et al

., 2020 ). Interestingly, KO of IRP2, a protein highly homologous to IRP1 but lacking aconitase activity, results in iron accumulation and Parkinsonism in mice ( LaVaute et al., 2001 ). An interaction of CISD1 with IRP2 has not been reported so far but appears likely. In summary, these results strongly implicate altered mitochondrial iron homeostasis and redox dysregulation in fly and human models of PD and link it to CISD1 dysfunction

. An important target protein of PINK1/PRKN crucial for iron homeostasis and redox homeostasis is CISD1, also known as mitoNEET ( reviewed in Mittler et al., 2019 ). CISD1 is a homodimeric protein N-terminally inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol ( Wiley et al., 2007a ). CISD1 is ubiquitinated by PRKN ( Sarraf et al., 2013 ) and its levels are reduced upon dissipation of Δψm ( Chan et al., 2011; Cunningham et al., 2015; Lazarou et al

., 1987; Hirsch et al., 1991 ). Notably, this iron dysregulation is apparent even in asymptomatic carriers of PRKN mutations ( Pyatigorskaya et al., 2015 ), suggesting that it is an early event and correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, human dopaminergic neurons lacking PINK1 display inhibition of the iron-dependent mitochondrial aconitase, leading to accumulation of NAD+ and depletion of essential metabolites ( Bus et al., 2020 )

., 2020 ). In flies, Pink1 deficiency similarly results in inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase by impairing its labile iron-sulfur cluster, leading to oxidative distress and mitochondrial swelling ( Esposito et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2020 ). These findings highlight the relevance of iron dysregulation in the PD development and progression

. The accumulation of apo-CISD1/Cisd and the subsequent inability to repair defective IRP1/2 would place CISD1 upstream of the changes in iron homeostasis observed in PD and models of PD ( Ma et al., 2021 ). Our results also suggest that apo-CISD1 exhibits a toxic gain of function possibly independent of the effects on iron homeostasis. Ubiquitous overexpression of Cisd and apo-Cisd in flies aggravated known phenotypes of Pink1 mutation as a reduced climbing ability and lifespan

. In addition, fly Cisd2 ( this publication used the alternative name MitoNEET ) interacts with IRP1 ( Huynh et al., 2019 ) further linking Cisd2 to iron homeostasis. Together these findings suggest that fly Cisd2 rather resembles the human mitochondrial homolog CISD1 and to avoid confusion, we will henceforth use Cisd for the fly ortholog

. We then investigated the effect of complete Cisd depletion on the phenotypes described in mutant Pink1B9 flies including reduced dopamine levels, lifespan, climbing ability, a morphological wing phenotype caused by atrophy of the wing muscles, and an altered mitochondria ultrastructure ( Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006 )

. Apo-CISD1 accumulates in PINK1 patient-derived human dopaminergic neurons and apo-Cisd in mutant Pink1 flies. Complete loss of Cisd rescues all detrimental effects of Pink1 loss of function on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. In Prkn mutant flies, Cisd deficiency ameliorates climbing ability and wing posture impairments, but does not mitigate the reduction in lifespan

., 2014 ). Overexpression of Cisd2 ( this publication used the alternative name Dosmit ) in fly muscles is detrimental and results in mitochondrial enlargement and the formation of double-membraned vesicles containing cytosolic proteins within mitochondria ( Chen et al., 2020 ), implicating Cisd2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Similar to human CISD1, fly Cisd2 is an Fe/S protein and all amino acids linked to cluster coordination are conserved

., 2007b ). This serves to transfer the iron-sulfur cluster to other proteins as part of a cellular adaptive response that helps recovery from oxidative injury ( reviewed in Mittler et al., 2019 ). One protein that can accept the Fe/S cluster from holo-CISD1 is IRP1, as previously demonstrated ( Ferecatu et al., 2014 ). Also in flies, Cisd physically interacts with holo-IRP1, and its deficiency renders flies more susceptible to iron depletion ( Huynh et al

. Having demonstrated that iron dyshomeostasis induced by the iron-depleting agent deferiprone results in increased CISD1 dimer formation in fibroblasts, we next investigated iron dynamics in Pink1 mutant flies compared to controls by employing mass spectrometry. This revealed a heightened total iron content in Pink1 mutants ( Figure 3G )

. Previous work demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of Cisd in muscle decreased the lifespan of flies and resulted in enlarged mitochondria containing numerous intramitochondrial vesicles surrounded by a double membrane ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Our data now indicate that this process might contribute to the pathophysiology resulting from the loss of Pink1/Prkn-mediated mitochondrial quality control

. This revealed that iron depletion also showed a trend toward reduced eclosion of WT flies but nearly completely abrogated the eclosion of Pink1 mutant flies ( Figure 3I ). Collectively, these results support a connection between iron dyshomeasis, CIS1 dimerization, and the pathophysiology of PD.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

   ., 2022 ). Our study further expands the mechanistic understanding about insect gender specific factors targeted by parasites. In our research, we have uncovered a mechanism whereby the phytoplasma effector SAP54 targets a conserved host regulator, SVP, to attract female leafhopper vectors to produce more progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males

. The observation that female leafhoppers prefer to reproduce on both SAP54 and svp mutant plants exclusively in the presence of leafhopper males underscores a sophisticated regulatory effect of SVP and other MADS-box transcription factors targeted by SAP54 on plant responses to the different sexes of the herbivores. This intricate interaction is detailed in the mechanism proposed in Figure 7. Considering that certain phytoplasmas can modify plant volatile production ( Mayer et al

Given our previous finding that SAP54 promotes fecundity of the AY-WB phytoplasma leafhopper vector M. quadrilineatus, we wished to further investigate what aspect of the insect-plant interaction is affected by SAP54. Females feed and lay eggs, while males only feed, and it is known that plants can induce different plant defence responses to insect feeding and egg laying ( Little et al., 2007 )

. As well, SAP54 plants exposed to males display significant downregulation of biotic stress responses. We identified the MADS-box transcription factor SVP to be essential for this female preference to male-exposed SAP54 plants. Leafhopper females exhibited a preference for reproducing on svp null mutant plants, a behavior that is also contingent upon the presence of leafhopper males, and aligning with our observation that SAP54 mediates the degradation of SVP in leaves

. Given that phytoplasmas rely on leafhoppers for acquisition during feeding and subsequent transmission to other plants, SAP54 likely promotes the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitates phytoplasma transmission. This illustrates how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector

. Moreover, plant biotic stress and defence responses are largely suppressed in male ( compared to female ) exposed SAP54 plants, and SVP also displays distinct plant transcriptional responses to male and female leafhoppers. Nevertheless, the mechanisms how male and female leafhoppers, in combination with SAP54, differentially affect plant defence responses will need further investigation. While the differences in male and female behavior may play a role ( Beanland et al

., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2024 ). Leafhoppers prefer plants that stably produce SAP54 for reproduction and this preference phenotype requires the presence of RAD23, which is essential for both breaking down MADS-box transcription factors and inducing leaf-like flowers ( MacLean et al., 2014 ). However, the increased reproduction of insect vectors does not depend on the presence of leaf-like flowers

. Our past research showed that insects prefer SAP54 plants during the vegetative developmental phase, before flowers emerge, and even flowering SAP54 plants upon removal of the leaf-like flowers ( Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016 ). Therefore, it remains unclear whether plant MADS-box transcription factors play a role in the leafhopper attraction phenotype

. Therefore, by characterizing a parasite effector, we revealed the crucial role of SVP in leaf susceptibility to male herbivorous insects, enhancing female attraction and colonization. This work built on our previous findings that the leaf-like flowers are not required for the insect colonization preference and the insect vectors are predominantly attracted to the leaves and not flowers of plants ( Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016 )

. Specifically, multiple genes with roles in abiotic stress, cell wall modification, proteolysis, respiratory burst, secondary metabolism and defence signaling ( MAPKs ) were downregulated in the male-exposed SAP54 leaves. Together these results indicate that SAP54 dramatically alters leaf biotic stress response to leafhoppers, and downregulates the majority of this response in the presence of males

. Our research sheds light on how the conserved MADS-box transcription factor SVP influences leaf susceptibility to male herbivorous insects, promoting female attraction and colonization.

. It is possible that the attraction of insect vectors to leaves is the primary function of SAP54, and the induction of the leaf-like flowers an evolutionary side-effect of SAP54 adaptation to target MTFs that leads to degradation of SVP. However, the prevention of seed production through the formation of leaf-like flowers likely is likely to present an advantage to phytoplasma

. Considering the role of SVP in leafhopper reproduction preference, we conducted transcriptional analyses to assess how leaves of svp mutant plants respond to male and female leafhopper exposure and compared this to male or female exposed SAP54 plants ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2A ). A comparable number of DEGs was found in leaves exposed to both males and females, with 464 DEGs uniquely responding to females, 347 to males, and 460 to both sexes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2B )

. Within the EES framework, parasitic genes like SAP54 evolve adaptively through both natural selection and direct biochemical interactions with plant regulators, as well as through the extended functions these regulators serve in interactions with insect vectors. In this study, we found that the extended role includes enhancing the likelihood of male vectors to attract females for reproduction.

., 2020 ). Based on these insights, we hypothesize that leafhopper attraction is influenced by MADS-box transcription factors involved in processes other than flowering. Here, we analysed the factors influencing leafhopper colonization preference in SAP54 plants. Surprisingly, we found that colonization preference on SAP54 plants only occurs in the presence of males on leaves during choice tests

. As such, these could influence female leafhoppers’ host plant selection and their egg-laying preferences on plants exposed to males. However, given that the removal of males from SAP54 leaves prior to female choice does not enhance female colonization ( comparison of Figure 1 treatment 4 with treatment 5 ), we cannot exclude that male produced volatiles or mating calls can enhance or supplement SAP54-dependent changes in biotic stress responses to males for enhanced female attraction

. Together, the fecundity and honeydew secretion data indicate that attraction of SAP54 plants to fecund female leafhoppers relies on the simultaneous presence of leafhopper males on the plants. The females produce more progeny and feed more on these plants only when males are present, even when the males are physically separated from the females

Here, we investigated colonization preferences of the leafhopper vector M. quadrilineatus, the predominant vector of AY-WB phytoplasma, for plants that produce the AY-WB effector SAP54. We made the surprising discovery that female preference for SAP54 plants only occurs in the presence of males. Both SAP54 and males are necessary for this preference, as females did not show a preference in their absence

. This is striking particularly given that only minimal transcriptional differences ( 266 DEGs ) are observed between leaves of SAP54 and GFP plants that were not exposed to insects ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A; Supplementary file 2E ). These data suggest that SAP54 modulates leaf responses of plants that are challenged by leafhopper herbivory, particularly leafhopper males. To better understand how SAP54 may alter leaf responses to the insects, A

. Moreover, our research showed that these three MTFs are expressed in leaves of SAP54 plants exposed to males, but not females ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ), and that SVP is degraded in leaves of SAP54 exposed to males, but not females ( Figure 2— supplement 3 ). These results indicate that SAP54 targets SVP in male-exposed leaves, but not female-exposed leaves, and that SVP plays a key role in leafopper preference for SAP plants exposed to males.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.

   . Here, we use the fungal DROP-seq system ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ) to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in the C. albicans response to antifungal drugs. We profiled the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells from C. albicans populations that were either untreated ( UT ) or exposed to antifungal compounds with a focus on FCZ across several days

In our preliminary pre-printed study ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ), we profiled C. albicans using a fungal nanoliter droplet-based assay ( DROP-seq ), modified from the original system presented by Macosko et al., 2015

The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay adapted for fungal cells enabled a detailed sc analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days. The assay was cost-effective and encountered minimal issues or failed runs. Studies of thousands of individual cells enriched our understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity

. These results align with several previous reports that associate cell cycle phase with the expression of stress response and metabolism-related genes ( Brauer et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2011; Hossain et al., 2021; Senn et al., 2012 ). We next investigated the C. albicans response to antifungal compounds using fungistatic FCZ ( 1 µg/ml, 1–2 × MIC50, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ), and fungicidal CSP ( 1 ng/ml, <0. 03 × MIC )

The underlying mechanisms and implications of antifungal drug tolerance differ from those of bacterial heteroresistance, in which a small subpopulation exhibits growth in bacteriocidal drugs ( Andersson et al., 2019 ).

. While single-cell ( sc ) transcriptomic assays have been applied extensively to mammalian systems, their use in fungal contexts remains limited due to the challenges of disrupting the rigid cell wall, lysing the membrane, and the small overall amount of RNA per cell. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several limited microfluidic or barcoding sc studies examined approximately a hundred cells ( Gasch et al., 2017; Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019b; Nadal-Ribelles et al

We first optimized the removal of the cell wall, as well as the time and concentration parameters to fix the transcriptome ( Materials and methods, ‘Strains, media, and drug treatment’, ‘Spheroplasts’ ). We then built a nanoliter droplet-based system modified from Macosko et al., 2015, using in-house components as described previously ( Booeshaghi et al., 2019 ), to reduce the device and assay costs

Here, by examining cellular trajectories across populations in a high-throughput manner, we obtained new insights into time-sensitive processes, such as the emergence of drug tolerance during 2–3 days of drug exposure and the existence of cells with Rd and Sd states, which reflect two different cellular states within the RASTR response described as a molecular signature of an S. cerevisiae stress response

The profiles reported here combine our preliminary effort ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ) with additional data and analyses to provide increased power to examine the technical and biological efficacy of our system.

., 2018 ). A resistant fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of that species, with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure

Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens ( Benedict et al., 2019; Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015; Pappas et al., 2018 ). Systemic C. albicans infections are the second most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases in extremely premature infants ( 15–20% mortality ), and the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections ( 30–50% mortality ) ( Benjamin et al., 2010; Brown and Netea,2019 ). The socio-economic burden of C. alb is significant, with an estimated annual cost in the United States alone of $7.2 billion in 2019 ( Benjamin et al. 2019 ). Antifungal drugs are the primary treatment for C. alb, but drug resistance is a growing concern, especially in immunocompromised patients ( Kullberg and Arend,2015 ). The mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance in C alb differ from those of bacterial drug resistance ( Anders et al,2019 ), where a small subpopulation exhibits growth in bacteriocidal drugs ( Anders et al,2019 ). In this study, the focus is on antifungal to FCZ, a well-known fungist drug. Previous studies have characterized aspects of drug in C alb, but the underlying mechanisms of tolerance are not fully understood.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

   . Here, we extend the CAI, using the information-theory-based Kullback–Leibler divergence, so that it corrects for both GC and amino acid composition ( see Methods ) to create a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ). The availability of a complete genome allows both metrics to be readily calculated without data on polymorphism or mutation rate, without selecting reference genes, and without concerns about demographic history

. Since codon bias varies quantitatively within only a small range of sN ( Figure 1 ), a promising approach is to measure the proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective. We posit that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias ( Figure 2; Galtier et al., 2018 )

. Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation, than do estimates of effective population size that are based on neutral polymorphism. Both CAIS and ENC can also be estimated for far more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances, but only a single complete genome. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies

. Here, we developed a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. We chose vertebrates partly due to the abundance of suitable data, and partly as a stringent test case, given past studies finding limited evidence for codon adaptation ( Kessler and Dean, 2014 ). It remains to be seen how CAIS behaves among species with stronger codon adaptation

., 2014 ). The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage that is driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species ( Li, 1987; Bulmer, 1991; Akashi, 1996; Subramanian, 2008 ). Conveniently, it can be estimated from only a single genome, that is, without polymorphism or mutation rate data for that species. One commonly used metric, the Codon Adaptation Index ( CAI ) ( Sharp and Li, 1987; Sharp et al

. Specifically, species that make more use of an amino acid for which there is stronger selection among codons ( which is sometimes the case Vicario et al., 2007 ) would have higher codon bias, even if each amino acid considered on its own had identical codon bias irrespective of which species it is in. Confounding with amino acid frequencies has been shown to be a problem at the individual protein level ( Cope et al., 2018 )

., 2014 ). Here, we control for %GC, capturing species differences both in mutation and in gene conversion, by calculating the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the observed codon frequencies away from the codon frequencies that we would expect to see given the genomic %GC content of the species. Kullback–Leibler divergence measures the distance of an observed probability distribution from an expected reference distribution, capturing a measure of surprise ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 )

. For this reason, we define CAIS as the observed Kullback–Leibler divergence ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 ) from the codon usage expected given the GC content. The GC content pertinent to this expectation depends primarily on mutation bias and GC-biased gene conversion ( Romiguier and Roux, 2017 ), but potentially also on selection on individual nucleotide substitutions that is hypothesized to favor higher %GC ( Long et al., 2018 )

., 2021 ), and/or by differences among sequences in their subsequent tendency to proliferate into many different genes ( James et al., 2023 ). To focus only on the effects of descent with modification, we use a linear mixed model, with each species having a fixed effect on ISD, while controlling for Pfam domain identity as a random effect. We note that once GC is controlled for, codon adaptation can be assessed similarly in intrinsically disordered vs

. The proteome-wide average depends on the fraction of sites whose selection coefficients exceed the ‘drift barrier’ for that particular species ( Figure 2, blue threshold ). In estimating the effects of selection, it is critical to control for other causes of codon bias

. While usually used to compare genes within a species, among-species comparisons can be made using a reference set of genes that are highly expressed ( Sharp and Li, 1987 ). Each codon i is assigned an RSCU value: ( 1 ) RSCUi=Ni1na∑j=1naNj, where Ni denotes the number of times that codon i is used, and the denominator sums over all na codons that code for that specific amino acid

. These remaining codon-adaptive factors do not create a statistically convincing correlation between CAIS and GC ( Figure 3C ), nor between ENC and GC ( Figure 3B ), although CAI is strongly correlated with GC ( Figure 3A ). Notably, our new CAIS metric of codon adaptation controls for amino acid frequencies, rather than, like ENC, only GC content

. Many vertebrates have higher recombination rates and hence GC-biased gene conversion near genes; in this case genome-wide GC content would misestimate the codon usage expected from the combination of mutation bias and GC-biased gene conversion in the vicinity of genes. If GC-biased gene conversion drove CAIS, we expect high |localGC¯− globalGC| to predict high CAIS

. Our purpose is to find an accessible metric that can quantify the limits to weak selection important to nearly neutral theory; this differs from past evaluations focused on comparing different genes of the same species and recapitulating ‘ground truth’ simulations thereof ( Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2018 )

., 2010 ) takes the average of Relative Synonymous Codon Usage ( RSCU ) scores, which quantify how often a codon is used, relative to the codon that is most frequently used to encode that amino acid in that species. While this works well for comparing genes within the same species, it unfortunately means that the species-wide strength of codon bias appears in the normalizing denominator ( see Equation 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A )

CAI is seriously confounded with GC content ( Figure 3A ). ENC is not confounded with GC content ( Figure 3B ), while CAIS has only a very weak correlation that is not significant after correction for multiple comparisons ( Figure 3C ). As an example of how correlations with codon adaptation metrics can be used to identify weak selective preferences, we investigate protein ISD. Disordered proteins are more likely to be harmful when overexpressed ( Vavouri et al

. Sharp and Li, 1987 quantified codon bias through the CAI, a normalized geometric mean of synonymous codon usage bias across sites, excluding stop and start codons. We modify this to calculate CAI including stop and start codons, because of documented preferences among stop codons in mammals ( Wangen and Green, 2020 )

., 2018 ). A more complex metric could control for more than just GC content and amino acid frequencies. First vs. second vs. third codon positions have different nucleotide usage on average, but while correcting for this might be useful for comparing genes ( Zhang et al., 2012 ), correcting for it while comparing species might remove the effect of interest. Similarly, while it might be useful to control for dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies ( Brbić et al

. But drift barrier theory concerns the level with which adaptation is fine-tuned, and so a better metric would capture that directly, rather than indirectly rely on neutral diversity. An alternative approach to measure the efficiency of selection exploits codon usage bias, which is influenced by weak selection for factors such as translational speed and accuracy ( Hershberg and Petrov, 2008; Plotkin and Kudla, 2011; Hunt et al., 2014 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

   . E. coli, which is one of the most frequent facultative pathogens in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP isolated from a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis. After having demonstrated that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP, we next questioned whether and how ATP release is dependent on ATP generation

. This effect is dependent on released bacterial ATP given that no differences in bacterial counts were observed ( see Figure 4D and E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E ). In summary, ATP released by bacteria suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsened survival in a model of abdominal sepsis. ATP is rapidly metabolized in the extracellular space and therefore, the mode of action of released bacterial ATP is limited to the immediate cellular vicinity ( Junger, 2011 )

., 2016a; Ding and Tan, 2016b ). However, the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or the blood in the context of local and systemic infections, remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated if ATP released from bacteria influences the outcome of abdominal sepsis. We first isolated sepsis-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release

. In the mouse model, E. coli released notably more cumulative ATP compared to E. faecalis and S. aureus ( Figure 1G and H ). The bacterial species assessed in humans and mice ( E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus ) differed on the strain level ( sequences deposited, see Data availability statement ) confirming that ATP release is strain-specific ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). In summary, sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner. E

. Recently, it has been discovered that also bacteria release ATP into the extracellular space ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). Such ATP release might be a conserved mechanism of protection from host defense and precede host responses. ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) from the Proteobacteria phylum or Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S

., 2016; Spari and Beldi, 2020 ). In particular, we have described that the connexin-dependent release of ATP by macrophages initiates an autocrine loop of over-activation, resulting in altered local and systemic cytokine secretion, which exacerbates abdominal sepsis ( Dosch et al., 2019 ). Such sepsis-promoting effects of host-derived extracellular ATP are secondary to inflammation initiated by bacterial pathogens

. Bacterial ATP reduces neutrophil counts, activates the endolysosomal system, and upregulates neutrophil degranulation, which together increase the severity of abdominal infection and early sepsis. These findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal sepsis, e. g., by in vitro generated OMV that modulate neutrophil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purinergic receptors during sepsis.

., 2023; Vega-Pérez et al., 2021; Zindel et al., 2021 ) but not dependent on ATP release according to our data. Interestingly, however, the number of small peritoneal macrophages ( SPM ) and CX3CR1pos monocytes was significantly reduced, whereas neutrophils were significantly increased almost up to 8 hr ( Figure 4I, Figure 4—figure supplement 1G ) in bacterial ATP-depleted abdominal sepsis ( PS+pAPY )

. We conclude from these data that destabilization of the outer bacterial membrane ( as observed with the ΔompF mutant ) results in bacterial death that is associated with ATP release. In summary, outer membrane integrity and finally bacterial death notably contribute to the amount of bacterial ATP release during growth. Next, we wanted to investigate the function of bacterial ATP release in vivo. To study this, we transformed the E

. However, the outcome of sepsis is not only dependent on local but also on systemic responses to microorganisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that bacterial ATP has systemic effects as protected cargo in OMV ( Alvarez et al., 2017 ). OMV are small ( 20–300 nm ) spherical particles that are released by both gramneg and grampos bacteria ( Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015 ). In gramneg bacteria, they bulge off the outer membrane and disseminate throughout the body ( Jang et al., 2015 )

. Second, we analyzed the function of the inner bacterial membrane on ATP release over time in E. coli and in E. coli with mutations in integral respiratory chain proteins ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). Third, the function of the outer bacterial membrane on ATP release during growth was assessed using porin mutants ( Alvarez et al., 2017; Choi and Lee, 2019 ). Fourth, we investigated local effects of ATP in the abdominal cavity

. These pathways explain in part the low neutrophil counts we observed in mice. Such remote degranulation in response to OMV is unlikely to control bacteria at the source of sepsis but rather harmful to host tissues increasing sepsis severity ( Eichelberger and Goldman, 2020 ). The study has several limitations: Bacterial ATP release is strain specific ( Figure 1; Mempin et al., 2013 ). As we focused on the laboratory BW25113 E

. Yet, despite similar bacterial counts, the survival was significantly higher in the absence of bacterial ATP ( PS+pAPY ) compared to ATP-generating controls ( PS+pEMPTY ) after i. a. injection ( Figure 4F ). Next, we asked how this difference in bacterial ATP release affects the immune system. Therefore, inflammatory cells in the abdominal cavity were characterized using flow cytometry ( Figure 4G )

. We did not interfere with ATP generation at the inner membrane but deliberately challenged the outer membrane and tested therewith if destabilization of the outer membrane integrity is associated with bacterial death. Indeed, outer membrane integrity and bacterial death are significantly increased in ΔompF compared to ΔompC and the PS after 4 hr ( ATP peak ) of culturing ( Figure 3E and F ), akin to the amount of released ATP ( Figure 3G )

., 2019 ) as well as in chemotaxis ( Junger, 2011 ), increased cell death, impaired infiltration, or a combination of both is possible. This study reveals that ATP is released by bacteria during growth because of impaired membrane integrity and bacterial death. ATP is also being released via OMV and therefore acts locally ( direct release ) and systemically ( via OMV )

. Lastly, based on the finding that bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) ( Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015 ), we investigated systemic consequences of released bacterial ATP.

To assess ATP release of sepsis-associated bacteria, abdominal fluid of patients with abdominal sepsis was sampled and an/aerobically incubated on LB agar plates ( Figure 1A ). Twenty-five different colonies were randomly picked and analyzed by whole 16S-rRNA Sanger sequencing, which resulted in 12 different bacterial species ( Figure 1B ). From these, the four most clinically important sepsis-associated bacteria E. coli, K. pneumoniae ( both gramneg ), E. faecalis, and S

. In colonized compartments such as the intestine, it has been shown that ATP released by mutualistic bacteria modulates local cellular and secretory immune responses ( Atarashi et al., 2008; Perruzza et al., 2017; Pro et al. 2018 ). However, in the context of sepsis, the role of extracellular ATP released by non-colonized bacteria remains to be determined. In this study, we used a mouse model of abdominal seis to investigate the effects of ATP released by seps-associated bacteria on the outcome of sepsis. First, we isolated seps-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release. In the model, E coli released more ATP compared to E faalis and S aureus ( Figure 1G and H ) The species assessed in humans and mice ( E coli E faalis S aure ) differed on the level sequences ( deposited see Data statement ) confirming ATP release is strain-specific ( Memp et al,2013 ) In summary seps-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth and strain-dependent manner

The study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In children, psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs. Using large-scale longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children. We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6, 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ). Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

   . Toward this goal, we firstly assess the associations of cognitive phenotype PGSs, family and neighborhood SES, and supportive environment with children’s cognitive intelligence and longitudinally measured PLEs. To maintain robustness of our assessment, we employed statistical and computational approaches to carefully consider potential confounding. We then test the mediating effect of cognitive intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs

. In this study, we employ linear mixed models and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method to examine the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs mediated by cognitive intelligence. We specifically investigate the mediating role of cognitive intelligence within the impacts of cognitive phenotype PGSs, high family SES, low neighborhood SES, and positive family and school environments on PLEs

Our linear mixed model and IGSCA analyses were adjusted using sex, age, marital status, BMI, family history of psychiatric disorders, and ABCD research sites as covariates. As shown in Figure 2, higher PGSs of cognitive capacity phenotypes correlated significantly with higher intelligence ( CP PGS: β = 0. 1113–0. 1793; EA PGS: β = 0

. Next, we tested effects of gene × environment interactions on cognitive intelligence and PLEs, respectively. We also tested the effects of cognitive phenotypes PGS adjusting for schizophrenia PGS, given the association of schizophrenia PGS and cognitive deficit in psychosis patients ( Shafee et al., 2018 ) and individuals at-risk of psychosis ( He et al., 2021 )

Studies with older clinical samples have shown that cognitive deficit may be a precursor for the onset of psychotic disorders ( Eastvold et al., 2007; Fett et al., 2020; Vorstman et al., 2015 ). Our study advances this by demonstrating the integrated effects of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through the cognitive intelligence in 9- to 11-year-old children

. g., familial vs neighborhood ) to dissect the genetic and environmental effects underlying abnormal cognitive intelligence and the PLEs. Addressing this with large multimodal data will allow for a more complete understanding of the factors related to the development of PLEs. In this study, we systematically explore the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs, mediated through cognitive intelligence

. The environmental factors ( family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive parenting and schooling ) and PGS of cognitive phenotypes exhibit significant indirect effects via cognitive intelligence on PLEs. Prior research identifying the mediation of cognitive intelligence focused on either genetic ( Karcher et al., 2022 ) or environmental factors ( Lewis et al., 2020 ) alone

., 2021 ). Maladaptive cognitive intelligence may act as a mediator for the effects of genetic and environmental risks on the manifestation of psychotic symptoms ( Cannon et al., 2000; Keefe et al., 2006; Reichenberg et al., 2005 ). Abnormal neurodevelopment, influenced by genetic factors, combined with disrupted cognitive processes resulting from socioenvironmental adversity, may eventually give rise to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, relevant to PLEs ( Garety et al

., 2001; Howes and Murray, 2014 ). Family studies show a decline in cognitive intelligence preceding psychotic symptoms is related to genetic risk ( Cosway et al., 2000; Curtis et al., 2001 ). In more recent studies, these associations have led to the model positing that cognitive intelligence mediates the genetic risk for psychopathology and PLEs ( Karcher et al., 2022; Pat et al., 2022 )

. PGSs for CP and EA were strongly correlated with PLEs ( baseline year, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up ). These associations were robust after adjustment for schizophrenia PGS, ethnic confounding and unobserved confounders. Cognitive phenotypes PGS generally show higher predictive performance than PGS of any other traits ( Lee et al., 2018; Okbay et al., 2022; Plomin and von Stumm, 2018 )

We used the multimodal genetic and environmental data of 11, 878 preadolescent children aged 9–10 years old collected from 21 research sites of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ( ABCD ) Study, one of the largest longitudinal studies for children’s neurodevelopment in the United States. We analyzed the baseline, first year, and second year follow-up datasets included in ABCD Release 4. 0, downloaded on January 25, 2022

., 2020 ). Similar to the terms used in prior research, we will collectively refer to these two PGSs of focus as ‘cognitive phenotypes PGSs’ throughout this paper ( Joo et al., 2022; Okbay et al., 2022; Selzam et al., 2019 ). An important gap in the literature is the lack of integrated assessment of the effects of genetic and environmental factors at multiple levels ( e. g

. 1068 to −0. 0586 ) ( Supplementary file 1 ). The IGSCA model showed that intelligence mediated the effects of genes and environments on the risk for psychosis ( PLEs ) ( Figure 3 and Table 2 ). Estimated factor loadings of latent factor variable and weights of component variables are presented in Supplementary file 1. Correlation matrices between component/factor variables are presented in Appendix 3—figure 1. The model showed a good model fit with a GFI of 0. 9735, SRMR of 0

., 2020; Karcher et al., 2021 ). Self- and parent-reported PLEs had significant positive correlation ( Pearson’s correlation of baseline year: r = 0. 095–0. 0989, p < 0. 0001; 1-year follow-up: r = 0. 1322–0. 1327, p < 0. 0001; 2-year follow-up: r = 0. 1569–0. 1632, p < 0. 0001 ). To investigate the aggregated effect of genetic components, we estimated PGS of two representative cognitive phenotypes for each participant: EA and CP ( Cho et al., 2022 )

. 0699–0. 1793 ) remained robust and similar in magnitude after adjusting for genetic ancestry ( β = 0. 0754–0. 1866 ) and other ( unobserved ) confounding ( β = 0. 0546–0. 1776 ). As we controlled for family-, neighborhood-, and school-level environmental factors and unobserved confounders, our results may be interpreted as significant genetic influences on individual’s cognitive intelligence. This interpretation is supported by a recent study ( Isungset et al

. The theory suggests that genetic influence for cognitive phenotypes and environmental enrichment promotes more efficient, flexible brain networks, which may lead to greater resilience against psychopathology ( Stern, 2009 ). Indeed, prior clinical studies show the linkage between cognitive reserve and psychosis ( Amoretti et al., 2018; Leeson et al., 2018 ). Our findings suggest that cognitive mediates the effects of genetic and environmental factors on PLE in children, which is consistent with prior research ( Karch et al,202; et al. 202 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In this study, we investigated the exclusive, long-term effects of FGF8 signaling on human cerebral organoids by enabling proper differentiation of FOXG1+ telencephalic cells and assessing molecular and cellular changes across developmental stages

. Transcriptomic analysis of FGF8-treated versus untreated cerebral organoids revealed a clear FGF8-mediated induction of ventral telencephalic genes, suggesting that one of the primary roles of FGF8 signaling within telencephalic territories may be the promotion of ventral identity. Consistently, we observed upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3 and simultaneous downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2

. Our findings indicate that FGF8 treatment leads to altered regional identities in 3D organoids compared to untreated controls, resulting in the development of multi-regional organoids with distinct co-developing brain domains. FGF8 efficiently modulates NR2F1 and other genes associated with brain disorders in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells, underscoring its critical role in the fine-tuning of key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways

. In summary, our findings highlight an FGF8-dependent effect on regional identity, along with the modulation of several NDD-related targets, including an evolutionarily conserved FGF8-NR2F1 molecular axis. In conclusion, we propose that FGF8-mediated modulation of key developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the D/V and A/P telencephalic axes

. Interestingly, the ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes can also vary based on the regional identity of the FGF8-exposed cells. The co-presence of various regional domains in FGF8-treated organoids - specifically dorsal and ventral telencephalon, as well as diencephalic and mesencephalic regions - represents a significant outcome

. Early in development, when acting on unspecified progenitors, FGF8 serves as a potent inducer of posteriorized identity, capable of specifying discrete diencephalic/mesencephalic-like domains in brain organoids. However, as development progresses and FOXG1 expression becomes established, consolidating a telencephalic fate, FGF8 acts as a regulator of A/P and D/V identities in forebrain cells

. Through long-term treatment of human organoids, we identified a correlation between FGF signaling activation and the modulation of several developmental and/or neurodevelopmental disorder ( NDD ) -related genes. Among the FGF8-regulated genes, NR2F1 was the most significantly affected, suggesting that it may be a primary effector of FGF8 signaling in telencephalic development

. Collectively, our data redefine the role of FGF8 as a crucial morphogen for regional patterning and the establishment of distinct D/V and A/P telencephalic identities in human cells, thus highlighting its significance in modulating the expression of key developmental and NDD-related genes during the organization of the human brain.

. Notably, we identified FOXG1+ telencephalic areas containing both TBR1+ dorsal cortical neurons and ventral GABAergic cells, alongside more posterior OTX2+ FOXG1- diencephalic/mesencephalic-like domains. By enhancing organoid complexity, FGF8 signaling enables the formation of more biologically realistic models of human brain assembly in vitro

. However, the global identity of both FGF8-treated and untreated organoids, based on transcriptional similarity to human fetal brain areas, remained aligned with somatosensory and pre-frontal cortical regions, indicating only a limited effect on full A/P areal specification. Optimizing FGF8 doses or timing could enhance A/P areal identity control in telencephalic organoids

., 2022; Alzu’bi et al., 2017b ). In this context, FGF8 may enhance an inherent GABAergic-producing capacity in human telencephalic progenitors by promoting the expression of LGE markers. Thus, FGF8-induced ventral LGE identity in human organoids may reflect a species-specific feature: the intrinsic potential of human glutamatergic progenitors to produce GABAergic neurons with an LGE-like molecular profile

. Together, our results indicate a robust, telencephalon-specific effect of FGF8 on determining the dorsal/ventral ( D/V ) identity—glutamatergic versus GABAergic—of neural progenitors and neurons during human brain development in vitro. To assess whether changes in D/V neuronal composition would affect functional neuroelectric activity, we used a multi-electrode array ( MEA ) system on 4- and 7-month-old FGF8-treated organoids ( Figure 5 )

., 2019; Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ). VoxHunt Similarity brain maps indicated that FGF8-treated organoids maintained a high similarity score with the anterior-most sections of the dorsal telencephalon, while similarity to posterior regions was nearly lost ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ). This suggests that FGF8 treatment preferentially supports the expression of anterior cortical genes

., 2009; Perrier et al., 2004 ). Consistently, our findings revealed that the early addition of FGF8 to the culture media resulted in the abolition of FOXG1 expression, thereby preventing telencephalic induction. Importantly, our data indicate that in human brain organoids, day10-11 represents the optimal window for FGF8 application, allowing for the preservation of FOXG1 expression and telencephalic identity while effectively modulating FGF8 target genes such as NR2F1

. Collectively, our data suggest that while WNTi organoids develop as uniform FOXG1+ telencephalic organoids predominantly expressing cortical markers, FGF8-treated organoids form distinct and segregated regional domains. Therefore, elevated levels of FGF8 can enhance the complexity of human cultured organoids in vitro by promoting the formation of multi-regional structures, where distinct brain regions co-exist and develop concurrently within a single aggregate

. Real-time qRT-PCR analysis of known FGF8 target genes ( SPRY4, DUSP6, ETV4, ETV1, and ETV5 ) confirmed that our set-up efficiently activated FGF signaling in day20 and day30 organoids ( Figure 2B ). As a specific read-out of FGF8 treatment on the expression of telencephalic targets, we stained control ( WNTi ) and treated ( WNTi + FGF8 ) organoids for NR2F1 and FOXG1 at different time points ( Figure 2C–I and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 )

. Notably, prolonged exposure to FGF8 affects not only A/P areal identity but also D/V telencephalic cell identity. As a result, FGF8-treated brain organoids exhibit an imbalance in the production of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which impacts the formation of electrical neural networks

. To achieve a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of A/P identity in telencephalic organoids, we used a SingleR approach to compare the transcriptomic profiles of control and FGF8-treated organoids against a reference dataset of distinct human fetal brain regions at 16 post-conception weeks ( PCWs ), including parietal, motor, prefrontal, somatosensory, temporal, and visual cortices ( Bhaduri et al., 2020; Eze et al., 2021; Nowakowski et al., 2017; Speir et al

., 2006; Garel et al., 2003 ). Severe phenotypic alterations and cross-regulation between anterior ( FGF ), dorsal ( BMP, WNT ), and/or ventral ( SHH ) patterning centers in genetic loss-of-function ( LOF ) animal models obscure the specific role of FGF8 signaling in telencephalic development. Therefore, a system with controlled FGF8 signaling modulation is preferable

. These data indicate that clusters 8 and 9, which are only present in FGF8-treated organoids, are mainly composed of telencephalic progenitors ( FOXG1+, SFRP1 ) and dienceph/mesphalic progenitors (OT2 FOX1, TBR1 ), respectively., suggesting that F8 modulates the balance between telenceph and dience/mesphalic domains in human organoids

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that F8 plays a crucial role in patterning the telence and dienceph/mesalic domains in human organoids and modulating genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
Researchers investigated the development of circadian rhythms in Drosophila larvae, specifically focusing on the emergence of sleep-wake patterns and feeding behaviors. They found that in the 2nd instar larval stage (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar stage (L). Forcing mature L3 animals to adopt immature L2 feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and ability to exhibit long-term memory (LTM). The development of the clock circuit is influenced by the larval nutritional environment, and Dh44 neurons act through glucose genes to drive daily-wake rhythms. Data suggest changes in energetic demands trigger the formation of sleepirc circuits and behaviors.

In Drosila, Dh neurons act as nutrient sensors to regulate consumption and starvation-induced sleep through glucose and amino acid sensing genes. Adult sleep and feeding are consolidated to specific times of the day, with flies eating more during the day than night. Early in development, sleep lacks a circadian pattern in 2ndar larvae. The emergence of daily-wake is regulated by developmental changes in energetic, and Dh44 may be necessary for sensing larval environments. Dh neurons anatomically and functionally connect to DN1 output to drive consolidation in L. Development of this circuit promotes sleep in L, resulting in emergence of long-term capabilities at L but not before.

The authors identified cues that trigger the emergence of DN1-Dh circuit and consolidation-wake in Drosila larvae. Circadian-wake in Dila is advantageous, enabling long-term capabilities at L. Mature L do not exhibit consolidated-w patterns, prompting the question of why rhythmic behaviors do not emerge earlier. In L raised on S conditions, activation DNas no longer elicited response Dh neurons. The connection underlying circadian in Dila developmentally plastic, insufficient environment not functional, facilitating constant feeding that fulfills animal needs.

Data demonstrate larval Dh neurons require glucose genes not amino sensing to modulate-wake. Dh may have distinct functions from adult counterparts integrating information through glucose levels to modulate-w development. Gabox feeding in L, thermogenic of sleep disrupted larval development. This suggests sleep cannot be leveraged to enhance function because periods deep are not sustainable at this stage.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive. By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ), we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1. We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.

   . Fish schooling in the high-drag viscous aquatic medium serves as a model for understanding how group movement by animals can be a more energy-efficient biological collective than movement by isolated individuals. By increasing maximum aerobic performance, fish schools save anaerobic energy and reduce the recovery time after peak swimming performance

. We expect that the need to conserve energy in animals moving against air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds. We hypothesize that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority ( >50% ) of their aerobic capacity

. Our secondary objective is to determine the differences ( if any ) between the swimming performance curves ( metabolic rate versus speed ) of solitary fish and fish schools. To evaluate these hypotheses, we directly measured both the aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fishes over a wide range of water velocities ( 0. 3–8. 0 body lengths s–1; BL s–1 ), and then compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish

. Fish schools in nature swim over a wide range of speeds ( Appendix 1—figure 1 ) but no study has directly characterized the total energy expenditure ( TEE ), and accounted for the potentially substantial anaerobic metabolic costs involved in higher speed locomotion. As a result, the swimming TEE performance curve of fish schools from the minimum swimming speed to the critical swimming speed ( Ucrit ) has not yet been measured

We discovered that both solitary fish and fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate ( ṀO2 ) -speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range ( 0. 3–3 BL s–1, Figure 2C, D ). The aerobic locomotor cost at 0. 3–3 BL s–1 showed no statistical difference between solitary fish and fish schools ( F1, 80≤ 2. 40, p≥0. 13 ). Fish schools swimming at ~1. 0 BL s–1 consume less energy than at slower speeds ( F9, 40 = 24. 7, p≤0

. 8, p≤0. 03, Figure 2E ). Given that fish schools had a higher maximum aerobic performance, generally used a lower proportion of their aerobic scope, and individuals within the schools have a 14% lower fTB than the solitary fish at 8 BL s–1 ( 11. 5 vs. 13. 3 Hz, F1, 80 = 15. 1, p<0. 001 ), we predicted that fish schools, compared with solitary fish, use less anaerobic energy to supplement aerobic energy for the high-speed movement approaching their aerobic limit

., 2018 ) swimming at <2 BL s–1 ( Xu and Dabiri, 2020 ). In summary, our experiments on giant danio have demonstrated substantial energy conservation resulting from schooling dynamics across a wide range of speeds in fish. Direct measurement of both aerobic and non-aerobic energy use is critical for understanding the rapid collective movement of animals

. We also demonstrated that the need for energy saving in fish schools at lower speeds ( <3 BL s–1 or 38% Ucrit Figures 2E, 3D, E ) is not as crucial as at higher speeds where we demonstrated substantial energy savings in the schools compared to solitary individuals. Fluid drag is exponentially less at lower speeds compared to higher speeds

We discovered that a significant amount of energy conservation for active directional swimming occurs at speeds above 3 BL s–1. In nature, fish schools routinely exhibit active directional collective locomotion above ~6 BL s–1 ( Appendix 1—figure 1; Supplementary file 1c; Misund and Aglen, 1992 ), a speed that engages anaerobic glycolysis. Yet, there are no previous measurements of the anaerobic cost of schooling in fish

. Hence, we use fish schooling behavior as a model system to explore whether the fluid dynamics of collective movement ( active and directional movement of animal groups along a common trajectory Zhang and Lauder, 2023 ) can enable energetic savings compared to locomotion by a solitary individual. Fish schooling behaviors are some of the most prominent social and group activities exhibited by vertebrates

., 2014; Table 1 ). There are no direct measurements of metabolic energy consumption of collective movement in birds, and indeed this would be extremely challenging to accomplish. Although some energetic aspects of schooling fishes have been studied ( Parker, 1973; Abrahams and Colgan, 1985; Burgerhout et al., 2013; Currier et al., 2021; Hvas and Oppedal, 2019 ), these studies have analyzed a limited range of speeds and focused on aerobic metabolism ( see Table 1 )

., 2018; Lee et al., 2003 ). To present a complete energetic profile showing the total energy expenditure ( TEE ) of locomotion for fish schooling, we model the non-aerobic cost ( EPOC ) on top of the aerobic swimming performance curve. The model is rooted in the use of aerobic and glycolytic energy when fish swim above 50% Ucrit ( Peake and Farrell, 2006 ) and a commonly observed inflection point of faster anaerobic end-product accumulation is at ~50% aerobic scope ( LaForgia et al

. We present direct evidence of substantial non-aerobic energy saving by demonstrating the 65% lower EPOC ( Figure 2G ) used by fish that swam in schools. Anaerobic glycolysis is crucial in permitting continued movement when aerobic limits are reached at high swimming speeds ( Gaesser and Brooks, 1984 ). Often vertebrates at higher speeds use more fast twitch fibres that generate high-frequency contractile force in part through anaerobic glycolysis ( Jayne and Lauder, 1996; Rome et al

. Our current understanding of energy saving mechanisms during collective locomotion in fishes is largely based on computational fluid dynamic models with a few analyses using robotic systems ( Weihs, 1973; Li et al., 2020; Kelly and Menzer, 2023; Fish et al., 2016; Kurt and Moored, 2018 ) at low speed, but the link between such models and fish metabolic energy saving over a wide speed range is not yet established

. For swimming fish, fluid dynamic experiments have shown how collective movement can improve swimming efficiency due to interactions among deforming bodies and through interactions between moving animals and the local fluid environment ( these energy-saving mechanisms are summarized in Figure 1 )

. The TEE of fish schools was 38–53% lower than that of the solitary fish between 5 and 8 BL s–1 ( F1, 103 ≥ 7. 4, p≤0. 008; Figure 4D ). TEE of fish schools was only 42–143% higher than the aerobic metabolic rate at 5–8 BL s–1 ( F1, 96 ≥ 3. 5, p≤0. 001 ) and anaerobic metabolic energy only accounted for 29–58% of the TEE depending on speed ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, TEE of solitary fish was 131–465% higher than the aerobic metabolic rate between 5–8 BL s–1 ( F1, 112 ≥ 10. 7, p≤0

. Furthermore, by decreasing the proportion of metabolic capacity and recovery time devoted to locomotion, animals can apportion more energy to other fitness-related activities, such as digestion, growth and reproduction. More broadly, comprehending how the collective dynamics of animal movements in the water, land, and air can modify the energy use profiles of individuals provide a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of group locomotion.

. To answer the question of how schooling dynamics reduces TEE, we combine video analysis of fish tail beat kinematics with simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic measurements to compute energy expended per tail beat ( TEE•beat–1 ), and compared values for fish in schools to solitary ( Figure 5 ). Schools reduced TEEbeat by up to 56% compared to solitary ( F,103 = 7.4, p≤ 0.008 ). The TEEbeat of fish swimming in schools was 44% higher aerobic and 65% anaerobic compared to solitary ( F,103 = 7.4, p0.008 ; F,103 = 7.4 p 0.008 ), which lowered the TEE and cost of transport by up to 53%, the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish ( F,103  =7.4 p 0.008 ). Non-aerobic energy savings when fish swim in schools at high speeds can improve peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators. These savings may underlie the prevalence of group locomotion in fishes

The article discusses the energetic benefits of schooling in fish, specifically in terms of reduced energy expenditure and improved performance. The authors measured both aerobic and anaerobic energy use in schools and solitary fish over a wide range of speeds and found that schools have a concave shaped metabolism-speed curve with a minimum cost at 1 body length/s. Schools reduced total energy expenditure per beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish and had 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% anaerobic energy compared to solitary, lowering total energy expenditure and cost by up to 53%. Schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary. Non-anaerobic energy savings at high speeds improved peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators. These savings may underlie the prevalence of group locomotion in fishes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming ( Vijayan et al., 2019; Tannahill et al., 2013 ). Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ). Using primary human AM and MDM, we modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively

. These data indicate that priming AM alters the metabolic baselines of human tissue resident macrophages and not their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli. In order to compare the metabolic responses of AM with blood-derived macrophages, we next assessed MDM. Human MDM were left unprimed or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 ( both 10 ng/ml ). 24 hr after cytokine priming metabolic flux was monitored by recording ECAR and OCR at baseline for 30 min

., 2016; Gleeson et al., 2018 ). Having established that both IFN-γ and IL-4 can significantly alter metabolism in human macrophages we next sought to examine the ability of AM and MDM to secrete cytokines when primed with IFN-γ or IL-4. Human AM ( Figure 4A, C and E ) and MDM ( Figure 4B, D and F ) were left unprimed or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr. Macrophages were then stimulated with iH37Rv or LPS

., 2018 ). There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively, in human macrophages, especially in tissue resident macrophages, such as AM. A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic, regulatory tissue resident phenotype

. Since IFN-γ drove glycolysis in both AM and MDM, we next sought to examine if cytokine production was associated with enhanced glycolysis. Human AM ( Figure 5A, C and E ) and MDM ( Figure 5B, D and F ) were primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr or left unprimed. Macrophages were treated with 2DG ( 5 mM ) for 1 hr prior to stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS

. These novel data demonstrate differential metabolic responses within human macrophage subpopulations that are linked with functionality. Furthermore, these data address a knowledge gap in human respiratory innate immunology and provide evidence that the AM is a tractable target to support human respiratory health.

Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the sentinels of the lung and the first responders to respiratory insults such as infection. Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages, there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments

. IL-4 primed AM had reduced fold change in glycolysis upon stimulation with LPS compared with controls. Having established that energetic responses are plastic in response to IFN-γ in the AM and that post stimulation energetic responses are different in human macrophage types under Th1 or Th2 priming conditions, we next sought to determine the effect on the plasticity of the macrophage phenotype by examining expression of activation markers associated with antigen presentation function

. Since IFN-γ drove glycolysis and the expression of the macrophage activation markers CD40 and HLA-DR in both AM and MDM we wanted to examine if the increased glycolysis was associated with enhanced expression of activation markers expression. Human AM ( Figure 3A, C and E ) and MDM ( Figure 3B, D and F ) were primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr or left unprimed. Macrophages were then treated with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2DG for 1 hr prior to stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS

. To further examine the function of IFN-γ or IL-4 primed macrophages, we stimulated cells with the gram-negative bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), or whole bacteria, irradiated Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb; iH37Rv ). Firstly, we assessed the metabolic phenotype of unprimed human AM, or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4. IFN-γ significantly increased the cellular energetics of both human AM and MDM

. Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency, ontogeny, cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors ( Huang et al., 2018; Ginhoux et al., 2010 ). Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes ( Wang et al., 2018 )

. Our data supports the hypothesis that there may be distinct roles for AM and infiltrating MDM during infection since IFN-γ increased metabolic responses are mechanistically associated with different cellular functions. Our data demonstrates that cytokine production in human AM can be promoted by supporting cellular metabolism, thus providing evidence that human tissue resident AM are a tractable target for host-directed immuno-supportive adjunctive therapies.

. Furthermore, while IL-10 was not associated with differential energetic profiles, its production is significantly attenuated by 2DG in both human macrophage populations, irrespective of priming. These data indicate that IFN-γ priming has a profound effect on AM function which is mediated, at least in part, by metabolic reprogramming.

. Therefore, where 2DG had no effect, a role for glycolysis cannot be definitively excluded. Furthermore, only one dose of IFN-γ was utilised due to limitations in AM yield; however, recently both low and high doses of IFN-γ have been shown to have similar effects on AM in vitro ( Thiel et al., 2024 ). Establishing the immunometabolic and functional outputs of human macrophages will aid in future work examining the plasticity of the human AM

. Moreover, AM upregulation of cell surface markers ( with the exception of CD40 ) in response to priming or stimulation is not associated with glycolysis, in contrast to the MDM. Changes in macrophage metabolism have been previously associated with altered cytokine production ( Tannahill et al., 2013; Gleeson et al., 2016; Gleeson et al., 2018 )

. IFN-γ promotes increased cellular energetics in stimulated human MDM by promoting both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, whilst maintaining the capacity for the cells to shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism in response to stimulation. IL-4 priming significantly reduced the cellular energetics compared with control or IFN-γ primed MDM. Importantly, IL-4 prevents the ability of M to shift to ‘War’ metabolism in response to stimulation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day. 

    Supporting Text:
   . While it has been theorised that this ability to detect the much dimmer polarisation pattern produced by the moon may be present across nocturnal insects more broadly, including nocturnal bees and crickets ( Herzmann and Labhart, 1989; Greiner et al., 2007; Rost and Honegger, 1987 ), there is currently no behavioural evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation. We sought such evidence in nocturnal bull ants

. Thus, M. midas makes for an interesting species to characterise lunar and solar polarised light detection. While we cannot compare solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in outbound ants ( outbound foraging is highly correlated with evening twilight when the solar light would overpower any moonlight polarisation pattern ), striking similarities occur when comparing solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in ants homing to the nest ( Figure 7 )

. We sought such evidence in nocturnal bull ants. The large-eyed Myrmecia ants have several species that restrict the majority of their navigation to evening twilight ( outbound ) and morning twilight ( inbound ), respectively ( Narendra et al., 2017 ). We know that two well-studied nocturnal ant species, Myrmecia pyriformis, and Myrmecia midas, use the overhead solar polarised light pattern, which is still visible during the twilight period to derive compass information ( Reid et al

. This ability occurs across the lunar phase, suggesting that polarised moonlight is a detectable cue throughout the lunar month. Heading changes due to polarised moonlight align with responses to polarised sunlight as part of the path integrator during solar twilight. This indicates that polarised moonlight is likely detected and integrated into the ant’s path integrator for inbound homing along the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight

., 2015; Freas et al., 2017c ). Second, these ants are using polarised moonlight precisely the same way they use solar polarisation, meaning polarised moonlight is likely integrated into the forager’s path integrator throughout the night. Polarised moonlight is likely processed through the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight, meaning that these ants can use the same underlying neural architecture for polarised solar light and polarised moonlight cues

. In the current study, we studied foraging ants’ ability to orient during lunar twilight, by placing and rotating a linear polarising filter over them as they returned to the nest ( Figure 1A ). This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern

The nocturnal bull ants Myrmecia pyriformis and Myrmecia midas are known to use the solar-polarised light pattern during the twilight periods ( Reid et al., 2011; Freas and Cheng, 2017a; Freas et al., 2017b ), yet both species are active after twilight, when solar polarisation cues are absent ( Reid et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2013; Freas et al., 2017b; Freas et al., 2017c ). The observed true nocturnal navigation in these animals could be driven by the moon’s presence with M

. Several arthropods, including ants and bees, directly track the moon’s position to obtain compass information ( Jander, 1957; Klotz and Reid, 1993; Dacke et al., 2004; Ugolini et al., 2013 ). But given the moon may be occluded by clouds or overhanging canopy we aim to identify here whether the lunar polarised skylight can also be used by ants for homing

. In this vein, it remains unknown if these ants are tracking their lunar polarisation compass by using a time-compensated lunar compass, or if the compass is updated with reference to other cues, such as the panorama, throughout the night. It is possible that these ants form a lunar ephemeris function or time compensator for the moon’s position

. We also explored whether these navigators weigh their attendance to polarised moonlight across the lunar cycle, since during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights, smaller portions of the moon’s surface reflect sunlight ( as well as moonless nights when no ambient e-vector is present ). Finally, we characterised changes in weighting that these ant navigators give polarised moonlight, as a function of the moon’s overnight consistency in the sky ( waxing vs

., 2015 ). Like solar polarisation, though a million times weaker, the moon reflects sunlight, producing a polarised moonlight pattern emanating from the moon’s position in the night sky ( Gál et al., 2001 ). Given that the moon creates a much dimmer version of the polarisation pattern formed around the sun, only night-navigating insects with eyes highly specialised for low-light detection may be able to rely on this pattern to orient and navigate to goals

. The limiting factors to lunar cue use for navigation would instead be the ant’s detection threshold for either absolute light intensity, polarization sensitivity, or spectral sensitivity. In addition to being dimmer, moonlight is less UV-rich compared to direct sunlight, and its spectrum changes across the lunar cycle ( Palmer and Johnsen, 2015 ), with sensitivity to green spectrum within polarised moonlight of potential importance for orientation ( Yilmaz et al., 2024 )

. For each condition, we altered the pattern of polarised moonlight by rotating a linear polarisation filter ( Polaroid HN22 analogue, 30 cm diameter ) above each ant along their inbound journey. This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern

., 2024 ). Foragers showed clear evidence of detecting and employing polarised moonlight when homing to the nest across the lunar cycle, even on waxing crescent moon nights. This aligns with polarised moonlight’s use in dung beetles, with individuals able to maintain their straight-line paths under quarter and crescent moon e-vectors ( Dacke et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, the lack of a shift-magnitude reduction between full and crescent nights suggests no reduction in detection

. Solar ephemeris functions are well demonstrated in insect navigators ( Mouritsen and Frost, 2002; Massy and Wotton, 2023 ), including honeybees ( Dyer and Dickinson, 1994 ) as well as desert ants ( Wehner and Lanfranconi, 1981 ). This study cannot untangle these possibilities as ants had a continuous view of both the sky and surrounding terrestrial cues throughout the night before testing

. In M. pyriformis, on ‘full-moon’ nights there was a significantly greater proportion of foragers leaving the nest at night compared to a ‘new-moon’ night ( Reid et al., 2013 ). This additional light at night may enhance terrestrial visual features foragers have learned and, therefore, assist in visual guidance. In addition, the moon and the lunar polarisation pattern also likely provide compass information, allowing foragers to acquire or follow a homing vector

. To assess if polarised moonlight can be used throughout the lunar month, we tested Nest 1 foragers in three further conditions representing distinct lunar phases: a Waxing Quarter Moon, a Waxing Crescent Moon, and a No Moon control. For the Quarter Moon and Crescent Moon conditions, we tested ants identically to full moon conditions; for overnight testing, however, the moon has a different temporal period when it is positioned near the horizon ( 12 am and 9 pm, respectively )

., 2018; Islam et al., 2020; Deeti et al., 2023 ) and homing vectors obtained by integrating pedometric and celestial compass information ( Weh et al., 2017 ). We found that ants use polarised moonlight for homing throughout the lunar cycle, even on nights when the moon is crescent, when polarisation levels are at their lowest. This suggests that polarised moonlight is integrated into the ant’s path integrator for homing along the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight

The study demonstrates that nocturnal ants use polarised moonlight to navigate during the night, rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above ants alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar, even under crescent moons when polarised levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moon pattern into the ant’s path system throughout the night for homing as polarised is incorporated throughout the day.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

    Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight ( Palmer, 2017 ). The first pterosaurs, the non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base ( Frey et al., 2003 ), similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane' ( Marsh, 1882; Döderlein, 1929; Frey et al., 2003; Figure 1 ), which may have contributed to passive stability in flight

., 2003 ). The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability. However, vane fluttering would be extremely costly and destabilising unless the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load

Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF ). Three specimens - NHMUK PV OR 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and ROM VP 55352 - exhibited tail vanes under white light, but the vane of NHMUK PV OR 37003 was only visible under LSF

Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch at the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie ( Munich ), Museum für Naturkunde ( Berlin ), Jura Museum ( Eichstätt ), Natural History Museum ( London ), National Museum of Scotland ( Edinburgh ), and Royal Ontario Museum ( Toronto ) representing the pterosaur inventories in their care

., 2015; Pittman et al., 2021 ) to investigate the vane’s structural properties, explore its usage, its evolutionary origins and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids ( Frey et al., 2003 ).

. These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars, ribs, stringers, and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins, but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous ( Marsh, 1882 ), especially since their preserved appearance varies. Here, we use laser-simulated fluorescence ( LSF ) imaging of Rhamphorhynchus specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones ( Kaye et al., 2015; Pittman et al

. A primary role in display has also been suggested ( O’Brien et al., 2018 ), given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that, unlike most aircraft, flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns ( Bowers, 2016 ). The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids ( Frey et al., 2003 )

. Tail vanes feature thick, evenly spaced, internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series ( Döderlein, 1929 ), that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches ( Marsh, 1882 )

. These specimens were screened without bias regardless of their ontogenetic stage and preservation ( i. e. completeness, degree of articulation and the presence or absence of soft tissues under white light ). Out of this significant sample, only four specimens were found to preserve tail vane soft tissues, which were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF; Kaye et al., 2015 ) at the Natural History Museum, National Museum of Scotland, and the Royal Ontario Museum

. LSF confirmed the soft tissue extent of the vanes and revealed hidden anatomical details, especially in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( Figure 2A–C ), where vane areas fluoresced pink and white, indicating soft tissue preservation ( Pittman et al., 2021 ). Tail vanes are sub-symmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13

. It preserves fragments consisting of disarticulated flight apparatus and partially preserved scapula-coracoid. 11 rib-bearing dorsal vertebrae in articulation; disarticulated unfused pubic elements, both hindlimb elements with paired well-preserved tarsals in articulation. Metacarpal IV is 23 mm long. The wing phalanges make up an incomplete ~380 mm long wing ( WP1 = ~113 mm but incomplete, WP2 = ~112 mm but incomplete, WP3 = ~101 mm, WP4 = ~54 mm but incomplete )

. The vane encompasses over fifteen vertebrae and is 41 mm wide. Initially assigned to Rhamphorhynchus muensteri by Goldfuß, 1831; followed by R. gemmingi by von Meyer, 1846; then re-assessed under label Nr. 42 in Wellnhofer, 1975; cumulatively reassigned to R. muensteri by Bennett, 1995 who synonymised all Rhamphorhynchus species as different year classes of the same species. Wellnhofer already noted the faint preservation of a tail vane in his assessment

. While experiencing some deformation, the tail stems from the terminal sacrum and is fully preserved in articulation. The tail measures 348 mm, out of which ~72 mm is taken up by the tail vane. Making up 21% of the total tail length. The tail vane is ‘stockier’ in comparison to the NHMUK specimens, having a wider anterior opening and measuring 55 mm at its widest section. The vane encompasses at least 15 caudal vertebrae.

. Element of the very deformed sternum and paired scapula-coracoids are visible along with a humerus. The humerus is 39 mm long, a stocky bone with deflecting deltopectoral crest characteristic of R. muensteri. The radius is 71 mm long and fourth metacarpal is 24 mm long. The wing phalanges make up a~465 mm long wing ( WP1 = 123 mm, WP2 = ~119 mm, WP3 = ~112 mm, WP4 = 111 mm ), accumulating to a wingspan of ~1. 2 m, with the terminal phalange retaining a 165° curvature

. The total tail length is 362 mm. The vane makes up 75 mm of the tail ( 21% ) and is 41 mm at its widest point. The specimen was assessed by Wellnhofer ( pers. comm. ) and mentioned in Frey et al., 2003 for the likelihood of preserving a ‘throat pouch’. The specimen was later used in ‘tail fin’ calculations by O’Brien et al., 2018, but remained formally undescribed

., 2018, but remained formally undescribed. While retaining a well-preserved tail vane, the wing membrane, despite discolouration and topographic lineation, does not preserve actinofibrils. Keratinous terminations of rhamphotheca and unguals are also absent. The skull has a proportionally sizeable orbit while the wing phalange extensor process and pubic fusing point to a late-stage sub-adult ontogenetic stage

. 1994. 13. 1. Under LSF, partial edges of the vane are visible, along with at least 17 relatively straight structures in NHMUK PV OR 37787 ( 10+in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 11+ in NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ) ; projecting vertically, near-perpendicularly to the tail skeleton at the widest point of vane ( based on position of chevron bones e. g. NHM PV OR 37787 ), they can project down to acute angles of 57°, 65°, 66°, and 70° . The structures are 1–2 mm wide and 1–2 mm long, spaced 2–3 mm apart. The vane is subymmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHUK PV 370 and NMS.199.13.13.1 ( Figure 2A–C ). The vanes are subymmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHUK PV 370 and NMS.199.13.13.1 ( Figure 2–C ) The vanes are subymmetrical and diamond in NHUK PV 370 and NMS.199.13.1 ( Figure 2–C ) The vanes are submetrical and diamond-shaped in NHUK PV370 and NMS.199.13.1 ( Figure 2–C ) The vanes are submetrical and diamond in NHUK 370 and NMS.199.13.1 ( Figure 2– ) The van are submetrical and diamond in NHUK 370 andMS.199.13 ( Figure 2– ) The van are sub and diamond in NH 370 andMS.13 ( Figure 2 ) The van are sub and in NH370MS ( Figure 2 ) The are sub in NH370 ( Figure ) The are in 370 ( Figure The in 370 Figure The in 370 The in 370 in 370 in 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370 370

    Title: 
    Abstract: Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. 

    Supporting Text:
   . This effect is driven, in part, by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release only in adolescent male rats, through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence ( see Wahlstrom et al., 2010a; Wahlstrom et al

. Interestingly, one report using adult mice found that antagonizing GABAB receptors increased dopamine release when β2-containing nAChRs were antagonized ( Lopes et al., 2019 ), indicating that GABA and nAChRs have a potentially complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that we suggest here may be age/developmental stage dependent. In conclusion, we found that stimulated dopamine release is decreased in the NAc core of early adolescent male rats

., 2019 ) or on CINs ( Yorgason et al., 2022 ). Regardless, the small effects of GABA alone on a slice in the presence of endogenous GABA are likely independent of the α6-mediated control of dopamine release explored in the present study. Lastly, we used microdialysis in awake rats to confirm that the age-dependent differences in male dopamine release are mediated by a GABA mechanism involving α6-containing nAChRs in vivo

., 2020 ), though the mechanism responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear. Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region

. Although these transitional changes in dopamine release are implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders, much is unknown about the mechanisms driving these age-related differences. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify variations in NAc core stimulated dopamine release and pinpoint the mechanism for which these changes may occur in adolescent and adult male rats. Consistent with our previous findings ( Pitts et al

. Notably, α-Ctx mediated reductions in adolescent GABA levels are comparable to adult baseline GABA levels. Thus, blocking α6 nAChRs in adolescent rats makes GABA and dopamine signaling similar to that of adult rats at baseline in both our microdialysis and FSCV studies. Further studies are needed to understand the microcircuitry mediating the α6-containing nAChR regulation of dopamine release in adolescent rats

. Thus, we propose that for early adolescent rats ( Figure 5 ), α-Ctx blocks α6 nAChRs on GABA releasing cells to lower the influence of GABA on dopamine varicosities upon stimulation. The putative source of this GABA that expresses α6 nAChRs includes both local GABA interneurons and dopamine varicosities that co-release GABA ( Patel et al., 2024 ). This leads to disinhibition of dopamine and the elevated levels we observe only in adolescents

. Although prior research has found no difference in the density of α6-containing nAChRs in the NAc of early adolescents and adults ( Doura et al., 2008 ), differences in localization or functionality of either α6-containing nAChRs or GABA receptors may underlie changes that create this novel multisynaptic mechanism of dopamine regulation in adolescent males. Antagonizing GABAA or GABAB receptors, alone or together, did not impact dopamine release directly ( i. e

. The first is the well-documented direct blocking of α6-containing nAChRs on dopamine varicosities that decreases DA release at low-frequency stimulations ( i. e. the ‘masked’ effect in adolescents but present for adults ). The second, and novel mechanism through early adolescence we propose, is an α-Ctx mediated reduction in GABA control of dopamine release that disinhibits dopamine and is responsible for the increase that is specific to adolescent rats

. We found there were age-related effects of GABA alone on dopamine release ( prior to α-Ctx ), that were opposite that of α-Ctx, albeit with a smaller effect size. GABA decreased dopamine release in adolescent rats but increased release in adult rats ( main effect of age: F1, 44=27. 58, p<0. 0001 ) ( Figure 4G ). The effects of GABA on slice alone are not specific to the effects of α6-nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons

. However, given this lack of direct effect of GABA antagonism on dopamine release, we applied GABA on the slice to confirm the role of GABA on the α-Ctx mediated effect as discussed earlier. Overall, activation of GABA receptors using GABA alone on slice led to small, but divergent dopamine release in adolescents and adults. The mechanism for this is not known, but could be differential effects of GABA receptor sensitivity on dopamine varicosities ( Brodnik et al

. We found differences between adult and adolescent rats in modulation of NAc core dopamine release by α6- containing nAChRs, but not by α7 or non-α6 β2* nAChRs. Indeed, the application of α-Ctx ( a selective α6- containing nAChRs antagonist ) had a completely different effect on dopamine release in adults compared to early adolescent male rats

. Here, we use ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) to compare stimulated dopamine release and local circuitry regulation in the NAc core of adult and adolescent male rats. We then use microdialysis to determine the influence of other extrinsic factors in vivo in mediating developmental changes in the dopaminergic system

. If the age-related effects of α-Ctx are mediated through GABA receptors, then antagonism of GABA receptors prior to α-Ctx application should eliminate differences in dopamine release modulation between adult and adolescent rats. Application of GABAA and/or GABAB receptor antagonists, alone ( Figure 4B ) or together ( Figure 4C ), did not impact dopamine release and did not modulate dopamine release differently in adult and adolescent rats ( main effect of age: F1, 26. 121=0. 001, p=0

., 2017 ) display a similar pattern of dopamine release to adolescent rats in the present study, particularly with respect to how α6-containing nAChRs modulated dopamine release. This is an intriguing finding and may indicate that α6-containing nAChR regulation of dopamine is a biomarker for vulnerability to SUD given that adolescence is a particularly susceptible time for sensation seeking and SUD development

. This effect masks the parallel mechanism of the direct influence of acetylcholine on dopamine release via varicosities only observed in adult rats. By replacing the reduced GABA levels caused by α-Ctx directly with exogenously applied GABA, or by blocking GABA receptors, we bypass the mechanism of α-Ctx-mediated reduction in GABA and subsequent disinhibition of dopamine

. Enhancing our understanding of the transitional changes in dopamine regulation may shed light on the mechanisms driving changes in reward-related behaviors, and related increase in vulnerability, that are characteristic of adolescence.

. Given the role of local modulators in the dopamine system, variations in heterosynaptic regulation of striatal dopamine release may be responsible for the neurobiological changes seen between adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of local modulators on presynaptic NAc dopamine release of adult and adolescent male rats is the mechanism responsible for driving such developmental changes

. e. outside of α6 nAChR modulation ). In fact, prior literature on the effects of GABA antagonism on dopamine release is mixed. Some report no direct impact on dopamine release ( Pitman et al., 2014 ). However, Patel et al., 2024 recently confirmed the presence of GABA-mediated inhibition of striatal dopamine release in male rats, but did not investigate the role of α6 nChRs in this effect. Here, we show that α6 nChRs mediate GABA inhibition of dopamine release in adolescent rats, but not adult rats, and that GABA alone does not modulate dopamine release in either age group. This is the first report of α6 nChRs mediating GABAergic regulation of dopamine in the NAc of adolescent male rats, and suggests a novel mechanism of dopamine regulation unique to the period of development

We found that α6 nChRs mediate GABAergic regulation of dopamine in adolescent rats, but not adult rats, and GABA alone does not modulate dopamine in either group. This is the first report of α nChRs mediating GABA regulation of dopamine in the NAc of adolescent male, and suggests a mechanism unique to the period of development. We found that α nChRs mediate GABA regulation of dopamine in adolescent, but not adult, and G alone does not modulate dopamine in either group. This is the report of nCh mediating GABA of dopamine in the NAc adolescent, and suggests a mechanism unique to development

We found that α nCh mediate GABA of dopamine in adolescent but not adult and G alone does not modulate either. This is the report n mediating G of dopamine in the NAc adolescent and suggests a unique to development. We found that n mediate G of dopamine in adolescent but adult and alone does not modulate. This is the report mediating of dopamine in the NAc and suggests unique to development

    Title: 
    Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics, raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms. Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11. 2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In our p-proteome analyses, the ERK/MAPK and PKA pathway have also been shown to be enriched. Ultimately, altered cellular signaling seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other NDDs. Importantly, our study indicates that ASD NPCs not only have enrichment of dysregulated mTOR but that mTOR dysregulation is driving autism-associated phenotypes

. To begin addressing these questions, we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two different autism subtypes – an idiopathic cohort ( I-ASD ) and a genetically defined CNV 16p11. 2 deletion ( 16pDel ) cohort. We demonstrate remarkable convergence in neurite and migration phenotypes despite whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) showing no genetic overlap between the datasets

. Ultimately, the most striking finding is the consistent mTOR signaling differences across two genetically distinct groups of autism, a finding not previously described. To determine whether the mTOR differences described above drive the developmental abnormalities in our cohorts, we conducted gain and loss of function studies on all I-ASD and both male 16pDel NPCs

. Thus, in both ‘low-mTOR’ ASD patients, we find that increasing mTOR pathway activity ( via SC-79 ) can rescue ASD defects while reducing mTOR pathway activity ( via MK-2206 ) in the Sibs reproduces autism NPC phenotypes. Given that increasing p-S6 in our low mTOR cohort led to rescue of ASD-associated phenotypes, we next sought to determine whether decreasing p-S6 in high mTOR ASD NPCs ( ASD-2 and 16pDel ) could similarly rescue ASD NPC phenotypes

., 2017; Yan et al., 2013a ). Furthermore, by comparing two subtypes of ASD, we show, as suggested by genetics studies, that this early developmental dysregulation may be a common feature among multiple forms of ASD. Our p-proteome, westerns, and small molecule analyses identified altered mTOR signaling as a point of convergence for the shared ASD neurite and migration phenotypes

. About 10–15% of autism cases are genetically defined and caused by single gene mutations or copy number variants ( CNVs ) while most of ASD etiology remains undefined or idiopathic. Yet, much of our knowledge of ASD pathophysiology is derived from rodent studies of syndromic rare variant genes. Consequently, our insight into a majority of ASD pathophysiology has been limited and we have little knowledge of the similarities and differences between idiopathic and genetically defined autisms

. Consistent with the idea that mTOR signaling dysfunction could be a common mechanism for autism, monogenic syndromic disorders, which can exhibit ASD such as tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ), PTEN-associated ASD, and neurofibromatosis-1, have mutations that directly affect mTOR pathway components ( Enriquez-Barreto and Morales, 2016; Yeung et al., 2017; Huber et al., 2015; Dasgupta et al., 2005; Winden et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2010; Rangasamy et al

. Bioinformatics revealed the mTOR pathway as one of the strongest points of convergence between the two ASD subtypes, which was supported by western analyses. Moreover, modulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules rescued and reproduced ASD NPC phenotypes indicating that mTOR signaling defects are mechanistically linked to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes

. Nonetheless, there were also ASD subtypes as evidenced by differential responses to EFs between I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs as well as distinct mTOR alterations including elevations and reductions. Overall, our studies indicate that despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two distinct ASD subtypes have dysregulation of mTOR signaling which mediates the surprisingly uniform neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

. Manipulation of mTOR could rescue or reproduce ASD phenotypes in both low and high mTOR NPCs, indicating that tight regulation of mTOR pathway is essential for normal neural development. The above results indicate that mTOR signaling dysregulation is responsible for the shared neurodevelopmental phenotypes. However, one phenotype that diverges between I-ASD NPCs and 16pDel NPCs is responsiveness to EFs

. Our study is one of the first to show the remarkable convergence of neurodevelopmental and molecular phenotypes in two distinct autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iPSC clones and neural inductions. The extensive rigor of our analyses that included a total of 29 distinct iPSC clones and 61 distinct neural inductions lends to relatively small sample sizes ( though similar to other iPSC studies ) with only six autism probands, three of each subtype

., 2017; Waite and Eickholt, 2011 ). Given the neurodevelopmental phenotypes present in all our ASD NPCs and the impaired EF responses in I-ASD, we postulated that dysregulated signaling pathways could be an underlying mechanism. Thus, we conducted unbiased proteomic and p-proteomic studies comparing Sib and I-ASD, Sib and 16pDel, and I-ASD and 16pDel. We first analyzed the proteome and found surprisingly few changes in the I-ASD and 16pDel datasets relative to Sib

. The WNT pathway, which includes CHD8 ( an autism-related chromatin modifier ) and beta-catenin, has long been implicated in ASD pathogenesis. The WNT pathway, much like mTOR, is thought to regulate neuronal proliferation and has been associated with macrocephalic phenotypes seen in ASD. For example, a study by Marchetto et al. found that NPCs derived from individuals with macrocephaly and I-ASD displayed excessive proliferation as well as altered WNT signaling

. In summary, we have found that two genetically distinct ASD cohorts have surprisingly common dysregulation in two early neurodevelopmental processes, neurite outgrowth and cell migration. Given the marked heterogeneity of ASD, these results are striking and potentially suggest that common mechanisms regulate these neurodevelopmental defects. Few iPSC studies have explored the roles of EFs in regulating human NPC development

. 2 deletion CNV. The CNV deletes 28 genes, increases autism risk by ~20-fold, and is one of the most common ASD-associated mutations ( Weiss et al., 2008; Niarchou et al., 2019; Qureshi et al., 2014 ). This cohort consists of three individuals, two males ( 16pDel M-1, 16pDel M-2 ) and one female ( 16pDel F ). For sex-matched controls, we selected three iPSC lines from the NIH Regenerative Medicine Program ( NIH )

. In turn, this heterogeneity raises the possibility that there are ‘different’ ASD subtypes ( Ousley and Cermak, 2014; Eaves et al., 1994; Beglinger and Smith, 2001 ). Yet, despite this heterogeneity, all autism subtypes are united by their core behavioral phenotypes. Consequently, we postulate that there may be common pathways linking different autism subtypes. Yet, few studies have compared multiple ASD subtypes to investigate possible commonalities

. We were only able to detect our remarkably convergent mTOR deficits and alterations in signaling by utilizing p-proteomics and studying cellular signaling through western blotting, further indicating that ASD could be a disorder of intracellular signaling

. Recently altered NPC development has also been identified as a consistent neurodevelopmental phenotype for numerous ASD risk genes ( Garcia-Forn et al., 2020 ). Given that human iPSC-derived NPCs are similar transcriptionally and functionally to cortical NPCs, our studies provide experimental evidence of NPC developmental dysregulation in ASD ( Hofrichter et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2013a )

. Furthermore, by changing Sib control p-S6 to ASD levels, the neurodevelopmental defects could be reproduced demonstrating that the mTOR signaling differences are mechanistically linked to the shared neurodevelopmental defects for both I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs

. Surprisingly, our EF studies revealed that all unaffected NPCs responded to selected EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration while I-ASD NPCs failed to respond to any of the EFs tested. Our results indicate that mTOR dysregulation mediates the neurodevelopmental phenotypes in both ASD subtypes despite the genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic differences between IAS and 16Del

Our study is one of the first to show the convergence of neurodevelopment and molecular phenotypes in two autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iPSC clones and neural inductions. The rigor of our analyses included a total of 29 iPSC clones and 61 neural inductions lending to small sample sizes though similar to other iP studies with only six probands, three each. The neurodevelopment phenotypes present in all ASD and impaired responses to EF in IAS suggest that dysregulated signaling could be an underlying mechanism. Thus, we conducted unbiased proteomic and pte studies comparing Sib IAS and 16Del and IAS and 16Del. We analyzed the proteome and surprisingly few changes in IAS and 16Del relative to S

The WNT pathway which includes CHD an autism-related chromatin modifier and beta-caten has been implicated in pathogenesis. WNT like mTOR is thought to regulate proliferation and associated with macroceph phenotypes in ASD. For example, study by Marchetto found NPCs from individuals with macroaly IAS displayed excessive proliferation and altered W signaling. In summary, we found two distinct ASD cohorts common dysreg in early neurodevelopment processes neurite out and migration Given heterogeneity of ASD these results are striking and suggest common mechanisms regulate neurodevelopment defects Few iP studies explored roles EF in human development.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

   . We performed paired IHC and SGN bouton recordings in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SGN characterization. This approach tightly controls IHC Ca2+ influx and records the postsynaptic SGN response to glutamate release at a single afferent synapse

Next to providing support for the presynaptic hypothesis of functional SGN diversity, the present study also highlights some of the challenges met when aiming to bridge the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding

., 2017 ), heterogeneity exists even among auditory synapses formed by an individual presynaptic inner hair cell ( IHC ) with its 5–30 postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs, reviews in Gómez-Casati and Goutman, 2021; Meyer and Moser, 2010; Moser, 2020; Reijntjes and Pyott, 2016 ). Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate mechanism for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information ( Grant et al., 2010; Meyer et al

. Next, we compared the physiology of afferent synapses with high and low SR by adapting stimulation protocols routinely employed for in vivo characterization of sound encoding by SGNs. We used step depolarizations to emulate physiological receptor potentials given that mature IHCs of the ‘high-frequency’ mouse cochlea have graded receptor potentials that primarily represent the rectified envelope of an acoustic stimulus ( i. e. the DC component; Russell and Sellick, 1978 ).

., 2001; Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2014 ). Certainly, caution is to be applied for the comparison of ex vivo and in vivo data due to the partial disruption of the physiological milieu despite our efforts to maintain near-physiological conditions, and the incomplete synaptic maturation when focusing ex vivo experiments on the third postnatal week soon after hearing onset. Clearly more work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea

., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021 ). The low voltage of activation of release at pillar synapses shown ex vivo could underly the high SR and low sound threshold of firing of SGNs found in vivo but direct demonstration of such a link has been missing. Here, we aimed to bridge the gap between ex vivo presynaptic physiology and in vivo SGN neurophysiology

. In addition, we found stronger synaptic depression at high SR synapses, which agrees well with the finding of a greater ratio of peak to adapted firing rate in high SR SGNs recorded in vivo ( Taberner and Liberman, 2005 ). These results support the hypothesis that IHC synaptic heterogeneity ( Frank et al., 2009; Hua et al., 2021; Ohn et al., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021; Reijntjes et al., 2020 ) contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN firing

. The auditory system harbors striking examples of synaptic diversity. Glutamatergic ribbon synapses in the cochlea, calyceal synapses in the brainstem, and bouton synapses throughout the central auditory system differ greatly from each other ( Moser et al., 2006; Wichmann and Kuner, 2022 ). Beyond the diversity across synapses formed by different neurons and at different places ( e. g. different regions of the brain or frequency [tonotopic] places of the cochlea; Johnson et al

., 2018; Sun et al., 2018 ). Yet, it has remained challenging to demonstrate a causal link of a candidate mechanism to the physiological SGN diversity. One common approach has been to capitalize on a pioneering study that employed in vivo labeling of physiologically characterized SGNs in cats and proposed that synapses formed by low and high SR SGNs segregate on the basal IHC pole ( Liberman, 1982 )

. Using the rate of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( rate of sEPSCs, SR ) as a surrogate for SGN SR, we demonstrate that high SR synapses have larger and more compact sEPSCs as well as lower voltage thresholds, shorter latencies of evoked EPSCs ( eEPSCs ), tighter Ca2+ channel coupling to vesicle release, and higher initial release rates. 90% of these high SR synapses were located on the pillar side of the IHC

. In IHCs, this is particularly important for sound intensity and temporal coding ( reviewed in Moser et al., 2023 ). Interestingly, genetic disruptions that shifted the voltage dependence had a greater impact on the in vivo distribution of SR and onset firing rate of SGNs than mutations that changed the maximal synaptic Ca2+ influx ( Jean et al., 2018; Ohn et al., 2016 )

., 1990 ). Decades of in vivo recordings from single SGNs have demonstrated functional diversity of SGNs with comparable frequency tuning, i. e., receiving input from IHCs at a given tonotopic place or potentially even the same IHC. Such functional diversity is present in both spontaneous and sound-evoked firing. The spontaneous firing rate ( SR ) in the absence of sound varies from less than 1 spikes/s to more than 100 spikes/s ( Barbary, 1991; Evans, 1972; Kiang et al

., 2010; Meyer et al., 2009; Ohn et al., 2016; Özçete and Moser, 2021 ). For example, the cochlea might use heterogeneous afferent synapses to break down sound intensity information into complementary spike rate codes of SGNs that have been reported along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea for several species ( Huet et al., 2016; Kiang et al., 1965; Sachs and Abbas, 1974; Taberner and Liberman, 2005; Winter et al., 1990 )

Chemical synapses represent diverse and plastic neural contacts that are adapted to the specific needs of neural computation. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a given circuit and even within the same neuron ( recent reviews in Nusser, 2018; Wichmann and Kuner, 2022 ). Synaptic diversity occurs at various levels: from synapse shape and size, to the ultrastructure of pre- and postsynaptic specializations, to their molecular composition

. Our findings suggest that synaptic heterogeneity accounts for much of the SGN firing diversity at a given tonotopic position.

. Ideally, future studies will combine in vivo and ex vivo experiments, such as combining physiological SGN characterization with neural backtracing and synaptic morphology of labeled SGNs using volume imaging of afferent and efferent connectivity ( Hua et al., 2021 ). Moreover, combining optogenetic IHC stimulation with imaging of SGN activity could provide higher throughput and serve post hoc morphology

. High SR SGNs preferentially contacted the pillar side of the IHC ( facing pillar cells ), while low SR SGNs synapsed on the opposite, modiolar side of the IHC ( facing the cochlear modiolus ). Interestingly, a segregation has also been found for afferent and efferent synaptic properties, as well as molecular and morphological differences between the two sides of the IHC ( Moser et al,2006; Petoldt et al,202 ). Synaptic heterogeneity in IHC contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at different tonopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information ( Grant et al,2010; Meyer et al.202 ) Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate for the cochlea decom acoustic information Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate how the cochlea decom acoustic Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea is a candidate for the cochlea acoustic Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea a candidate for the cochlea Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea a candidate Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea Synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic the Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic Synaptic in the cochlea Synaptic Synaptic the Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic Synaptic

    Title: 
    Abstract: The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

   . However, the genome-wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive. In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance

Despite intensive investigations on the dynamic nature of the Plasmodium chromatin, progress has been slow in capturing the regulatory factors that maintain and control chromatin structure and gene expression throughout parasite development. Preliminary studies performed by our lab and others have identified PfMORC as one of the most abundant chromatin-bound proteins ( Singh et al., 2021a; Zhong et al., 2023 )

. Given the multifunctional role of MORC proteins throughout apicomplexan parasites, we further explored the association of PfMORC with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific gene regulation by assessing the genome-wide distribution of PfMORC using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP–seq ) in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages

. Conflicting results on the essentiality of PfMORC using either KD or KO strategies remained unresolved ( Singh et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have determined the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of PfMORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development

. We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. Disparities observed in the essentiality of PfMORC for the parasite survival in previous studies ( Singh et al

. When PfMORC was downregulated, a level of H3K9me3 was detected at a lower level, demonstrating a possible role of this protein in epigenetic regulation and gene repression. Finally, Hi-C analyses demonstrate that downregulation of PfMORC results in significant dysregulation of chromatin architectural stability resulting in parasite death

. falciparum possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors ( TFs ) encoded in the Plasmodium genome ( Coulson et al., 2004; Balaji et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2008; Yuda et al

. All together our work-demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation, PfMORC may act as a potential repressor to control a set of parasite-specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion, and antigenic variation between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition ( Shang et al., 2022 )

. Moreover, punctuates were shown to have strong colocalization signals with histone H3K9me3 marks present at the different parasite developmental stages analyzed. This was most evident during the early ring stage of the parasite IDC where the chromatin organization is more compact with a single DNA copy. Altogether, our findings indicated that PfMORC is a true nuclear protein that is most likely associated with P. falciparum heterochromatin cluster ( s )

., 1998; Scherf et al., 1998 ). Data generated at 36 hpi in ( - ) aTC PfMORC parasite cultures were, however, tumultuous, with a decrease in defined heterochromatin borders and fewer long-range intrachromosomal interactions across the genome. This may indicate a significant loss of chromatin maintenance in ( - ) aTC PfMORC parasites ( Figure 6a–b ). To pinpoint which regions were most strongly affected by the knockdown of PfMORC, we used Selfish ( Ardakany et al

. Among the other AP2s detected, five were previously identified by ChIP-seq as Plasmodium falciparum AP2 Heterochromatin-associated Factors ( PfAP2-HFs ) ( Shang et al., 2022 ). Our findings, corroborated with several published works, indicate that PfMORC interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions

To characterize the role of PfMORC in P. falciparum, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to add a 3 X-HA tag at the C-terminal coding region of the Pfmorc locus ( PF3D7_1468100 ) in an NF54 line ( Ganesan et al., 2016, Figure 1a, Supplementary file 1 )

. Inspection of PfMORC binding sites across each chromosome revealed a strong signal for telomeric and subtelomeric regions of the parasite genome, as well as the internal clusters of genes responsible for antigenic variation such as var and rifin ( Figure 2a–c, Supplementary file 4 ). We found that while only 47% of reads mapped to antigenic genes in the ring stage, 95% of reads mapped to the same genes during the trophozoite stage and 82% during the schizont stage

. Recently, ChEP experiments done in P. falciparum identified PfMORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle ( IDC ) ( Batugedara et al., 2020 ). PfMORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle, including sporozoites and liver stages ( Farhat et al., 2020; Singh et al

. Using the downregulation of PfMORC induced through the TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of PfMORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence-based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that PfMORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near var genes with significant overlap with well-known signatures of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification ( PTM ) H3K9-trimethylation ( H3K9me3 ) marks

. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, Plasmodium has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins, or regulate chromatin structure ( Bozdech et al., 2003b; Le Roch et al., 2003; Bozdech et al., 2003a; Srinivasan et al., 2004; Silvestrini et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2021 )

. We next sought to analyze the effect of PfMORC down-regulation on the global chromatin landscape. We, therefore, performed a ChIP-seq experiment against histone H3K9me3 and H3K9ac marks in response to PfMORC depletion. Synchronized parasites were equally split between permissive and repressive conditions

., 2020; Subudhi et al., 2023; Bryant et al., 2020 ), including this work. Protein pull-down experiments in Plasmodium spp. and T. gondii studies have detected MORC in complexes with several AP2 TFs. In T. gondii, TgMORC was characterized as an upstream transcriptional repressor of sexual commitment ( Farhat et al. 2018 ). In contrast, PfMOR was found to be associated with AP2 TFs involved in heterochatin formation and gene silencing, such as PfAP1 and PfAP2 ( Shang et al. 202 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running ). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.

   . While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior. Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior.

., 2022; Torres-Rodriguez et al., 2024 ). This connection occurs independently of pain, and this cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. While the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, it also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients

. The absence of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing animals, however, decreased cFos and ΔFosB in the PBN, and ΔFosB in the SpVc ( Figure 4B and C ). Other tested regions were not impacted ( Figure 4D ). These data suggest that the tumor-brain communication was disrupted in the absence of nociceptor neurons. To evaluate the effects of this disruption on cancer-induced behavioral changes, we assessed the animals’ general well-being through nesting behavior ( Neely et al

. Even with these constraints, our findings are important. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit. This circuit extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways

. Cancer patients, and even more notably, survivors, experienced poor mental health ( Carreira et al., 2018; Niedzwiedz et al., 2019; Utley et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2021 ). The neural connection between tumor and brain, together with our finding that TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons within this circuit become functionally altered, might contribute to these changes

. Since both drugs were given systemically and each only partially restored wheel running, it suggests that systemic inflammation alone cannot fully account for the decline in wheel running seen in vehicle-treated animals. We posit that the inflammation- and pain-independent component of this behavioral decline is mediated via the transcriptional and functional alterations in the cancer-brain circuit. This suggests that factors beyond pain contribute to the observed behavioral changes

. These findings suggest that choosing pain management drugs in the context of cancer can potentially influence tumor growth adversely. Furthermore, the data reveal that behaviors associated with the tumor site are adversely affected by cancer-associated pain. Pain-induced anhedonia is mediated by changes in the reward pathway. Specifically, in the context of pain, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) become less responsive to pain and release less serotonin

. Since HNSCC tumors cause oral pain and both nesting and the cookie test require the use of the mouth, we also evaluated the effect of nociceptor ablation on voluntary wheel running to gain additional insights into cancer-associated fatigue, a surrogate for depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice ( Norden et al., 2015a; Zombeck et al., 2013; Grossberg et al., 2018; Bower et al., 2011; Norden et al., 2015b )

., 2021; Tsaras et al., 2018 ). The association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease, its treatment or both; these findings suggest that the development of a tumor alters brain functions. We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC; Madeo et al., 2018 ), melanoma ( Balood et al., 2022 ), cervical ( Lucido et al., 2019 ), and ovarian cancers ( Barr et al., 2021 )

. These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior. Cancer pain often interferes with activities that don't involve oral movements, a phenomenon evident in the impaired voluntary wheel running observed in tumor-bearing mice

., 2022 ) and opioids ( Le Merrer et al., 2009 ) directly influence reward processing and though our tracing studies did not indicate that the tumor-brain circuit includes the VTA, this brain region may be indirectly impacted by tumor-induced pain in the oral cavity

. These control studies indicate that the nerve density and distribution present in the tumor bed are higher than in control mice, with the consequence that a small volume ( 2 μl instead of 10 µl ) of tracer is sufficient to result in nerve labeling. The mapped circuit encompasses pre-existing connections to brain areas that regulate pain and affect ( Yeh et al., 2018; Hu, 2016; Zhu et al., 2022; Russo and Nestler, 2013 )

. We aimed to ensure the specificity of capturing only tumor-infiltrating nerves, which meant sacrificing the comprehensiveness of labeling all nerves associated with the tumor. This constraint extends to our calcium imaging studies and brain tracing. Although we can confidently assert that all labeled neurons are indeed tumor-infiltrating or connected, we cannot conclusively state that all tracer-negative ipsilateral nerves are unconnected to the tumor-brain circuit

. Although in its early stages, our insight into the role of nerves in cancer is growing and highlighting neuronal targets for pharmacological interventions. Our study is not exempt from limitations. First, our exploration of the tumor-to-brain pathway was confined to mice with HNSCC and used a single cancer cell line. Hence, the universality of our conclusions warrants verification through additional HNSCC cell lines and diverse cancer models

., 2019 ) and anhedonia using the cookie test ( Liu et al., 2018; Eliwa et al., 2021 ), as well as body weight and food disappearance as surrogates for oral pain and/or loss of appetite. Nociceptor-neuron-ablated mice showed increased nesting performance ( Figure 4E ) and decreased anhedonia ( Figure 4F ) compared to intact mice. This was accompanied by smaller tumor growth ( Figure 4G ) and increased survival ( Figure 4H )

. This underscores the complex interplay between sensory neurons, cancer progression, and mental health, uncovering a two-pronged approach to improving HNSCC patients’ physical and psychological health. In melanoma ( Balood et al., 2022 ) and HNSCC, we demonstrated significant alterations in transcript levels within tumor-infiltrating nerves. Several mechanisms can account for these changes

. While baseline fluorescence was similar between tumor-bearing and control animals, that recorded upon stimulation ( KCl; 30 mM ) was significantly higher in neurons of tumor-bearing animals ( Figure 3G, H, I and J, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3 ). These functional and Fos staining data indicate that central neurons within the tumor-brain circuit are functionally altered compared to their healthy brain counterparts

. The human experience with cancer is distinct from that of mouse models; individuals can live with malignant growths for extended periods, often unaware of their existence due to asymptomatic or nonspecific symptoms. During this undiagnosed period, the tumor-brain circuit might induce irreversible changes in central neurons through activity-dependent transcriptional modifications ( Yap and Greenberg, 2018; Takayanagi-Kiya and Kiya, 2019 )

., 2022 ). A study utilizing a different syngeneic model of oral cancer similarly found an immune suppressive role for CGRP ( McIlvried et al., 2022 ). These studies demonstrate that neuro-immune interactions occur at the tumor bed. Our current findings indicating that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to a circuit that includes regions within the brain suggest that neuro-immune interactions within the peripheral malignancy may contribute to the behavioral alterations we studied

., 2011 ). First, we confirmed the absence of TRPV1+ neurons in the TGM of these ablated animals ( Figure 4A ). Fos immunostaining of brains from nociceptor ablated and control ( C57BL/6 ) mice show no difference in Δos in the PBN ( Figure 4B ) and Δos in the Spc ( Figure 4C ), but Δos in other regions ( Figure 4D ). These data indicate that the absence of nociceor neurons disrupts the tumor-brain circuit

Our results suggest that tumor-infiltrating nerves contribute to cancer-associated changes in behavior through a pain-independent mechanisms. The presence of nociceor neurons in the tumor-brain is associated with increased Fos and Δos in the PBN and Δos in the Spc. The elimination of these neurons decreased Fos and Δos in the P and Δos in the Sp, indicating that nocice neurons play a critical role in the tumor-brain circuit.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

   . This suggests that the charge properties and phosphorylation, like polarity and hydrophobicity, of the equivalent IDR sub-regions are functional biophysical constraints maintained across related coronaviruses despite little sequence conservation. Unfortunately, it is impossible to express and experimentally characterize biophysical properties of all mutant species

. In the present work we computationally evaluate the range of several biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum, as well as related coronaviruses

. The extensive genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 presents an opportunity to probe how sequence diversity impacts these biophysical properties, and to examine what biophysical constraints exist for viral proteins to support viability. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 N-protein we have studied the diversity of biophysical phenotypes with the goal to increase understanding of salient mechanisms of the many N-protein functions, and also to glean aspects of the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution

. In complementary biophysical experiments with several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we characterize their variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and LLPS propensity. We find that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties.

This endows viral protein IDRs with yet another level of variation of the biophysical phenotype that can impact evolutionary fitness. Exploiting the emerging mutational landscape and sequence space presents both a challenge and opportunity to explore the biophysical phenotype spectrum and thereby to uncover the salient functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.

., 2011; Chin et al., 2022; Ho and Huang, 2022; Lin et al., 2017; Riback et al., 2017 ). The goal of the present work is to probe the phenotypic diversity with respect to several biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ( N- ) protein, taking advantage of the vast mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2. N-protein is the most abundant viral protein in the infected cell ( Finkel et al., 2021 ), and as we reported previously ( Zhao et al

. The distinct physicochemical properties of the linker and C-arm sub-segments persist throughout the mutant spectrum, which suggests these constitute biophysical constraints for functional SARS-CoV-2 N-protein. Therefore, we asked whether this holds true for N-protein from related coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 ( P59595. 1 ), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS, YP_009047211. 1 ), murine hepatitis virus ( MHV, NP_045302. 1 ), human coronavirus NL63 ( Q6Q1R8

They also highlight the difficulty of assigning variant properties and fitness effects to a single mutation, given the entangled effects among the sets of multiple mutations defining the variants of concern. In summary, the importance of IDRs in viral evolution was recognized previously for several reasons. Their inherent flexibility makes them more permissible for amino acid changes, which is born out in the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2

., 2022 ). Biophysical constraints implicit in the shape of such landscapes are key to understand the function and molecular evolution of viral proteins ( Starr and Thornton, 2016; Wang et al., 2021 ). Unfortunately, the wealth of genomic information on SARS-CoV-2 stands in stark contrast with our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of sequence mutations

., 2022; Savastano et al., 2020 ). Finally, here we have observed the ability of mutations in IDRs to modulate overall biophysical properties such as thermal stability, oligomeric state, and assembly properties. In SARS-CoV-2 N-protein IDRs, the latter are mediated via weak interactions in transiently folded structures. In addition, the high flexibility of the IDRs and their resulting high intra-chain contact frequencies ( Botova et al

. These nonlocal features are also maintained in analogous consensus sequence regions of related coronaviruses, and thus provide further examples for nonlocal biophysical properties that are evolutionary conserved despite amino acid sequence divergence ( Zarin et al., 2017; Zarin et al., 2021 )

. We selected conspicuous mutations in variants of concern, but each of the constructs studied also represents in itself viable N-protein species occurring in consensus sequences of the genomic database. Strikingly, point mutations can affect protein properties on all levels of organization, from thermodynamic stability and secondary structure to intra- and inter-molecular interactions, oligomeric state, particle formation, and LLPS

. Even though it is unclear to what extent IDRs of other coronaviruses can be phosphorylated, their amino acid composition would provide similar potential as SARS-CoV-2, as the completely phosphorylated charges of all peptides follow closely those of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3B )

., 2011; Hagai et al., 2014; Mihalič et al., 2023 ), and as we have shown recently, the sequence space of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein IDRs allows presentation of a large fraction of known eukaryotic SLiMs ( Schuck and Zhao, 2023 ). In addition, nonlocal sequence-distributed physicochemical features of IDRs such as their charge and hydrophobicity have been demonstrated recently to mediate biological functions and present evolutionary constraints ( Moses et al., 2023; Zarin et al., 2021 )

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has motivated the collection of virus genomic sequences on an unprecedented scale, which has generated invaluable data on the genomic diversity of an RNA virus. From the ensemble of observed consensus sequences of infected hosts, we can extract, for the first time, an exhaustive map of possible amino acid replacements in viral proteins that are tolerable for viable virus ( Bloom et al., 2023; Saldivar-Espinoza et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022 )

. On one hand, our studies of the diversity of nonlocal physicochemical properties of N-protein revealed the absence of tightly controlled hydrophobicity, polarity, and charges outside the folded domains. In the IDRs, individual mutations may alter each of these properties apparently without impacting viability, although modulatory fitness effects may be possible. For example, viable linker sequences span from 4. 8 to 9. 1 charges

. Similarly, the properties of the equivalent C-arm and subdivision of C-arm1 and N3 peptides for SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and MHV ( red symbols ) closely track the values from the mutant spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, although this is not the case for the more distant NL63 and APD51511. 1 ( gray symbols ). Charge properties of related coronaviruses follow a similar pattern of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3A ), although with somewhat greater differences, particularly again for NL63 and APD51511. 1

. Similar patterns, although with some divergence, are observed for the NL63 and APD51511. 1 IDRs ( gray pentagrams and diamonds, respectively ) which have the least sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. Polarity values ( Figure 2A ) of all coronavirus linker peptides are higher than either their corresponding FL, NTD, or CTD regions

. However, as mentioned above, the differences between IDR regions that appear associated with biophysical functions are of significantly larger magnitude. The tolerance for the remaining comparatively smaller fluctuations in physicochemical parameters may be important to allow sufficient local variation in sequence space for additional functions to evolve, such as the emergence of SLiMs to manipulate the host/virus interface ( Davey et al., 2011; Schuck and Zhao, 2023 )

The biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein IDRs, such as thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligom state, assembly, and LLPS, can be modulated by point mutations in the IDRs ( Figure 4 ). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, mutations in IDRs can create a new protein-protein interface in the N-terminus through the P13 mutation ( Figure 5 ), and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligom state, assembly, and LLPS ( Figure 4 ). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, mutations in IDRs can create a new protein-protein interface in the N-termin through the P13 mutation ( Figure 5 ) and modulate thermodynamic, secondary, oligom state, assembly, and LLPS ( Figure 4 ) In the case of SARS-2, mutations in ID can create a protein-protein in the N-termin through the P mutation and modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig state, assembly, and LL ( Figure 4 ) In the case SARS-2, mutations ID can create protein in the N-termin through P and modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig state, assembly, and LL ( Figure 4 In the case SARS-2, mutations can create protein in the N-termin P and modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig, assembly, and LL ( Figure 4 In the S-2, mutations can create in the Ntermin P and modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig, assembly, and ( Figure 4 the S-, mutations can in the Ntermin modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig, assembly, and ( Figure the S- can in N modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig, assembly, ( the can N modulate thermodynamic, secondary, olig, ( can modulate thermodynamic, secondary, ( modulate therm, secondary, ( modulate, secondary ( mod, ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod ( mod (

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.

    To investigate whether resting myosin DRX and SRX states and their respective ATP consumption rates were altered during hibernation, we utilized the loaded Mant-ATP chase assay in isolated permeabilized muscle fibers from U. arctos obtained during either summer ( active period ) or winter ( hibernating period ). A total of 104 myofibers were tested at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C )

. Our results of higher ATP consumption during torpor ( and IBA ) could, at first glance, be seen as counter-intuitive but is an indication of adaptation to the myosin protein during hibernating periods. It was therefore essential to investigate if these changes were also observed at a lower temperature, more relevant to the actual temperature of skeletal muscle in small hibernators during hibernation ( Cooper et al., 2012 ). A critical difference between the large hibernators, U

. americanus. A representative decay of the Mant-ATP fluorescence in single muscle fibers is shown ( Figure 1G ). We found very similar results to the U. arctos that in both type I and type II muscle fibers, with no changes to resting myosin conformation, ATP turnover time or ATP consumption per fiber. These data indicate that myosin metabolic states are unchanged during hibernation in both U. arctos and U. americanus. In smaller hibernators we utilized samples obtained from E

. Hence, in the present study, we hypothesized that a remodeling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation. A recent study on I. tridecemlineatus cardiac muscle supports this hypothesis, finding higher proportions of SRX during torpor ( Toepfer et al., 2020 ). We examined isolated skeletal myofibers extracted from both small and large hibernating mammals - I

., 1990; Sylow et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have uncovered some specific metabolic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation ( Giroud et al., 2020 ). For example, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as well as a suppression of ATP production capacity, has previously been documented in skeletal muscles from I. tridecemlineatus during torpor ( James et al., 2013 )

. Essential to our findings were the simultaneous observations that these cold induced changes in myosin ATP turnover times in each resting myosin state were not observed in I. tridecemlineatus samples obtained during torpor. I. tridecemlineatus and other similar small hibernators require a significant reduction in their body temperature to survive during winter periods ( Cooper et al., 2012; Christian et al., 2014 )

. In contrast, during torpor lowering the temperature had opposite effects ( Figure 4C, D and E ). This observation was particularly prominent in type II muscle fibers ( Figure 4C and D ). From these results, we suggest that I. tridecemlineatus reduce their resting myosin ATP turnover rates in response to cold exposure to increase heat production via ATP hydrolysis

. Thick filament length, measured here by the spacing of the M6 reflection ( Figure 3A ), was significantly greater in IBA compared to SA, and during torpor compared to both SA and IBA ( Figure 3E ). Taken together we report a unique structural signature of muscle during hibernating periods in I. tridecemlineatus. To mimic the drastic body temperature decrease experienced by small hibernators during torpor, we repeated the loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments in I. tridecemlineatus at 8 °C

., 2021 ). Taken together, we believe that the aberrant PTMs and/or protein expression remodeling do play a role in modifying the myosin filament stability and this all may be triggered by the well-known decreased tension on sarcomeres during hibernation ( Linari et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2018b ). Our findings suggest ATP turnover adaptations in DRX and SRX myosin states occur in small hibernators like I. tridecemlineatus during hibernation and cold exposure

. In contrast, larger mammals like U. arctos and U. americanus show no such changes, likely due to their stable body temperature during hibernation. This supports our hypothesis that myosin serves as a non-shivering thermogenesis regulator in mammals, a mechanism inhibited during torpor.

. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, the ATP turnover time of relaxed myosin molecules ( in both DRX and SRX conformations ) is faster during torpor ( and IBA ), especially in type II muscle fibers, leading to an unexpected overall increased ATP consumption

. arctos, a species in which myosin metabolic states are unaffected by hibernation ( Figure 1 ). In this context, minimal changes in phosphorylated or acetylated residues were observed in the Myh7 and Myh2 proteins ( Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2 ). These minimal modifications occurred on amino acids distinct from those in I. tridecemlineatus ( Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2 )

. Overall, our PTM analyses and related simulations indicate that torpor is associated with a Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation possibly impacting myosin filament backbone stability in I. tridecemlineatus. In addition to PTMs, myosin binding partners and/or surrounding proteins may change during torpor and may contribute to disruptions of myosin metabolic states in I. tridecemlineatus. We performed an untargeted global proteomics analysis on isolated muscle fibers

. To complement these results, we performed profiling of core metabolite and lipid contents within the myofibers of I. tridecemlineatus. Lipid measurements were significantly lower during IBA, and torpor compared to SA ( e. g. omega-6 and omega-7 fatty acids – Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ), in line with previous studies ( Otis et al., 2011 ). Untargeted global proteomics analysis was performed in U. arctos where myosin metabolic states are preserved during hibernation ( Figure 1 )

. tridecemlineatus, E. quercinus, U. arctos, and U. americanus. We employed a multifaceted approach: loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments to assess myosin conformation and ATP turnover time, X-ray diffraction for sarcomere structure evaluation, and proteomic analyses to quantify differential PTMs.

., 2023 ). This is consistent with our X-ray diffraction experiments where M6 spacing was found to be greater during torpor and is indicative of a unique structural configuration of the thick filament during hibernation ( Ma and Irving, 2022 ). Besides PTMs, another potential cause of the myosin metabolic remodeling may be changes to myofibrillar protein expression. Our global untargeted proteomics analysis reveals that I

Interestingly, lowering the temperature decreased DRX and SRX-linked ATP turnover times during active periods ( in SA and IBA ) and tor ( IBA ) in type II muscle fibers by 77–107 ( Figure 4C and D ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

   . In this study, we analyze the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plate of mice. Intriguingly, we found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that, in turn, give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis

Chondrocyte columns are a hallmark of growth plate architecture that, in turn, drives bone elongation. In this work, we studied column formation by analyzing the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice, using a modified version of 3D MAPs ( Rubin et al., 2021 ). Addressing the three criteria for a column, we found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate

. Here, we discovered that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is rare in the embryonic growth plate. Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate, as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors

. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development, while highlighting the imperative role of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements.

. These morphological entities correlate with the temporal dynamics of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development ( Figure 7 ). Column formation is commonly viewed as a key morphogenetic process during bone elongation

., 2023 ). Without integrating these aspects into a comprehensive study, it is difficult to confirm the existence of clonal columns and determine whether they are formed by cells that have undergone complete division plane rotation. Additionally, it is plausible that the clusters we identified intercalate in a manner that forms geometric non-clonal columns. This could explain the columnar arrangement of chondrocytes observed in histological sections of the growth plate

To date, a comprehensive 3D analysis of column formation in the mouse embryonic growth plate has not been performed. To address this gap, we conducted multicolor clonal lineage tracing on proximal tibia and distal femur growth plates of Col2a1-CreER:R26R-Confetti embryos. Labeled cellular clones were subjected to 3D morphometric analysis using our previously reported 3D MAPs pipeline ( Rubin et al., 2021; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Recombination was induced at E14

. Elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal axis due to incomplete rotations during cell divisions might be the cellular strategy that enables growth plate expansion in the embryo. In line with this idea, disruption of cell polarity, which leads to more incomplete division plane rotations, causes bone widening ( Rubin et al., 2021; Ahrens et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2011; Aszodi et al., 2003; Kuss et al

., 1997; Li et al., 2015 ). Changes in chondrocyte morphology, proliferation, and matrix secretion may also play important roles in this process; however, their exact contributions to embryonic bone elongation are unclear. As the cellular entity that regulates bone growth and morphology, the growth plate must balance between different requirements and constraints while performing its functions

. Our finding that embryonic clones did not exhibit typical cell stacking characteristic of columns raised the question of their contribution to bone elongation. Atypically stacked cells, with elevation angles less than 60°, could still support longitudinal growth if the clones have elongated morphologies along the P-D axis of the growth plate

. Our discovery that during embryogenesis, when bone elongation is at its highest, the growth plates contain only few columns, contradicts previous studies and reveals the need to reconsider the underlying mechanisms. Several possibilities could explain these differences

., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2023 ). Our findings of two distinct morphologies of postnatal clones and non-stereotypic stacking patterns in embryonic growth plate clones raised the question of the rotational threshold that is required to maintain a columnar structure. To determine the rotation between pairs of cells, we assumed that the final orientation is dictated by the division plane rotation ( Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2023 )

. Overall, these findings establish a new model for column formation and provide a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation and expansion during development.

. However, in the postnatal growth plate clones, the rate of complete cell rotations increases, leading to the formation of complex columns through a combination of stereotypical and non-stereotypic cell stacking, as well as of small, orthogonally oriented clusters. Additionally, we observed that column formation is buffered, permitting deviations of up to 60% incomplete rotations between successive cells within columns

., 2011; Aszodi et al., 2003; Kuss et al., 2014 ), whereas recent simulation of the growth plate predicted that lack of rotation during cell division causes the bone to expand in width ( Yokoyama et al., 2024 ). Later, during postnatal stages, bone expansion decreases dramatically while longitudinal growth is maintained. Correlating with this change in growth strategy is the appearance of columns in the center of the growth plate and small orthogonal clusters on the edges

. Having found that embryonic clones do not meet the criteria for columns, we proceeded to analyze the 3D clonal structure in postnatal growth plates. For that, we used the same pipeline ( Rubin et al., 2021 ) to analyze proximal tibia and distal femur growth plates from clonally labeled Col2a1-CreER:R26R-Confetti mice ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) at P40, 10 days after Cre induction

. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of column formation and the function of bone elongation may be regulated by this organization of clusters into geometric non-clonal columns, or increase in cell volume. The latter has been shown to be a major driver of longitudinal bone growth ( Rubin et al., 2021; Breur et al., 1991; Wilsman et al., 2008; Wilsman et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 2013; Breur et al., 1997; Li et al., 2015 )

. Recombination was induced at E14. 5 and 4 days later, chondrocyte clones were observed in all growth plate zones ( Figure 1A–C ). In 2D optical sections from both femur and tibia, cells within the clones appeared neatly stacked, forming a column-like structure parallel to the P-D bone axis ( Figure 1B and C ). However, 3D examination revealed no columnar organization and cells that were rarely stacked neatly ( Figure 1D and E, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and Figure 1—videos 1–11 )

. Our finding that the majority of embryonic clones formed clusters perpendicular to the P-D axis and that columns appeared only in the postnatal growth plate suggests that a multifunctional design ( Fröhlich et al., 2019 ) may allow pre- and postnatal bones to grow differently. Specifically, we hypothesized that while columns support bone elongation, clusters may support bone expansion. This implies that embryonic bones should expand at a higher rate than postnatal bones, which is consistent with previous studies ( Ahrens et al,2009; Gao et al,2011; Asodi et al,2003; Kuss et al,1997 Li et,2015 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability. 

    Supporting Text:
   . In conclusion, this study utilises the recent wealth of bacterial and mammalian peptide transporter structures to construct a model of their alternating access mechanism. We explain how the movement of two protons through the transporter drives the accompanying conformational changes, as well as how conformational changes and proton-movement events are coupled to the presence of substrate

. Furthermore, we establish several distinct effects of the presence of substrate, coupling ligand binding with protein conformational changes and also linking it to protonation of the E56 and E622 titratable residues. Taken together, our work provides for the first time a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs.

. To investigate the mechanism underpinning peptide–proton coupling, we constructed simulation boxes that included a bound Ala-Phe substrate molecule ( see Materials and methods for details ). We then calculated the Ala-Phe aﬃnity using ABFE simulations in different protein states ( Table 1 ). First, we observed that the aﬃnity is similar in the OF and IF states, indicating that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from OF to IF

. The initial unbiased approach taken in this section, therefore, serves to generate hypotheses for testing by a more rigorous investigation of the protonation state-dependent conformational changes. To this end, we set out to employ enhanced sampling simulations for obtaining conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation state and substrate binding conditions

. Here, we work under the assumption of a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides, motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism. POT family transporters belong to the major facilitator superfamily ( MFS ) and share a conserved topology of two six-helix bundles that form the functional transport domain, their N-and C-termini facing the cytoplasm. ( Newstead et al., 2011 )

. We validate the importance of these residues for transporter function in cell-based transport assays. We also elucidate the role of E53xxER glutamates and the substrate-engaging E622 in controlling the OCC↔IF transition, thereby identifying a clear molecular basis for the directionality of proton movement coupling to conformational changes

., 2012 ). Since R57 interacts with both the ExxER glutamates and the substrate C-terminus, we hypothesise that it may play an important role in substrate–proton coupling. In this study, we use extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD simulations ( totalling close to 1 ms of sampling ) to show how changes in protonation states of H87 and D342 control the OCC↔OF transition as an extracellular gate

Integrating the results from extensive sampling across several MD methods, covering all stages of the PepT2 alternating access cycle, we are now in a position to propose a detailed molecular mechanism of the complete transport cycle, including accounts both of proton coupling to conformational changes and of substrate–proton coupling ( Figure 8 )

. However, we believe that such a fully coupled treatment of proton movement and large-scale conformational changes is not yet computationally feasible, and focussed here on achieving convergence of the conformational sampling in discrete protonation-state combinations. The question of whether proton binding happens in OCC or OF, therefore, warrants further investigation, and indeed the co-existence of several mechanisms may be plausible

. We thus speculate that the proton movement processes may happen as an ensemble of different mechanisms, and potentially occur contemporaneously with the conformational change. This, in addition to a ﬂexible binding pocket, may also contribute to the substrate promiscuity mechanism. We note at this stage that-throughout our study-we have not investigated the possibility of the substrate C-terminus itself becoming ( transiently ) protonated

. Although these unbiased simulations show a large amount of stochasticity and drawing clean conclusions from the data are diﬃcult, we can already appreciate a possible mechanism where protons move down the transporter pore, first engaging H87 and D342 to favour the OF state and then moving to the ExxER motif ( E53 and/or E56 ) and E622 to favour the IF orientation, driving successive conformational changes along the way

. The OCC state thus developed is validated by the further work in this paper, showing it to be a stable conformational basin that is functionally occluded in that it can open both towards OF and IF in different protonation state conditions ( Figures 2—4 ). Equipped with models of the protein conformations required for PepT2 alternating access ( OF, OCC, and IF ), we ran triplicate sets of 1 µs-long MD simulations in a range of conditions

., 2019; Li et al., 2022 ). However, the details of the molecular mechanism of alternating access in POTs, particularly regarding the coupling of conformational changes, substrate binding, and proton movement to each other, remain unclear. Cryo-EM and Alphafold 2 have recently provided views of mammalian POTs in conformations spanning from OF via inward-facing-partially occluded to fully-open IF ( Parker et al., 2021; Killer et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022; Jumper et al

., 1994 ). The latter has a broader expression pattern including the kidneys, lungs, and brain and is described as high-aﬃnity, low-capacity ( Kottra and Daniel, 2004 ). As secondary-active transporters, they couple uphill substrate translocation to the symport of protons down their electrochemical gradient ( Fei et al., 1994; Rubio-Aliaga et al., 2000 ). The peptide–proton stoichiometry is not conserved between different substrates and POT family members ( Parker et al., 2014 )

. Once the substrate ( driven by E622 protonation ) and the protons ( driven by their electrochemical potential gradient ) have left through the open intracellular gate into the intracellular bulk, the resulting apo, standard-protonation-state IF conformation has a thermodynamic preference to return to OCC as evidenced in our 2D-PMFs. We thus arrive back at the starting state and have completed the proton-and substrate-coupled alternating access cycle

. We can also speculate that-in addition to this thermodynamic favouring of E56 protonation-there might be a kinetic effect on proton transfer from moving the positively charged R57 out of the way of the incoming proton. This could be investigated using reactive MD or QM/MM simulations ( both approaches have been employed for other protonation steps of procaryotic peptide transporters, see Parker et al., 2017 and Li et al., 2022 ), however the putative path is very long ( ≈1

. Likewise, a coupled enhanced-sampling treatment involving both proton movement and large-scale conformational changes-as discussed above for the ordering of steps in the OCC → OF transition-would make for interesting future work, once it becomes computationally tractable

. We found that the extracellular gate remains stably closed in triplicates of 1 μs-long MD when H87 or D342 are protonated individually, but the OCC state can open spontaneously on the simulated time scale to an OF conformation when both are protonated simultaneously ( Figure 2b; Figure 2—figure supplement 1a for plots of the opposite gate in the same trajectories, showing how ﬂexibility of the intra-and extracellular gates is anti-correlated )

Researchers investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during speech production in humans using intracran electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants. They characterized the topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus (ST), and performed a delayed feedback (DF) task to determine whether suppressed sites were sensitive to auditory alterations. Results showed overlapping sites exhibited enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. A strong correlation was found between the degree of auditory suppression and sensitivity, suggesting suppression might underlie speech monitoring. When participants produced speech with simultaneous feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated during the DF paradigm, indicating attentional load modulated auditory sensitivity.

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to feedback in neurophysiological recordings. Results revealed sites in the ST exhibited both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback with a strong correlation, supporting the hypothesis that suppression predicts sensitivity to errors in humans. Delaying feedback during production enhanced auditory responses in ST, and the degree of sensitivity varied across recording sites. A correlation was found between suppression and sensitivity, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between suppression and monitoring.

The study used neurourgical recordings to identify sites showing suppression during speech and employed a DF paradigm to test sensitivity to perturbed feedback. Auditory responses are largely suppressed during production, but detailed recordings revealed variable suppression across sites and non-suppressed responses. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated feedback-induced adjustments accompanied enhanced responses in various regions. The hypothesis was that suppression linked to sensitivity to errors, as predicted by models and data in non-human primates. A task was used to disrupt speech fluency by delaying feedback, and sites showing suppression elicited enhanced responses to perturbations. The role of attention in sensitivity was investigated by comparing responses during perturbation and normal production.

Supporting production, studies reported suppressed responses in cortex during speaking compared to listening, and enhanced when feedback was perturbed indicating sensitivity. The study identified a neural population in ST sensitive to altered feedback or highly sensitive to temporal perturbations. A correlation was found between suppression and sensitivity, suggesting a shared mechanism underlying speech monitoring.

    Title: 
    Abstract: A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over. 

    Supporting Text:
   . All CoCoNuTs contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, or YTH domains, along with RNases, such as HEPN, suggesting that at least one of the activities of these systems targets RNA

. We then zeroed in on a single major but previously overlooked branch of the McrBC systems, which we denoted CoCoNuTs for their salient features, namely, the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. Astounding complexity was discovered at this level as well, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs that differ by their domain compositions and genomic associations

. RNA targeting capability of Types III-B and III-C can perhaps be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Moreover, higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas ( see below ). We suspect that RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of the CoCoNuT systems

., 2013 ), which could also be true for the CoCoNuT Cnu ( C ) Ds. Consistent with this prediction, Type II and III-A CoCoNuTs likely target RNA rather than DNA, given that the respective operons encode HEPN RNases, typically the only recognizable nuclease in these systems

. The conserved association of the CDC48-like ATPases with these Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which encode the potentially tmRNA-binding SPB domain, seems to provide support for the scenario of tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of the bacteriocin-like protein encoded in these loci indicates that it adopts an inactivated PD- ( D/E ) xK-type restriction endonuclease fold, potentially nucleic acid-binding ( Supplementary file 1 )

. Here we present the results of this census and describe an extraordinary, not previously appreciated variety of domain architectures of the McrBC family of Type IV restriction systems. In particular, we focus on a major McrBC branch that we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandem ( CoCoNuT ) systems, which we explore in detail.

. Hsp70-like ATPase NBD/SBD domains and HEAT-like repeats are fused to the CnuC/McrC N-terminal DUF2357 domain in Type III-A CoCoNuT, but their homologs in Types III-B and III-C are encoded by a separate gene. We denote these proteins CnuD and CnuCD, the latter for the CnuC-CnuD fusions in Type III-A

., 2018 ). These HIRAN domains, however, do not overlay with the CoCoNuT domains any better than SmpB ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ), lack a small helix that SmpB and the CoCoNuT domains share, and likely being DNA-binding, do not fit the other pieces of evidence we gathered that all suggest an RNA-binding role for this domain in the CoCoNuTs ( see below )

., 2016; Bobrovskyy et al., 2022 ). The CoCoNuT-associated homologs also possess three ATPase domains but differ in that only the central D2 domain homolog is predicted to be active. They are also distinguished from EssC by the presence of a coiled-coil that can exceed 200 residues in length and is fused at their N-terminus, whereas forkhead-associated domains and transmembrane helices are found in this position in EssC ( Supplementary file 1; Bobrovskyy et al., 2022; Warne et al

. Most of the CoCoNuTs are potentially endowed with DNA-targeting activity as well, either by factors integral to the system, such as the McrC-like nuclease, or more loosely associated, such as Type I RM and Druantia Type III systems that are encoded in the same predicted superoperons with many CoCoNuTs. Numerous CoCoNuTs are associated with proteins containing CARF domains, suggesting that cyclic ( oligo ) nucleotides regulate the CoCoNuT activity

. In Type III-A CoCoNuT, the nuclease domain was lost entirely and replaced by the Hsp70-like NBD/SBD domain with RNA-binding potential described above ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 4, Supplementary file 1 ). Often, one or two CSDs, generally RNA-binding domains, although capable of binding ssDNA, are fused to Type III-A CnuC homologs as well ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 4, Supplementary file 1; Heinemann and Roske, 2021 )

. All CnuC/McrC homologs in Type II or III CoCoNuT systems lack the PD- ( D/E ) xK catalytic motif that is required for nuclease activity, although for Type II and Types III-B and III-C, but not Type III-A, structural modeling indicates that the inactivated nuclease domain was retained, likely for a nucleic acid-binding role ( Figure 6, Supplementary file 1 )

. In contrast, in the CARF-containing CoCoNuTs, both the DNA and RNA restriction factors appear to be arranged such that binding of a 2′, 3′ cyclic phosphate RNA fragment by the CARF domain would initiate the expression of the entire gene cluster ( McMahon et al., 2020 ). In the case of the CoCoNuTs, signals of infection could promote transcription, first of the DNA restriction systems, and then, the CoCoNuT itself, a predicted RNA restriction system

. We classified the CoCoNuTs into three types and seven subtypes based on the GTPase domain phylogeny and conserved genomic context ( Figure 3 ). Type I-A and Type I-C systems consist of McrB and McrC homologs only, which we denote CnuB and CnuC ( Figure 3 and Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 5—figure supplement 4 )

., 2022 ). These can potentially interact with coiled-coils in the CoCoNuTs, perhaps, guiding them to the DNA from which RNA targeted by the CoCoNuTs is being transcribed, or vice versa ( Figure 8 )

. Thus, a novel type of conditional or otherwise complex translation regulation likely occurs in these species, perhaps triggered by phage infection ( for the accessions of identifiable Type III-A CoCoNuT factors in Helicobacter, see Supplementary file 3 ). Genomic neighborhoods of many Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs encompass complex operonic associations with genes encoding several types of CARF domain-containing proteins ( Figures 7 and 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1 )

. Therefore, it appears likely that the CoCoNuT CnuD homologs bind ATP/ADP but hydrolyze ATP with extremely low efficiency, at best. Such properties in an Hsp70-like domain are better compatible with RNA binding than unfolded protein binding or remodeling, suggesting that these CnuD homologs may target the respective systems to viral/aberrant RNA. Many Hsp70 homologs have been reported to associate with ribosomes ( Mayer, 2021; Willmund et al

., 2019 ), which is consistent with the idea that the CoNu homologs interact with translation components, such as the Smp-like OB-fold or YTH domains, and RNases, such as HN ( Figure 6, Figure— supplements 1 and 4, Supplementary 1 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

   . In this study, we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, we found that the knockdown of tax-6 enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. We discovered that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP )

., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ). However, the role of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans response to pathogen infections has not been studied. Because C. elegans lacks the NFAT transcription factors ( Song et al., 2013 ), it will be intriguing to study how calcineurin inhibition impacts C. elegans innate immunity. These studies could also shed some light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity

., 2015; Hogan et al., 2003; Vandewalle et al., 2014 ). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, calcineurin regulates thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2013 ). Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators ( CRTCs; Dong et al

We discovered that calcineurin is required for the C. elegans DMP. Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels. Increased amounts of calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin to calcineurin ( Klee et al., 1998 ). The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves ( Dal Santo et al., 1999; Teramoto and Iwasaki, 2006 )

., 2010; Guerrero et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood. Calcineurin, a conserved protein from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways ( Chen et al., 2022; Hogan et al., 2003; Schulz and Yutzey, 2004; Ulengin-Talkish and Cyert, 2023 )

., 2005 ). It is interesting to note that tax-6 gain-of-function mutants are also known to have DMP defects ( Lee et al., 2005 ). Therefore, optimum calcineurin activity appears to be crucial for maintaining a rhythmic DMP. Calcineurin inhibition has been shown to extend C. elegans lifespan via multiple mechanisms ( Dong et al., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 )

. Conversely, knockdown of flr-1, nhx-2, and pbo-1 in N2 animals resulted in significantly reduced survival on P. aeruginosa compared to control RNAi ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3G ). Knockdown of these genes causes complete disruption of DMP rhythmicity, increasing gut colonization by P. aeruginosa ( Singh and Aballay, 2019b ). Overall, these findings demonstrated that calcineurin is crucial for maintaining the DMP ultradian clock, and its inhibition increases susceptibility to P

. Several C. elegans mutants with defects in the DMP and bloated intestinal lumens are known to have dampened nutrient absorption, leading to reduced lipid deposition in the gut, mimicking calorie restriction ( Sheng et al., 2015 ). It is possible that some of the effects of intestinal bloating on the host physiology are mediated by calorie restriction

., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ), we confirmed that both tax-6 loss of function and RNAi knockdown led to an increased lifespan on E. coli ( Figure 1E and F ). An earlier study demonstrated that calcineurin regulates cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) and CRTCs to regulate lifespan in C. elegans ( Mair et al., 2011 ). The knockdown of the CREB homolog-1 ( crh-1 ) and crtc-1 enhanced lifespan similar to the tax-6 knockdown ( Mair et al., 2011 )

. Thus, calcineurin inhibition likely enhances lifespan via NHR-8 by increasing its expression. Given that HLH-30 and NHR-8 are essential for lifespan extension upon calcineurin inhibition, we investigated whether these pathways also influence survival in response to P. aeruginosa infection following calcineurin knockdown. Both hlh-30 ( tm1978 ) and nhr-8 ( ok186 ) animals showed significantly reduced survival upon tax-6 RNAi ( Figure 6A and B )

., 2014; Verma et al., 2018 ). It remains to be studied whether NHR-8 and HLH-30 work in the same or different pathways downstream of calcineurin inhibition ( Figure 6C ). Recent studies in different organisms have shown that gut bloating has profound effects on food-seeking behaviors, immunity, and lifespan ( Duvall et al., 2019; Filipowicz et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2019; Min et al., 2021; Singh and Aballay, 2019b; Singh and Aballay, 2019c ). Several C

. The knockdown of tax-6 resulted in intestinal bloating due to defects in the DMP, which enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria. Intestinal bloating resulted in calorie restriction-like phenotypes, including reduced lipid levels, and led to increased lifespan. We discovered that the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan extension

. To further confirm that calcineurin inhibition enhances lifespan via calorie restriction, we examined the lifespan of eat-2 ( ad465 ) ;tax-6 ( ok2065 ) double mutants. While eat-2 ( ad465 ) animals displayed increased lifespan compared to N2 controls, eat-2 ( ad465 ) ;tax-6 ( ok2065 ) double mutants had a lifespan similar to tax-6 ( ok2065 ) animals ( Figure 4E ). These results suggested that calcineurin inhibition promotes lifespan extension through calorie restriction mechanisms

., 2007 ), we explored whether calcineurin inhibition could similarly increase lifespan through calorie restriction mechanisms. The knockdown of tax-6 in the genetic model of calorie restriction, eat-2 ( ad465 ) ( Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998 ), did not increase the lifespan ( Figure 4D ). Since eat-2 ( ad465 ) animals consume fewer bacteria, it is possible that their feeding-based RNAi efficiency is reduced, leading to a lack of responsiveness to tax-6 RNAi

To understand the role of calcineurin in the innate immune response of C. elegans, we examined the survival of a hypomorphic allele of tax-6, tax-6 ( p675 ), when exposed to the pathogenic bacterium P. aeruginosa PA14. Surprisingly, tax-6 ( p675 ) mutants showed significantly reduced survival on P. aeruginosa compared to wild-type N2 animals ( Figure 1A ). Similarly, animals carrying a null allele of tax-6, tax-6 ( ok2065 ), also exhibited a significant decrease in survival on P

. Moreover, we found that the nuclear receptor NHR-8 is upregulated by calcinein inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcine in the C. elegans DMP and provide a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents and resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information in goal-directed behavior. They proposed that conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive processes working along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts from similar sources are represented similarly in the space. A task was designed with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that different types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of cognitive space representation in conflict. It hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in a space, with distance between points reflecting the geometry of the space and difference in sources of conflicts. Dimensions in the space can be domains where domain-specific control processes are defined. A type of conflict can be parameterized using a number of coordinates reflecting control needed for each domain-specific control. The space can represent types of conflicts with low dimensionality. Different domains can be represented conjunct in a space to achieve domain-general control from different sources can be resolved using same processes.

The space may be located in the frontopetal network due to its roles in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving conflicts are proposed: domain-general control and domain-specific. Domain control posits the frontopetal encodes information and flexibly implements strategies for types. This is supported by generalizable adjustment. However, how to construct states with continuous levels of similarity is a challenge. Recent work showed it possible to manipulate continuous similarity using two types with varying ratios, which can examine behavioral and neural evidence for the space.

Consistent with literature, an effect was observed in the pre-sup motor area. The encoding of type as space was tested by identifying regions with activation parametrically covarying with coordinates in the hypothesized space. Regions encoding type as space were tested by whether RSM can be explained by similarity between types. If conflicts are organized in space, similarity in behavior and neural should be reflected. Data from two experiments supported predictions: behavioral found congruence influence in control. Recent studies have conceptualized control within a space. For example, mapped conditions to locations in space to demonstrate domain-general/domain problems.

This study manipulated types parametrically, highlighting a challenge in science: manipulating similarity for conflicts and high-level processes are abstract. Even within brain areas, found activity can factor into dimensions encoding domain-general and domain information selectively. A domain view holds frontopetal regions involved multiple demands beyond conflict. This suggests control may be in an abstract space, reconciling debate between domain-general and domain views and providing a framework understanding brains flexibly represents multiple settings.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [sPTL] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM] ) membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response. Thus, we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to herein as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, sPTL, or PPROM. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations. Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. Yet, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes. This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C.

    This study represents the largest ( N = 739 women, n = 2819 samples ) and most comprehensive ( 31 immune mediators ) profiling of the soluble immune response in vaginal fluid throughout well-characterized pregnancies that culminated in the delivery of a term neonate ( controls ) or those that resulted in sPTB ( sPTL and PPROM cases ) ( Figure 1A ). Specifically, we enrolled pregnant women from whom vaginal swabs were collected at different points throughout gestation

. Regardless, these data show that the vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for a subset of early sPTB, highlighting that vaginal immune mediator changes in a subset of preterm birth are attributable to factors other than maternal characteristics.

. To interrogate whether alterations in the vaginal immunoproteome are observed in women destined to undergo sPTB, immune mediator data were quantified in vaginal swabs collected longitudinally from early to late gestation ( in the interval of 8–37 weeks ) from women who ultimately delivered term or preterm

. First, by profiling 31 immune mediators, including two antimicrobial molecules, we established the gestational age-dependent changes in the vaginal immunoproteome during normal gestation.

Herein, we conducted the largest assessment, based on the study’s scale, longitudinal nature, and depth of immunological mediators evaluated, of the vaginal immunoproteome during uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies. Importantly, our determinations were performed in vaginal samples collected during all three trimesters and considered sPTB, including its two subsets ( i. e., sPTL and PPROM ), as well as the timing of delivery ( i. e., early and late sPTB )

. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the vaginal immunoproteome analyzed during the second trimester can generate noninvasive biomarkers with potential predictive value for early preterm birth cases, although the clinical utility of such models needs to be investigated further

. These results show that a specific subset of preterm births, early PPROM, is associated with reduced concentrations of antimicrobial proteins, indicating that a dampened or impaired antimicrobial response may be associated with its pathophysiology. Besides cytokines, chemokines, and defensins, we also determined the vaginal concentrations of growth factors that are associated with immunobiological functions; namely, GM-CSF ( Hamilton, 2008; Becher et al

. These data further highlight the shared but subtly different mechanisms of disease underlying sPTL and PPROM. Up to this point, our data show that specific components of the vaginal immunoproteome are disrupted in women who ultimately undergo sPTB and that such disruption is distinct among different subsets of preterm birth

. Vaginal immune mediators that were shown to be distinct among birth outcome groups in models controlling for gestational age were analyzed again to determine whether the trends of change across gestation varied among the different birth outcomes

. These data indicate that the vaginal immunoproteome undergoes specific changes during normal pregnancy, which involve a decline in pro-inflammatory mediators, an increase in T cell-associated chemokines, and the tight regulation of growth factors and defensins

. To show that the vaginal immunoproteome is capturing variations distinct from maternal characteristics, we compared our models, including the vaginal immunoproteome, to models generated from maternal characteristics alone. Immune mediator data and maternal characteristics resulted in significantly improved prediction of PPROM <34 ( DeLong test p<0. 023 ) and led to higher point estimates for all other outcomes when using the last sample before 28 weeks ( Figure 7 )

. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we next evaluated whether the vaginal immunoproteome could serve to generate noninvasive biomarkers for preterm birth subsets with improved predictive value over maternal clinical and demographic information. Random forest modeling of the vaginal immunoproteome was used to establish a predictive tool for sPTB and its subtypes

., 2016; Gomez-Lopez et al., 2021 ), our study further incriminates such an innate immune response in the pathophysiology of a subset of preterm births. Important components of mucosal immunity in the vagina are T cells ( Benjelloun et al., 2020 ) and T-cell-associated mediators, such as IL-2 ( Short et al., 2018; Gandhi et al., 2020; Florova et al., 2021 ), IL-4 ( Short et al., 2018; Florova et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ), IL-17A ( Florova et al

. 637 ) ( Figure 7C ) compared to early PPROM. For early sPTL, concentrations of IL-1β, IL-16, and IL-13 were most informative. When maternal characteristics ( maternal age, BMI, parity, and history of preterm birth ) were included in the models with all vaginal analytes ( red line ), the prediction accuracy of models predicting sPTB, and the subsets of all sPTL cases and all PPROM cases, was improved ( p<0. 05 for all ) ( Figure 7A, B, and D )

. Recent models, however, have leveraged vaginal host–microbe interactions by incorporating the determination of immune mediators, which improved the prediction of sPTB ( Elovitz et al., 2019; Fettweis et al., 2019; Pruski et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, an extensive interrogation of the vaginal soluble immune response ( i. e., the vaginal immunoproteome ), with consideration of the distinction between sPTL and PPROM cases, has not been undertaken

. When considering the vaginal concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and defensins without including maternal characteristics ( black line ), the vaginal immunoproteome has the highest potential predictive value for early PPROM <34 ( area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 787 ) ( Figure 7E ), with the two most informative immune mediators for the prediction of early PPROM being VEGF and IL-1β

. Together, these findings suggest that the vaginal cytokine network in normal pregnancy is modestly modulated during gestation, which prompted us to investigate whether a deviation from these changes occurs in women who ultimately undergo sPTB

. Notably, the lack of adjustment for maternal characteristics confirmed the significance of the immune mediators found in the adjusted model as well as four additional immune mediators, suggesting that adjustment for maternal characteristics provides a more stringent model. In addition, a correlation analysis was also performed between the changes in concentrations of vaginal analytes in sPTL vs. controls and PPROM vs. controls ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Here, we describe an in silico model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. Although experimental data suggest that KV1. 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In female cells, which have larger KV2. 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes, predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2. 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. In summary, we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.

    Our primary objective was to develop and implement a novel computational model that comprehensively describes the essential mechanisms underlying electrical activity and Ca2+ dynamics in arterial myocytes. We aimed to uncover the key components necessary and sufficient to fully understand the behavior of arterial vascular smooth muscle myocytes and the cellular response to variations in pressure. The model represents the first-ever integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV2

. The Hernandez–Hernandez model predicts that KV2. 1 channels play a critical, unexpectedly large role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes compared to male myocytes. Importantly, our model predicts that clinically used antihypertensive CaV1. 2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in CaV1. 2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes

. Finally, we present a one-dimensional ( 1D ) vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series. Predictions from the idealized vessel suggest that Ca2+ channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial [Ca2+]i reduction in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez–Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in CaV1. 2 and KV2

. Here, we describe a new model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates new electrophysiological and Ca2+ signaling data suggesting key sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global [Ca2+]i signaling in male and female myocytes. The Hernandez–Hernandez model predicts that KV2

. To conclude, we developed and present the Hernandez–Hernandez model of male and female isolated mesenteric vascular myocytes. An additional limitation of our study is the reliance on predominantly murine data. Although mouse arteries do present numerous parallels with human arteries, including analogous intravascular pressure-myogenic tone relationships, resting membrane potentials, and the expression of typical ionic channels like CaV1. 2, BKCa channels, and RyRs ( Yang et al

. The total voltage-gated K+ current ( IKvTOT ) is the sum of IKV1. 5 and IKv2. 1 mathematically described as ( 4 ) IKvTOT=IKv2. 1+IKv1. 5 Notably, the main specific sex-specific differences observed in the total voltage-gated K+ current ( IKvTOT ) is attributable to the sex-specific differences in the current produced by KV2. 1 channels. We next analyzed the contribution of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium ( BKCa ) channels to vascular smooth muscle cell electrophysiology

. Having developed an idealized model of a vessel, we set out to validate the model predictions of variable [Ca2+]i between males and females by comparing the computed calcium signaling in vascular smooth muscle with experimental recordings ( O’Dwyer et al., 2020 ). Given that membrane potential predominantly governs calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle ( Knot and Nelson, 1998a ), we varied the conductance of the nonselective cation currents ( INSCC ) in our simulations

. Paradoxically, by promoting the structural clustering of the CaV1. 2 channel, KV2. 1 enhances Ca2+ influx and induces vasoconstriction. Interestingly, KV2. 1 protein is expressed to a larger extent in female than in male arterial smooth muscle. This induced larger CaV1. 2 clusters and activity in female than in male arterial myocytes

. 2, BKCa channels, and RyRs ( Yang et al., 2013; Nystoriak et al., 2017; Nieves-Cintrón et al., 2017 ). Future research should assess the direct applicability and implication of our findings in human subjects. The Hernandez–Hernandez model of the isolated mesenteric vascular myocyte was informed and validated with experimental data from male and female vascular myocytes. We then used the model to reveal sex-specific mechanisms of KV2. 1 and CaV1

. 2 channel activity, [Ca2+]i, and contraction of arterial smooth muscle ( Amberg and Santana, 2006; Zhong et al., 2010; Archer et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2002; Amberg et al., 2004 ). A recent study by O’Dwyer et al., 2020 suggested that KV2. 1 channels have dual conducting and structural roles in mesenteric artery smooth muscle with opposing functional consequences. Conductive KV2. 1 channels oppose vasoconstriction by inducing membrane hyperpolarization

. 2 channels produced a current of 0. 5 pA. However, in female simulations ( Figure 7D ), we observed that at a steady membrane potential of –40 mV, L-type calcium CaV1. 2 channels produced a current of 0. 65 pA. We calculated that at –40 mV, two CaV1. 2 channels are needed to sustain 0. 5 pA of current in male myocytes while three CaV1. 2 channels are needed to sustain 0. 65 pA of current in female myocytes

In this study, we developed a computational model of the electrical activity of an isolated vascular smooth muscle cell ( Figure 1 ). A key goal was to optimize and validate the model with experimental data and then use the model to predict the effects of measured sex-dependent differences in the electrophysiology of smooth muscle myocytes. In constructing the model, we first set out to measure the kinetics of the voltage-gated L-type CaV1

. 2 channels supply the steady Ca2+ influx needed to support a maintained constricted state in small arteries and arterioles ( Fleischmann et al., 1994; Rubart et al., 1996 ). The differences between males and females are notable in the context of observations indicating varied sex-based responses to antihypertensive agents that target the Ca2+ handling system in vascular smooth muscle cells

. 1 and CaV1. 2 channels, enabling the prediction of sex-specific disparities in membrane potential and the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells from systemic arteries. To further investigate sex-specific responses to antihypertensive medications, we extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional ( 1D ) representation of tissue

. Indeed, when we adjusted the conductance of the nonselective cation currents and implemented an increase in the conductance of INSC in the female model, we readily reproduced the sex-specific baseline membrane potential observed experimentally ( Figure 5A ). Next, using the whole-cell vascular smooth muscle myocyte computational model, we investigated the sex-specific differences in the contribution to total voltage-gated current ( IKVTOT ) in mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells

. Importantly, these predictions also suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of nifedipine cause larger overall reductions in Ca2+ influx in female than in male arterial myocytes. Thus far, we have shown the development and application of models of vascular smooth muscle myocytes incorporating measured sex-specific differences in currents from male and female isolated cells

. An interesting prediction from the in silico simulations is that at different depolarizing states ( −45, –40, and –35 mV ) induced by changing the conductance of nonselective cationic leak currents ( INSC ), the contribution of IKv2. 1 and IKv1. 5 to IKvTOT is different based on sex. In male vascular myocytes, the contribution to total voltage-gated current ( IKVTOT ) is largely attributable to the current produced by KV.5 channels. In contrast, in female myocytes, the contribution to IKVT is largely due to the current produced by KV.1 channels

The Hernandez–Hern model predicts that KV.1 channels play a critical role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes compared to male myocytes. The model also predicts that clinically used antihypensive Ca1.2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in Ca1.2 currents in female than in arterial myocytes. The Hernandez–Hern model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in Ca1.2 and KV.
Researchers investigated how climate interacts with decomposers of different sizes to influence litter decomposition along a sharp precipitation gradient. They placed litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites with varying precipitation and characterized macrocomposer assemblages using pit trapping. Decompos responded differently to precipitation based on size, with microbial decomposition increasing in winter and macrocomposition in arid during summer. This led to similar decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyperid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. The study highlights the importance of macrocomposition in aridlands and resolves the dry decomposition conund, emphasizing the need to consider decomposer size when investigating biogeochemical processes.

 Macrocomposition contributed minimally to whole-community decomposition in winter but dominated in arid sites during summer. Pit trapping found macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a h-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in ar environments. The goal was to investigate how climate interacts with biota of different categories to influence litter. Results suggest decompos respond to precipitation based on size, leading to similar rates across gradient except hyperid. Predicted opposing dependencies macrofa and microorganisms mesa lead to similar rates except hyperid sites. To reveal mechanism, sampled macrocompos across aridity and seasons using pit traps. Macrocomposition followed h-shaped response precipitation, peaking ar ecosystems.

The study supported long-suggested hypothesis that macrocomposition governs litter in deserts. Opposing dependencies micro and macro led to similar or higher rates arid compared to mesic. Predicted negative between moisture and macro in dry may be reversed hyperid. Extreme conditions and scarce litter limit macro populations, diminishing rates with aridity. The study found macrocomposition reflect variation in abundance, richness, and biomass across precipitation. Richness, abundance, and biomass followed h-shaped with precipitation, peaking ar and diminishing hyperid or semiar. The differential dependencies explain discrepancy between classic models and observed rates dry.

The puzzle why decomposition arid is decoupled from precipitation and faster than microbial models has bothered scientists. The study hypothesized opposing dependencies macro and micro lead similar rates except hyperid. Whole decomposition was minimal hyperid in both summer and winter. The association between macrocomposition and abundance, richness, and biomass support hypothesis. Theory suggests litter by mes-depos increase moisture, supported by crossi experiment. Predicted h-shaped between precipitation and macro abundance, richness, biomass peak ar ecosystems. The gradient represents hyperid, arid, semiar, and subhum Mediterranean. Repeated during summer and winter. Hypothesized microbial and mesa increase precipitation winter, but dry contribute minimally across ar. Parallels between spatial and temporal ar, winter communities arid similar summer moreic. Arid showed seasonal dynamics.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

   . org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology ). Deletion of Cyrib in the pancreas, in concert with expression of KRAS G12D and p53 R172H, led to acceleration of PanIN formation and an increase in the area of pancreas showing lesions with high phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK, two crucial downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion

., 2018; Le et al., 2021 ), but did not address the potential role that CYRI-B could play in tumourigenesis and metastasis, given its central role as a regulator of motility. We noticed that CYRI-B was highly expressed in human pancreatic cancers and correlated with poorer survival ( Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020 ). Increased expression of CYRI-B in mice with PDAC suggested that this model could help to reveal the role of CYRI-B in human PDAC

. Thus, loss of Cyrib in the KPC model accelerates PanIN formation and progression, likely due to loss of CYRI-B’s capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS leading to abnormal architecture, combined with hyperactivation of ERK and JNK to drive proliferation. The KPC mouse model is characterised by high metastatic rates to clinically relevant organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel ( Hingorani et al., 2005 )

. Thus, CYRI-B localises on macropinosomes in pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting a possible mechanism for how CYRI-B loss could affect tumour progression. One of the first proteins to be recruited to macropinosomes, once they internalise, is Rab5, which is present on vesicles that move from the periphery of the cells towards the perinuclear region ( Bucci et al., 1994; Buckley and King, 2017; de Hoop et al., 1994 )

. To further investigate a potential role for Cyrib in pancreatic cancer, we first assessed the expression of CYRI-B in the KPC mouse model of metastatic PDAC ( Hingorani et al., 2005 ). In this model, PanIN develops by around 10 weeks and progresses to later stages towards 15 weeks, with full-blown PDAC appearing at this stage and mice reaching end-point with a half time of median 150–200 days

. Here, we demonstrate that CYRI-B is highly expressed in PDAC and can contribute to PDAC development, progression, and metastasis. We discover a role for CYRI-B in signalling that drives proliferation in early lesions. Later, during metastasis, we find that CYRI-B is required for chemotaxis towards LPA, implicating macropinocytic uptake of LPAR1 in PDAC metastasis

. Pancreatic samples from KPC or CKPC mice revealed no differences at 10 weeks, but more PanIN2 and -3 lesions were present in 15-week-old CKPC mice over KPC controls ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), indicating an acceleration of early progression. To further probe the role of Cyrib in lesion formation, we sought to understand the potential downstream signalling pathways that might be involved

. Tumours are frequently starved for amino acids and other nutrients and macropinocytosis is a major way for PDAC tumours to take up proteins, lipids, and cell debris from their environment ( Commisso et al., 2013; Hobbs and Der, 2022; Kamphorst et al., 2015; Puccini et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2019 ). Macropinocytosis also provides cells with a mechanism for internalisation of signalling receptors ( Clayton and Cousin, 2009; Le et al., 2021; Stow et al

. RAC1 is an important cancer driver downstream of KRAS and its ablation in mouse models delayed the onset of precancerous lesions ( Heid et al., 2011 ) and led to an inability to sustain precancer progression to PDAC ( Wu et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we asked whether loss of the RAC1 interactor Cyrib affected the onset and progression between stages of PanIN1–3 ( Figure 3A and B )

. While we were not able to measure RAC1 activity in tumours directly, it would be desirable to do this in the future, using such tools as a RAC1 FRET biosensor mouse model ( Floerchinger et al., 2021 ). It would also be interesting to determine whether CYRI-A is involved in pancreatic cancer progression, as we previously implicated this protein in RAC1 binding ( Yelland et al., 2021 ) and macropinocytosis ( Le et al., 2021 )

. Live-cell imaging of AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells transfected with CYRI-B-p17-GFP and mScarlet-Lck, a marker of the plasma membrane, showed that CYRI-B and Lck co-localised at the finger-like protrusions, cups, and internalised vesicles, confirming the localisation of CYRI-B on macropinosomes ( Figure 7B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and Figure 6—video 2 )

. After ~50 s of internalisation, Rab5 is recruited to the macropinosomes ( Figure 7B and Figure 7—video 2 ), suggesting that CYRI-B is present prior to and also during early macropinosome formation as marked with Rab5. An important but often overlooked role of macropinocytosis is the maintenance of cell surface receptors ( Buckley and King, 2017 )

We have revealed an important role of CYRI-B in PDAC development, progression, and metastasis using the KPC mouse model and cells derived from the tumours. Our previous cell biology studies highlighted a role for CYRI-B as a buffer of RAC1-mediated actin assembly in lamellipodia and macropinocytic cups ( Fort et al., 2018; Le et al

., 2005 ). Since CYRI-B regulates cell migration and chemotaxis ( Fort et al., 2018 ), we asked whether deletion of CYRI-B can affect the metastatic potential of cancer cells in the CKPC mouse model. Analysis of mice at end-point from KPC and CKPC cohorts revealed similar infrequent metastasis to the diaphragm in both cohorts, but a significant reduction in metastasis to both the liver and bowel of CKPC mice ( Figure 4A and B )

. We might predict, based on amplified expression of CYRI-B, that RAC1 activity might be dampened down at least during some stages of tumourigenesis. Having a buffer for RAC1 activity could provide advantages for tumours, where mutations in KRAS will drive high activation of RAC1, which might be detrimental to cell survival due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production and enhanced downstream signalling

., 2019 ). In particular, we previously showed that LPAR1 is important for chemotaxis of pancreatic cancer cells ( Juin et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we hypothesised that CYRI-B might influence the internalisation of LPAR1 at the leading edge. 70 kDa TRITC dextran was added to the medium and cells were imaged using live time lapse microscopy to visualise the macropinosomes in COS-7 cells transfected with LPAR-1 GFP

. RAC1 can drive cell proliferation through activation of both JNK and ERK downstream signalling pathways ( Bagrodia et al., 1995; Coso et al., 1995; Rul et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we probed histological sections of pancreatic tissues from 15-week-old KPC and CKPC mice for pJNK and pERK. Consistent with enhanced RAC1 signalling, we observed increased pJNK and pER in CKPC tumours compared to KPC ( Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: HERV-K ( HML-2 ), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

    We have characterized a clade of HERV-K HML-2-related ERVs in rhesus macaques and other OWMs that include an ~750 bp non-coding region in between env and the 3′ LTR, derived from a recombination with a HERVK11 HML-8 retrovirus

. Both of these characteristics indicate that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion ( less than about 500, 000 years old ), and suggests that rhesus macaques could possibly harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses

. In summary, we have characterized a clade of ERVs in rhesus macaques that may serve as a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time, and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis

., 2019; Macfarlane and Badge, 2015 ). A 2007 study identified 19 HML-2 proviruses in rhesus macaques ( designated as ‘RhERV-K’ ), including three with almost identical long terminal repeats ( LTRs ), implying relatively recent integration ( Romano et al., 2007 ). More recently, another study identified several HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, detected expression of env mRNA, and identified one macaque with an Env-specific immune response ( Wu et al., 2016 )

. In order to investigate the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques, we searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed an in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a particular focus on SERV-K1-like proviruses. We have found that SERV-K1 is part of a large clade of rhesus proviruses that show signs of recent activity

. Taken together, this evidence suggests infectious activity of HERV-K-like retroviruses in rhesus macaques within the last 500–250, 000 years, and the potential for ongoing replication

. For genomes that we identified SERV-K1-like proviruses we used TableBrowser and RepeatMasker as a complementary approach to retrieve HML-2 sequences, as we did with rhesus macaques. To determine the presence or absence of orthologous SERV-K/MER11 insertions in primates with SERV-K1-like proviruses, we used BLAT searches with proviral flanking sequences as queries

. Thus, a comprehensive characterization of HML-2 proviruses in the rhesus macaque reference genome would provide a valuable starting point for further investigations of this potential

. In contrast to SERV-K/MER11 proviruses, the non-recombinant proviruses are much older on average; the youngest non-recombinant provirus in rhesus macaques is estimated to have integrated ~10 million years ago, although orthologous insertions are present in colobine monkeys as well, suggesting that this age may be an underestimate

. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of interspecies transmission of a virus in the HERV-K HML-2 clade, and raises a number of interesting questions, most notably, whether macaques or other OWM species still contain actively replicating SERV-K/MER11 viruses, and whether those viruses are also capable of interspecies transmission

., 2013; Wang-Johanning et al., 2014; Lee and Bieniasz, 2007 ). The oldest known human HML-2 proviruses have orthologous insertions in both apes and Old World monkeys ( OWM ), indicating that the clade originated in the common ancestor of the catarrhine primates ( Bannert and Kurth, 2006 ). However, much less is known about the evolutionary history and extent of HML-2 activity in non-human primates than in humans

. Similar HML-2-mediated genomic rearrangements have been observed in the human genome, however no reciprocal pairs of recombinants were identified in humans ( Hughes and Coffin, 2001 ). More detailed understanding of the timing and location of this transmission event may be provided by screening the genomes of other Asian primate species for SERV-K/MER11 proviruses. It is also worth considering whether interspecies transmission has any implications for the biology of these viruses

. For each SERV-K/MER11 proviral insertion, we identified in rhesus macaques we retrieved the full proviral sequence from the UCSC Genome Browser, plus 1000 bp of flanking sequence upstream and downstream, and used that sequence as a BLAT query in each genome. A proviral insertion was counted as present in a species if at least one provirus-flanking sequence junction was intact in the genome assembly for that species

. There are thus a total of 106 SERV-K1-like proviruses ( including SERV-K1 itself ) that are included in the following analyses. To better understand the evolutionary history of HML-2 in macaques, we generated maximum likelihood trees using pol, env, and LTR sequences for all the proviruses identified. As previously mentioned, a large number of proviruses had deletions in pol, env, or both, and thus are not included in those trees

., 2014; Springer et al., 2012 ). As younger proviral insertions are likely to be insertionally polymorphic, we screened 23 of the rhesus SERV-K/MER11 proviruses for insertional polymorphism in a panel of 14 rhesus macaque genomic DNA samples using 3 primer allele-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Wildschutte et al

. Lastly, a recent study identified SERV-K1-like proviruses in a number of OWM species, including multiple macaque species, geladas, and olive baboons; this study also reported that many of these proviruses had very similar LTRs, suggestive of recent integration ( van der Kuyl, 2021 ). Overall, these studies indicate the potential for recent HML-2 activity in multiple catarrhine primate species, including rhesus macaques

. None of the proviruses have orthologous insertions in macaques, and they cluster within the OWM SERV-K/MER11 clade in pol and LTR trees, specifically clustering with a clade of SERV-K/MER11 proviruses in the GSM genome ( Figure 5A, B ). These characteristics all strongly suggest that these proviruses are the result of an interspecies transmission from an OWM to an ancestral gibbon species

. This timing is supported by estimated integration times of these ancient elements based on sequence divergence of their 5′ and 3′ LTRs. The majority of the 106 recombinant proviruses so far identified in rhesus genomes are much younger, however, including two subclades of rhesus-specific insertions. Many of these young proviruses are insertionally polymorphic and present at low frequencies in macaques, and 36 of them have identical LTRs

. Although we were unable to identify any orthologues of the oldest SERV-K/MER11 insertions in ape genomes, and BLAT searches using SERV-K1 as a query confirmed the absence of similar recombinant proviruses in great apes, to our surprise, a BLAT search of the northern white-cheeked gibbon ( Nomascus leucogenys ) genome revealed a number of SER-K-like provir. These provuses cluster within the O recombinant clade in pol and L trees, indicating interspecies transmission from an OWM to gibbon. This is the first evidence of interspecies transmission of a virus in the HER-K H-2 clade, and raises a number of interesting questions, most notably whether macques or other O species contain actively replicating SER-KER viruses, and whether those are capable of interspecies transmission

The LTRs of the youngest provir have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Response Element (RE ) required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the H-8 region functions as a constitutive transport element ( CTE ) indicating the ancestral–RE export system was replaced by C mechanism.

    Abstract: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enterococcus faecalis is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23, 000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections.

However, these studies have primarily focused on cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome of intact skin or uninfected wounds, offering limited insights into the dynamics of wound healing following infection. Efficient healing during wound infections involves a sequence of events occurring in three distinct but interconnected stages: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling ( Eming et al., 2014; Masson-Meyers et al., 2020; Minutti et al

Understanding cell-cell crosstalk through ligand-receptor interactions allows predicting ligand-target links between interacting cells by combining their expression data with signaling and gene regulatory network databases

Our data reveal unique clusters enriched within keratinocytes and fibroblasts in E. faecalis-infected wounds, suggesting an immunosuppressive transcriptional program in these cell populations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ). Given the ability of E. faecalis to actively suppress macrophage activation in vitro ( Tien et al., 2017 ), we investigated if E

These findings demonstrate that keratinocytes exist in a low inflammation profile under homeostasis, which is exacerbated upon E. faecalis infection. Fibroblasts are the fundamental connective tissue cells involved in skin homeostasis and healing

Overall, E. faecalis infection altered the transcriptome of keratinocytes toward a partial EMT at an early stage, whereas uninfected keratinocytes showed differentiating and terminally differentiated keratinocyte populations ( Figure 2M ).

. Next, we focused on the functions of infection-specific macrophage clusters 2 and 5 ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) to identify their potential roles in wound infection. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that these macrophages were involved in the immune response, ECM production, and protein translation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ), however, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.

   . Our experiments reveal the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors. What is the ecological relevance of the clocked temporal kinetics of defense activation in neighboring plants? We propose several hypotheses. First, responding most strongly to volatile cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure ( Waterman et al., 2019; Mithöfer et al., 2005 )

. We find that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day. Here, we discuss the mechanisms and biological implications of this phenomenon. Plants are well known to respond to herbivore-induced volatiles by increasing their own defenses. Defense activation can happen directly, with plants increasing their defense hormone production and volatile release ( Engelberth et al

. To test this hypothesis, we exposed receiver plants to volatiles from control plants or volatiles from herbivory-induced plants for 1. 25 hr. We then disconnected the receiver plants and exposed them to clean air for 17 hr, until the beginning of the next day. Half of the plants were then exposed to HAC as a secondary trigger. HAC was selected as an inducer as it showed the strongest correlation with all measured terpenes ( Figure 6 )

. Based on the above observations, we reasoned that, under natural conditions, the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of an initial volatile burst that primes plants for higher volatile release at the onset of the second day, and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive volatiles released from sender plants at the onset of the second day

When maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes ( Hu et al., 2019; Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). To understand the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we conducted a detailed time-course analysis of terpene release by receiver plants exposed to volatiles from sender plants under attack by Spodoptera exigua caterpillars ( Figure 1 )

. Finally, we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming. Together, our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer.

. Interestingly, as soon as the light was restored, we observed a strong burst of terpene release from receiver plants, which was two to five times higher than the release the day before ( Figure 1 ). Thus, exposure to volatiles from a herbivore-attacked plant triggers a delayed burst in terpene emission in neighboring plants. Why do receiver plants show a delayed burst in volatile-induced terpenoid release? During the night, plants close their stomata to limit water loss ( Caird et al

. In darkness, the emission of many volatiles, especially those released via stomata, is severely hindered ( Seidl-Adams et al., 2015; He et al., 2021; Bläsing et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2022 ). In order to understand the kinetics of information transfer between plants and the importance of dynamic temporal emission patterns, we monitored the emission kinetics of terpenes as a marker of defense activation in maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs

. At the beginning of the next day, we found a slight induction in terpene emissions, most apparent for sesquiterpenes and TMTT, in plants that had been exposed to herbivory-induced volatiles 18 hr prior ( Figure 7, Table 2 ). HAC exposure at the beginning of the next day also induced terpene emissions. Furthermore, HAC induced a stronger release of all terpenes in plants that had been exposed to HIPVs the previous day

. We leveraged a highly temporally resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time. We further measured foliar terpene pools, stress hormones, and defense gene expression in receiver plants, and determined the impact of day:night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics

. It is possible that stomata, which are closed in the dark, delay the onset of the terpene burst under dark:light transitions. A simple explanation for the delayed volatile burst may be that the bioactive volatiles are more strongly emitted from sender plants at the onset of day 2, thus triggering a stronger volatile response in the receiver plants at this time. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed volatile emission kinetics of S. exigua-infested plants over time

Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount appropriate responses to herbivores ( Waterman et al., 2019; Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023 ). Among these cues are herbivore-induced plant volatiles ( HIPVs ) ( Meents and Mithöfer, 2020; Karban, 2021 ). When perceived by undamaged plants, HIPVs can enhance plant defenses, and thus increase plant resistance to future herbivory ( Erb et al., 2015; Kalske et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Engelberth et al

. Further experiments will reveal whether similar patterns are observed in other plants, and how they may operate on a mechanistic level. Additionally, considering we observed an induction in jasmonates coinciding with terpene bursts it is likely that non-volatile jasmonate-dependent defenses follow similar temporal patterns

., 2012 ). We found a significant induction of OPDA and JA-Ile production as well as OPR7 expression at the beginning of the second day, 22 hr after the onset of volatile exposure ( Figure 3, Table 1 ). Thus, jasmonate production is temporally aligned with the delayed terpene burst at the onset of the second day. To test whether the delayed burst in terpene volatiles is linked to light:dark transitions, we exposed maize plants to HIPVs under continuous light

., 2019 ). Given these considerations, together with the observed volatile release, response kinetics, and our manipulative experiments, we can draw up the following scenario: On day 1, maize plants are exposed to GLVs, which trigger a small burst of terpene release in receiver plants. At the same time, receiver plants are primed to respond more strongly on the next day, once light is restored. At the onset of the second day, four things happen simultaneously

., 2015; Yu et al., 2017 ), which, again, is likely to influence defense responses in receiver plants. Green leaf volatiles ( GLVs ), including ( Z ) -3-hexenyl acetate ( HAC ), ( Z ) -3-hexenal, and ( Z ) -3-hexen-1-ol, are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage ( D’Auria et al., 2007; Matsui, 2006 ). Indole and terpenes are emitted within hours of herbivore attack ( Escobar-Bravo et al

. Interestingly, this was not the case under continuous light, where the apex of bioactive volatile emission in sender plants was not temporally aligned with the apex of terpene responses in receiver plants ( Figure 6 ). Sender plant emissions even showed slight negative correlations with terpene induction in receiver plants under continuous light. Thus, the emission kinetics of bioactive volatiles from sender plants cannot fully explain the delayed terpene burst

. Herbivore feeding began around 12:00 and within 3 hr, we detected a small induction of sesquiterpenes [C15H25+, m/z=205. 20], and TMT [CH3H+ m/z 205.20 ] in receiver plants exposed to volat from herboreatt plants ( Figure 7, Table 2 ). At the beginning of the next day, we observed a strong induction of sesiterpen and TMT in plants that had been exposed to volat from herbore plants 18 hr prior. H exposure at the beginning of the next day also induced sesquiter and TMT in plants that had been exposed to vol from herbore the previous day.
Researchers have found evidence of recursive vocal patterns in the calls of wild orangutans, a non-human great ape, that are similar to those found in human language and music. These patterns, known as isochrony, involve rhythmic sequences nested within rhythmic sequences, and are consistent with a hierarchical structure. The findings suggest that recursion, a key feature of human language, may have evolved from proto-musical expression in human ancestors. The study analyzed the calls of flanged male orangutans in the wild, using precise rhythm analysis, and found that three acoustically distinct rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm of the higher stratum by multiples, indicating that these structures were not the result of non-hierarchical processes or anatomical constraints. The discovery of recursive patterns in a great ape in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music opens a new charter for incipient and transitional states of recursion among homids. The findings imply that sequences within sequences may have been present in ancestral homids, and second-order sequences may have predated the emergence of language in the human lineage. The study also suggests a possible link between great ape calls and music, as loud calling is an archetyp trait in primates and ancient homids, and could have preceded and transmuted into modern vocal structures in humans. The presence of tempor recursive motifs in a great ape revolutionizes how to approach the evolution of recursion along the human lineage beyond all-orthing accounts.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

   ., 2007 ). Therefore, these results prompted us to investigate whether MDA5, a structurally similar homolog to RIG-I, can substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA in vertebrates without RIG-I ( Figure 1J ). To further investigate the alternative immune function of MDA5, we first investigated the M. miiuy MDA5-mediated signaling pathway in response to SCRV virus and double-stranded mimetic poly ( I:C ) -HMW infection

. Next, by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates, we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event: In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution, MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I

., 2022 ). Therefore, in this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker ( Miichthys miiuy ) and bird chicken ( Gallus gallus ), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses ( SCRV and VSV ), to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that the MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA

., 2010 ). Furthermore, SCRV virus, the virus model used in this study, mainly affects the Siniperca chuatsi, which is a fish species that also lacks RIG-I like M. miiuy ( Liu et al., 2023 ). Viruses are constantly co-evolving with hosts. Our available data suggested that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA virus in the absence of RIG-I

. In addition, SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m6A strategy to degrade MDA5 of M. miiuy for immune evasion. In summary, these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates. In addition, since the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, our research also provides a new perspective for vertebrate groups that have lost RIG-I.

. Specifically, we conducted an evolutionary analysis and provided functional evidence to confirm that MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus has acquired an additional function of sensing 5’ppp-RNA, thus compensating for the loss of RIG-I. Additionally, we found that SCRV infection can regulate the m6A level of MDA5 in the M. miiuy, leading to its degradation and subsequently affecting the immune response for immune evasion

. As a result, there was functional redundancy of RIG-I, which eventually led to its gradual disappearance from the vertebrate genome. This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints: first, MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses Schoggins et al., 2015; secondly, in fish without RIG-I deficiency, MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I ( Wan et al., 2017 )

., 2021; Walker et al., 2022 ). 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) to maintain organismal balance

. It is plausible that SCRV also impacts the production of antiviral genes, such as IFN-1 or other cytokines, by manipulating m6A modification on the transcripts of cytokines or molecules involved in their production. This interesting aspect warrants further investigation in future research. In this study, we demonstrated a co-evolutionary arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and virus receptors

. As stated in the previous results, MDA5 has evolved to possess immune recognition abilities that take over the role of RIG-I, significantly enhancing the host’s ability to resist viral infections. However, evolution is a continuous battle between hosts and viruses, viruses often evolve complex escape mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and destruction, in which the m6A modification mechanism is an important way

. This complex formation was inhibited by adding an excess of cold 5’ppp-SCRV but not 5’-OH-SCRV and 5’pppGG-SCRV, demonstrating the direct interaction between mmiMDA5 and 5’ppp-SCRV ( Figure 4G ). However, 5’ppp-SCRV cannot bind to the MDA5-ΔRD ( Figure 4H ). Next, we investigated whether G. gallus MDA5 ( ggaMDA5 ) shares the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA seen in fish

. However, one RIG-I gene was lost in the downstream region of TOPORSa, indicating that one of the RIG-I copies has been lost in zebrafish, similar to M. miiuy. Given the important role of RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp RNA, we selected two different models for experiments to detect the presence of other potential receptors for immune compensation in RIG-I-deficient species

. In this study, we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the M. miiuy and G. gallus ( two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I ) and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5

. Previous research has revealed that in T. belangeri, concurrent with the loss of RIG-I, both MDA5 and LGP2 have undergone notable positive selection, and MDA5 or MDA5/LGP2 could sense Sendai virus ( an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist ) for inducing type I IFN. This proposed an immune substitution model for RIG-I deficiency in mammals, though direct evidence of MDA5/LGP2 binding to 5’ppp-RNA was lacking

. Finally, through the determination of IRF3 dimer and IFN induction, our results showed that the induction of antiviral innate immunity by SCRV-RNA depends on MDA5 ( Figure 2P and Q ). Overall, these findings indicated that MDA5 plays a positive role in regulating the antiviral responses of M. miiuy. We investigated whether M. miiuy MDA5, in the absence of RIG-I, can directly bind to the RNA of SCRV

. We synthesized 67 nt 5’ppp-VSV from the VSV virus and found that it is similar to 5’ppp-SCRV, binding to ggaMDA5 and activating IRF3 in a triphosphate-dependent manner ( 4I-4M ). Overall, our findings demonstrated that MDA5 detection of RNA in two RIG-I deficient vertebrates ( M. miiuy and G. gallus ) is guided by the RNA 5'-triphosphate end and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5'-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated

. And further qPCR experiments showed that the induction ability of IFN-1 by SCRV-RNA is significantly higher than that of SCRV-RNA-CIAP ( Figure 1E ). These results indicate the presence of viral receptors in M. miiuy and G. gallus that can recognize 5’ppp-RNA. Next, we compared the structural domains of human RIG-I and M. miiuy MDA5 ( mmiMDA5 ) and LGP2 ( mmiLG2 ) and found that miMD5 and miLG2 are structurally homologous to R-I ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that mi5 and mi2 could be functional substitutes for R-I in recognizing 5pp-RNA

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that M5 of M. mii and G gallus can recognize 5pp-RNA in the absence of R-I, providing an explanation for the loss of R-I from the vertebrate genome.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Among its extragonadal effects, follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism. Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations, this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ), lean body mass ( LBM ), and bone fragility induced by ADT. The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters, bone mineral density ( BMD ), and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT. Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study. All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. FBM, LBM, and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. For outcome measurements and statistical analysis, t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated. At baseline conditions, a weak, non-significant, direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 006 ), fat mass at arms ( r = 0. 54, p = 0. 004 ), and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 018 ) assessed after 12 months. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0. 64, p = 0. 001 ). This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation. FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. This research was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals. The funder had no role in design and conduct of the study, collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data and in preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. clinicalTrials. gov NCT03202381, EudraCT Number 2016-004210-10.

   . We recently conducted the BLADE study ( Bone mineraL mAss Dexa dEgarelix ), a prospective phase IV study designed to obtain explorative information on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measurement changes in lean body mass ( LBM ) and fat body mass ( FBM ) in patients with non-metastatic PC treated with degarelix, an LHRH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) antagonist that has been developed to achieve effective long-term medical castration without the risk of testosterone surge

., 2021 ). The impact of FSH on body composition may at least partially explain the observed correlation between FSH levels and the risk of cardiovascular events ( Munir et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2013; El Khoudary et al., 2016 ). Studies clarifying the relationship among FSH, body composition measures, and BMD in prostate cancer ( PC ) patients are lacking

., 2019; Abufaraj et al., 2021 ). Unlike other settings, FSH values before and after degarelix did not correlate with either BMD or bone turnover markers. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing an association between circulating FSH levels and body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. However, this study suffers from all the limitations of ancillary studies. Therefore, the results obtained are to be considered as hypothesis generating and cannot be generalized

. Large epidemiologic data have shown significant reductions in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and high resorption rates 2–3 years prior to menopause, when FSH serum levels are increasing, which is also associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity ( Thurston et al., 2009; Senapati et al., 2014 )

. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ) ( Table 1 ). The correlation between circulating FSH levels at 6 and 12 months, bone turnover markers evaluated at the same time, BMD and body composition parameters assessed after 12 months is shown in Table 2. FSH serum levels assessed after 6 months of degarelix administration showed a direct relationship with total FBM ( r = 0. 49, p = 0. 008 ) and with fat mass evaluated at arms ( r = 0. 53, p = 0. 004 ), trunk ( r = 0. 48, p = 0

. Likewise, the interaction between the variation of FSH serum levels and the modification of these parameters in PC patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is not known

Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) exerts effects beyond those on gonadal tissue, which have been known for a long time ( Lizneva et al., 2019 ). In the animal model, FSH has been observed to stimulate osteoclastic activity and therefore to exert a negative role on bone mass ( Sun et al., 2006; Zaidi et al., 2023; Gera et al., 2022 )

., 2023 ). However, the determinants of altered body composition in male hypogonadism and in ADTs have not been completely defined. As a matter of fact, low testosterone values do not seem to be the only determinant of sarcopenic obesity in males with hypogonadism. In this context, FSH values might play a role. In fact, among its extragonadal effects, FSH directly affects adipogenesis, lean mass and bone turnover ( Liu et al., 2017; Rojekar et al., 2023; Zaidi et al

., 2009; Senapati et al., 2014 ). A longitudinal study involving post-menopausal women has shown that increases in circulating FSH levels were associated with greater increases in the percentage of total body fat, total body fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( Mattick et al., 2022 ). Moreover, clinical studies have found that FSH is also involved in the modulation of lean mass

. According to these data, small changes in FSH can result in significant changes in body composition in a condition of androgen and estrogen deprivation. However, since sex hormones were not measured in our patients, it was unclear whether the possible variability in testosterone values during degarelix treatment ( Kamada et al., 2024 ) might have influenced the detrimental effects of FSH and body composition

., 2023; Gera et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, FSH was found to have a positive action on adipocytes and the blockade of FSH induced by antibodies against FSH receptor caused an increase in bone mass and a reduction of body fat ( Liu et al., 2017; Rojekar et al., 2023 ). These preclinical data were confirmed in clinical studies

At baseline conditions no relationship was found between FSH serum levels and the following DXA-derived parameters: BMD at left hip and spine, total FBM, total LBM, lean mass at arms and legs, ALMI, ALMI/FBM ratio, and android/gynoid ratio. No correlation was also found between FSH serum levels and serum levels of either ALP or CTX. A direct relationship, although not significant, was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ) ( Table 1 )

. In this context, it is reasonable to hypothesize that variable values of FSH might directly influence body composition and skeletal fragility. This ancillary analysis of the BLADE study shows that higher serum levels of FSH during degarelix treatment were significantly associated with higher total, limbs, and trunk fat mass. Moreover, higher FSH values under ADT were associated with lower ALMI/FBM ratio, a parameter that identifies patients at high risk for sarcopenic obesity

. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that FSH serum levels after ADT could impact body composition – FBM in particular – in PC patients undergoing ADT. Of course further investigation is required to establish the association between FSH serum levels, measured during ADT, and sarcopenic obesity risk in PC patients. However, this is an area of great interest

. We can infer therefore that the effect was caused by the direct relationship of FBM since there was no correlation between lean mass and FSH in this study. These associations were not significant before starting degarelix, suggesting that sex hormones might counteract the effects of F on body composition.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.

   ., 2021; Zamiri et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Meissner et al., 1999 ). The effect of RyR2 inhibition on ventricular arrhythmias and non-ischemic HF has been unexplored. We hypothesized that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function

To study the effects of RyR2 leak inhibition on SCD and HF, we leveraged a pressure overload guinea pig model of HF/SCD with spontaneous arrhythmias. Unique to this model is the high incidence of premature ventricular contractions ( PVCs ) and VT/VF, leading to SCD in about two-thirds of the animals within 4 weeks. Notably, the SCD occurs early on, in the first 2 weeks over the course of cardiac hypertrophy, even before the heart dilates or progresses into failure ( Dey et al

. In our previous report, we noted HF-associated changes in both expression and phospho-proteome of key ion channels, transporters, and excitation contraction-coupling proteins. In particular, hyperphosphorylation of several RyR2 sites was noted in failing hearts when compared to normal ( Dey et al., 2018; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). A targeted antioxidant therapy prevented these modifications, pointing to oxidative damage as the primary cause

Damage caused by oxidative stress alters the proteomic profile of the cell, including altering expression levels as well as the structure and function of EC-coupling proteins. This study demonstrates that inhibition of Ca2+ leak via RyR2 pauses the transition to heart failure by reducing cardiac fibrosis, increasing repolarization lability, and decreasing QT heterogeneity, improving chronotropic competency, ultimately improving LV contractility, and mitigating lethal VT/VF

. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD. A growing body of evidence indicates that sympathetic stress-induced hyperactivity of the RyR2, located in the SR of cardiac myocytes, causes SR Ca2+ leak, which contributes to the pathogenesis of VT/VF and SCD ( Fischer et al., 2013; Alvarado and Valdivia, 2020; Wehrens et al., 2006; Eisner et al., 2009 )

., 2006; Eisner et al., 2009 ). During systole, the release of Ca2+ by the RyR2 plays a pivotal role in myocyte excitation-contraction coupling. The degree of contractility is determined by the amount of Ca2+ in the SR and by the timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release. In diseased and/or stressed hearts, PKA-mediated hyper-phosphorylation and ROS-mediated oxidation results in a leaky RyR2 ( Echt et al., 1991 ), which allows Ca2+ to leak out of SR during diastole

. The consequent reduction in SR Ca2+ load weakens systolic contraction. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels also leads to DADs, which can trigger atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( Al-Khatib et al., 2018; Wehrens, 2007; Hamilton et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020 ). Recent evidence suggests that dantrolene, a RyR2 inhibitor, reduces the inducibility of atrial fibrillation in animals with myocardial infarction ( Azam et al., 2021; Zamiri et al., 2014; Chou et al

. 28 ± 0. 16; p<0. 005 ). DS treatment not only restored the chronotropic response to stress but also reduced the incidences of VT/VF and SCD. To understand this protective mechanism, we next tested the hypothesis that DS prevents VT/VF and SCD by preventing repolarization abnormalities. Detailed analysis of the ECG features revealed how inhibition of the RyR2 leak with DS prevents VT/VF and SCD. QT variability and prolongation are known to have prognostic significance in failing hearts

. 35 ± 0. 02 vs -0. 58 ± 0. 02, p<0. 001 ). Inhibiting RyR2 with DS reduced the dispersion of repolarization/QT variability, demonstrating a central role of diastolic calcium in increasing cardiac repolarization lability, and terminating triggered activity. A crossover study was designed where ( i ) only vehicle was administered until the endpoint i. e

., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Vaseghi et al., 2017; Yalin et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2019; Zanoni et al., 2017; Tygesen et al., 1999 ). Antiarrhythmic drugs, which target ion channels, may confer acute benefits but can also be proarrhythmic, triggering VT/VF. Importantly, most antiarrhythmic drugs worsen survival over the longer term ( Echt et al., 1991; The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial II Investigators, 1992 )

. Taken together, RyR2 inhibition with DS is effective both in the early and late stages of HF, preventing VT/VF and SCD and improving cardiac contractile function.

. Therefore, we tested if DS therapy prevented the downstream oxidative damages by quantifying the oxidation profile of RyR2 with and without DS. RyR2 oxidation was significantly reduced in HF+DS group as compared to HF group ( Figure 3C ). As per our experimental protocol, all groups of animals received a daily low dosage of isoproterenol bolus for 1 hr. As anticipated, the heart rate was elevated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation and recovered to resting heart rate 3–4 hr later

. While prolonged QTc is considered a risk factor for arrhythmias, QT heterogeneity as an add-on is a surrogate for lethal VT/VF ( Cvijić et al., 2018 ). The HF group displayed prolonged QTc, increased QT variability and repolarization abnormalities ( Figure 5A ). The guinea pig model of HF exhibits prolonged QTc, as shown in our previous studies ( Dey et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014 )

SCD in heart failure ( HF ) is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Current therapies for preventing SCD due to VT/VF are limited. For example, ICDs, the only effective therapy for VT/VF and SCD, are palliative, expensive, and pose several risks. Moreover, many patients suffer from VT/VF and SCD in the early stages of HF before they become eligible to receive an ICD ( Aziz et al. 2018; et al. 2018; et al. 2018; et al 2018; et al 2018; et al 2018; et al 2018; al 2018; et 2018; al 2018; et 201; al 2018; et 201; al 2018; et 201; al 201;201; al 201;201; al 201;201; al201;201; al201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;

    Title: 
    Abstract: Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In C. elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.

   . In contrast, Schnurri proteins are transcriptional partners that co-regulate target genes across multiple cell types. Here, we used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva. We chose the second larval ( L2 ) stage because Smad activity is elevated at this stage as determined by the RAD-SMAD activity reporter ( Tian et al

. Our analysis revealed that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate target genes that they independently and exclusively regulate ( Figure 8 ). ChIP-seq data demonstrated that 73. 7% of SMA-3 binding peaks overlap with SMA-9 binding sites, while approximately half of all SMA-9 binding sites did not overlap with SMA-3 sites

., 2010 ), and because this stage is the earliest point at which one can observe a clear difference for one of the best-studied Smad mutant phenotypes: body size growth. Using ChIP-seq, we detected numerous SMA-3 and SMA-9 binding sites. The large number of sites could reflect the low affinity and degenerate DNA sequence recognition of known targets for their respective families of transcription factors

. A matrix of SMA-3 and SMA-9 peak centroids was then analyzed from this randomized dataset as described above for the actual dataset. To identify SMA-3 direct targets, differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) from the RNA-seq comparison of wild-type versus sma-3 ( wk30 ) using an FDR ≤0. 05 were compared against the genomic coordinates of SMA-3 peaks from the ChIP-seq analysis using BETA basic and the WS245 annotation of the C. elegans genome ( Wang et al., 2013 )

., 2018a; Mallo et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2021; Zugasti and Ewbank, 2009; Ciccarelli et al., 2024a; Ciccarelli et al., 2024b ), these SMA-9-exclusive target genes imply Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in these functions. A Smad-independent role for SMA-9 in immunity is consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity ( Jones and Glimcher, 2010 ), which have not been reported to overlap with TGF-β-regulated functions

. With either possibility, SMA-9 represses the expression of these genes in the absence of SMA-3. DBL-1 signaling regulates multiple developmental and physiological processes in C. elegans, including body size, lipid metabolism, innate immunity, and male tail development. Our samples were not enriched for males, precluding an analysis of targets involved in male tail development

. In this study, we use BETA software to combine RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets for SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri to identify direct versus indirect target genes of these factors, as well as to identify common versus unique targets ( Vora et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2013 ). Analysis of sma-3; sma-9 double mutants further extends our understanding of how these factors interact to produce locus-specific effects on target genes

., 2013 ). The BETA analysis identified 367 direct targets for SMA-3 and 332 direct targets for SMA-9 ( Supplementary file 3 ). Every identified direct target of SMA-3 was downregulated in the sma-3 mutant ( Figure 2b ), indicating that SMA-3/Smad functions primarily as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, 46% of direct targets of SMA-9 were upregulated and 53% were downregulated in the sma-9 mutant ( Figure 2d, Supplementary file 3 )

. TGF-β family members are well-known regulators of collagen deposition and extracellular matrix composition, suggesting that this class of transcriptional targets is conserved over evolutionary time ( Kim et al., 2018; MacFarlane et al., 2017 ). Thus, it is likely that the multi-level interactions identified in C. elegans are also relevant to the functions of these factors in vertebrates.

., 2006; Clark et al., 2018a ). We provided these constructs to the modENCODE/modERN consortium, which then analyzed genome binding via ChIP-seq at the second larval ( L2 ) stage, a developmental stage at which a Smad reporter is highly active, and both SMA-3 and SMA-9 are first observed to affect body size ( Kudron et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2010 ). ChIP sequencing reads identified 4205 peaks for GFP::SMA-3 and 7065 peaks for SMA-9::GFP ( Supplementary file 1 )

., 2007 ). Most co-regulated genes were activated by both SMA-3 and SMA-9, with a small subset activated by SMA-3 and repressed by SMA-9. We used double mutant analysis of sma-3; sma-9 animals to determine how these factors interact to produce normal body size

. Further investigation will be needed to determine if SMA-3 and SMA-9 form a direct complex at these sites, and whether the presence of one factor affects the binding of the other. Our combined BETA and LOA analysis further demonstrated that SMA-3/Smad acts primarily as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri can function as either an activator or a repressor depending on the locus

. elegans genome ( Wang et al., 2013 ). The following parameters were used: 3 kb from TSS, FDR cutoff of 0. 05, and one-tail KS test cutoff of 0. 05. The input files consisted of. bed files of IDR thresholded peaks and differential expression Log2FC and FDR values from the RNA-seq. An identical approach was used to identify SMA-9 direct targets using DEGs from the RNA-seq comparison of wild-type versus sma-9 ( ok1628 )

., 2002; Oukka et al., 2004 ). It will be interesting to determine whether the SMA-9/Schnurri-exclusive target genes are responsive to TGF-β signals and/or to other signaling ligands. GO term analysis readily identified target genes involved in lipid metabolism and pathogen response, but target genes required for body size regulation remain more difficult to predict based on sequence alone

., 2003; Clark et al., 2018a ). SMA-9 is the homolog of Drosophila Schnurri, which was identified for its roles in Dpp/BMP signaling ( Staehling-Hampton et al., 1995; Grieder et al., 1995; Arora et al., 1995 ). Three vertebrate Schnurri homologs regulate immunity, adipogenesis, and skeletogenesis, acting through both BMP-dependent and BMP-independent mechanisms ( Jin et al., 2006; Jones and Glimcher, 2010; Jones et al., 2006; Steinfeld et al., 2016 )

. SMA-3 and SMA-9 both regulate body size, and a loss of function mutation in either gene results in a small body size phenotype ( Savage et al., 1996; Foehr et al., 2006 ). We found that SMA-9 partially suppresses the small body phenotype of sma-3, indicating some level of antagonism between these factors.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

   . We verified that DUX4 expression in the advanced urothelial carcinoma tumors was associated with an immune exclusion phenotype: a higher proportion of DUX4+ tumors exhibit either an immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotype compared to malignancies where DUX4 is silent ( Figure 2F, Figure 2—figure supplement 1F ). We similarly examined the correlation of DUX4 expression status with PD-L1 levels in the tumor and immune compartments quantified via IHC

DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastasis and may be an important driver of immune evasion. While the mechanism governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer remains to be elucidated, we show that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models ( Chew et al., 2019 ), and is correlated with decreased patient survival under ICI treatment

., 2020 ). These analyses suggest that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, concordant with its established function in inhibiting JAK–STAT signaling in primary cancers ( Chew et al., 2019 ). We hypothesized that DUX4 expression in these cancers will generate related transcriptomic signals consistent with CD8+ T cell exclusion from the tumor

. First, urothelial cancers exhibited one of the highest frequencies of DUX4 expression ( 54% of patients ) in any of the five metastatic cancer cohorts that we analyzed, suggesting that DUX4 could be particularly important in that tumor type

. These data demonstrate that the high rates of DUX4 expression that we observed across metastatic cancer cohorts reflect true DUX4 expression rather than technical biases introduced by studying formalin-fixed tissues and are consistent with expression of a polyadenylated DUX4 transcript in both primary and metastatic cancers. We next sought to assess the downstream consequences of DUX4 expression in metastatic cancers. We focused on urothelial cancers for two reasons

., 2019 ). In our current study, we comprehensively demonstrate that DUX4 modulates patient response to PD-L1 blockade. We also report that DUX4 expression in metastasis is correlated with downregulation of TIGIT ( Zhang et al., 2018 ) and other immune checkpoints whose interception are currently under clinical investigation: HAVCR2/TIM3 ( NCT02608268; Dixon et al., 2021 ) and LAG3 ( NCT02658981; Amaria et al., 2022; Tawbi et al., 2022 )

. For instance, DUXB is expressed in diverse primary malignancies, most notably in testicular germ cell and breast carcinomas ( Preussner et al., 2018 ). Recent work from our group and others showed that DUX4 is expressed in a small subset of primary tumors, where it suppresses tumor cell antigen presentation and response to IFN-γ signaling ( Chew et al., 2019; Spens et al., 2023 )

., 2010 ). Since DUX4 expression in cancer cells suppresses MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation ( Chew et al., 2019 ), we hypothesized that DUX4 expression might be particularly common in the setting of metastatic disease ( vs. the primary cancers that we studied previously ), where immune evasion is particularly important. We therefore analyzed several large cohorts of patients with different metastatic cancers to determine the frequency of DUX4 expression in advanced disease

. Overall, our analyses demonstrate a significant and robust decrease in survival attributable to DUX4 expression in advanced cancers.

. We determined that DUX4 expression was associated with a significant decrease in PD-L1 levels on both tumor and host immune cells, consistent with DUX4-induced suppression of IFN-γ signaling ( Figure 2G, H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H ). PD-L1 expression on immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages modulate anti-tumor immune suppression and response to ICI in in vivo mouse models ( Lau et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Noguchi et al., 2017 )

., 2022; Tawbi et al., 2022 ). Second, the pervasive expression of DUX4 in all the metastatic cohorts we examined exhibits its potential as a pan-cancer biomarker. We show that binary categorization of patients according to DUX4 expression status was sufficient to stratify patients according to ICI response. Screening for DUX4 tumor expression, with binarized results such as through IHC using anti-DUX4 antibodies, could have clinical utility

., 2018; Noguchi et al., 2017 ). Importantly, PD-L1 levels on immune cells are correlated with response to ICI in clinical trials ( Powles et al., 2014; Rosenberg et al., 2016 ). Given the correlation between cancer DUX4 expression and signatures of anti-tumor immune response suppression, we sought to understand if DUX4 expression in patient tumors was associated with accompanying changes to overall survival during PD-L1 inhibition

. We found that DUX4 expression is a particularly common feature across advanced-stage cancers, with 10–50% of cancer samples ( depending upon cancer type ) displaying DUX4 expression levels comparable to or greater than those observed in the early embryo, where expression of the highly stereotyped DUX4-induced gene expression program is observed ( Chew et al., 2019; Hendrickson et al., 2017 )

., 2017 ). Utilizing a chemokine signature associated with host immune response to solid tumors, we observed that DUX4 expression was correlated with broad reduction in the expression of chemokine signaling genes, beyond T cell-associated signals ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E; Coppola et al., 2011 )

. Using an IFN-γ gene signature predictive of response to blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, we found that DUX4-expressing cancers have statistically lower levels of IFN-γ activity ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B; Ayers et al., 2017 )

. Second, pretreatment samples from 347 patients enrolled in the IMvigor210 trial, a phase 2 trial of anti-PD-L1 ( atezolizumab ) therapy with advanced urothelial carcinoma, were subject to transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq as well as immunohistochemical analysis, enabling us to conduct comprehensive studies of the association between DUX4 expression, the global transcriptome, and immunophenotypes in a well-powered cohort ( Balar et al., 2017; Mariathasan et al

. We assessed this using an effector CD8+ T cell transcriptomic signature developed from initial studies of the IMvigor210 phase 2 trial ( Balar et al., 2017; Rosenberg et al., 2016 ). DUX4-expressing cancers had lower measures of the gene signature, consistent with decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumor ( Figure 2C )

., 2011 ). We directly assessed the correlation of DUX4 expression to immune cell exclusion by examining CD8+ T cell abundance in the tumor microenvironment, measured by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded patient tumor sections

., 2019; Spens et al., 2023 ). We additionally observed signals that DUX4 expression was associated with reduced survival following response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 in melanoma; however, those analyses relied upon two small cohorts ( n = 27 or 41 patients ), limiting the statistical power of our conclusions. In its native embryonic context, DUX4 initializes human zygotic genome activation

., 2017; Mariathasan et al., 2018; Rosenberg et al., 2016 ). We examined associations between global gene expression profiles and DUX4 expression in this advanced urothelial carcinoma cohort. We performed differential gene expression analyses on the individuals stratified according to tumor DUX4 expression status

Researchers have identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, which is aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors. They found that DUX expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX. DUX expression is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial patients. DUX expression is a predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational and molecular features in this cohort, with DUX expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year.

The researchers verified DUX expression in advanced uroth carcinoma was associated with an immune phenotype, a higher proportion of DUX+ tumors exhibit an immune-excluded or immune-des phenotype compared to malignancies where DUX is silent. They examined the correlation of DUX status with PD-1 levels in the tumor and quantified via IHC. DUX expression is a feature of metastasis and may be an driver of immune evasion. The mechanism governing DUX depression in cancer remains to be elucidated, but DUX expression in metastatic is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring observations in primary and cancer cell models.

In uroth cancers exhibited the highest frequencies of DUX expression, 54% of patients, in the metastatic cohorts analyzed, suggesting DUX could be important in this type. Data demonstrate the rates of DUX expression across metastatic cohorts reflect DUX expression rather than biases introduced by formalin-fixed tissues, consistent with expression of polyadenylated D4 transcript in primary and metastatic cancers. Researchers assessed the consequences of DUX in metastatic cancers, focusing on uroth for reasons. They comprehensively demonstrate DUX modulates response to PD-1 blockade and report DUX expression metast is correlated with downregulation of TIT and other immune checkpoints currently under investigation.

DUX is expressed in primary malignancies, notably testicular cell and breast carcinomas. Recent work showed DUX is in small subset primary, suppresses tumor antigen and response to IF-γ signaling. Since DUX suppresses MHC-mediated presentation, researchers hypothesized DUX might be common in metastatic, where evasion is important. They analyzed large cohorts of patients with metastatic to determine frequency DUX in advanced. Overall, analyses demonstrate significant decrease in survival attributable DUX in cancers. DUX expression associated with decrease PD-1 on tumor and immune, consistent DUX-induced IF- signaling. PD-1 on immune cells modulate anti-tumor response in vivo models.
A study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Livestock abortion is a significant concern for productivity and public health, with several pathogens associated but limited data on aetiology and impacts. The study established a surveillance platform to investigate abortion events reported by farmers and field officers, collecting samples and data on determinants, patterns, and cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved for 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for syndromic event surveillance and effective reporting system operational across settings, including rural areas. 

The study suggests a possible role for stressful events, including drought and wild attacks, reported in unattributed cases. Future research may include surveillance at a larger scale to understand the extent and impact of abortion associations with different systems. The platform was set up through collaboration between the Ministry of Livestock, local authorities, and research. The study was undertaken in 15 wards of five districts in Arush, Kilimanaro, and Many Regions in northern Tanzania. The model assumes better surveillance and community partnerships lead to data-driven interventions to prevent and control causes of abortion and catalyse changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and practices to improve productivity, livelihoods, and health. 

The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through engagement of community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms. Livestock surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not captured through other forms of surveillance. The study showed the practicality and value of establishing a framework to support evidence-based interventions improve development, livelihoods, and health in Africa. Aetiological attribution of abortion rarely exceeds 35% even in well-resourced systems, and is sparse in African systems. The study suggests a possible role for recent events, including drought and attacks, in unattributed cases.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. 

    Supporting Text:
   . These findings revealed the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of the cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, and thus, explains colon cancer development in cigarette smokers. The development of drugs that can block the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers.

., 2016 ). Extrinsic factors, such as NIC, may increase the risk of cancer by promoting stem cell division. Our data indicated that NIC increased the abundance and proliferation of ISCs, which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NIC enhances the ISC population via α7-nAChR as well as Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling

. This model is consistent with DBZ-induced suppression of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs from NIC-treated mice ( Figure 6B ). As NIC effectively expands the ISC population through the upregulated α7-nAChR and the formation of the YAP/TAZ-Notch loop, we speculate these factors to be good therapeutic targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer. In the intestine, YAP activation enhances the expression of both β-catenin and transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling ( Deng et al

. This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.

. In contrast, our analysis validates that NIC affects ISC rather than Panth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated though nAchRa7 by mRNA and protein analyses of sorted ISCs or Paneth cells and ex vivo functional assays. The crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling regulates mammalian intestinal homeostasis ( Totaro et al., 2018; Khoramjoo et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019 )

., 1995 ), which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Rasa, Trp53, and Rb ( Sekido et al., 2003 ). Although NIC itself, the addictive component in cigarette smoke, is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer, it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently ( Schaal and Chellappan, 2014 ). However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited

. Hence, we propose that the increase of ISC activity induced by NIC are not dependent on Paneth cells in functional assays. Furthermore, we traced the signaling pathway in ISCs and detected that ISCs respond to NIC via α7-nAchR, PKC activation, and stimulation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5 ). Consistent with this model, DBZ treatment inhibited Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in mice and prevented NIC-induced ISC expansion and transformation through Apc loss

. Our study demonstrated that NIC increased the expression of YAP/TAZ and Notch target genes, as well as the ISC population. Our ex vivo organoid assay revealed the role of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion. However, the mechanism underlying NIC-activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling also remains unclear. NIC administration can induce the nuclear translocation and activation of YAP in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer ( Zhao et al., 2014 )

. In the intestine, YAP/TAZ regulates Notch signaling ( Zhou et al., 2011 ) and Notch activation can activate YAP/TAZ ( Totaro et al., 2018 ). Consistent with previous reports, our results demonstrate that Notch inhibitor suppresses YAP/TAZ and Notch activities, indicating a positive feedback loop between Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs of NIC mice ( Figure 5G )

., 2018 ). Both the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling pathways regulate intestinal homeostasis via the control of ISC function ( Mo et al., 2014; Sancho et al., 2015 ) and Notch signaling is positively regulated by YAP/TAZ in the intestine ( Zhou et al., 2011 ). Hence, we examined Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. YAP1 and TAZ expression was significantly induced in the crypts of NIC-treated mice ( Figure 4C )

. These outcomes demonstrate that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling pathways are crucial for ISC expansion in NIC-treated mice analyzed in vivo. As ISCs are the potential origin of tumors ( Barker et al., 2009 ), we hypothesized that NIC-induced ISC expansion can promote tumor formation in a tumor-initiating background, such as Apc loss

., 2018 ). Moreover, Notch signaling concomitantly regulates intestinal cell proliferation via Wnt signaling ( Fre et al., 2009 ). NIC is supposed to activate Wnt signaling via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. Similarly, the expression of target proteins ( Sox9, TCF4 and, C-myc ) of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as cell-cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin B, and cyclin E, was up-regulated in crypts obtained from NIC-treated mice in our experiment ( data not shown )

., 2009 ). Hence, we propose the possibility of NIC-induced activation of YAP and ADAM via PKC, leading to Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch activation and ISC expansion. The lifetime risk of various cancers is strongly correlated with frequency of stem cell divisions that maintain tissue homeostasis ( Tomasetti and Vogelstein, 2015 ). However, the risk of cancer associated with stem cell divisions is heavily influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors ( Wu et al., 2016 )

. Notably, Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling were not significantly activated in Paneth cells, indicating that NIC affects α7-nAchR of ISCs rather than Paneth cells. Collectively, these results suggest that NIC induces a Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway in ISCs via activation of α7-nAchR and PKC

. YAP1 and TAZ also upregulated at mRNA level in ISCs from NIC mice ( Figure 4D ). Moreover, activation of Notch signaling in crypts of NIC-treated mice was confirmed through immunoblotting assay ( Figure 4E ). The expression of genes, including Jagged1, HeyL, Hes1, Hes5, and Dll1, involved in Notch signaling, significantly increased in ISCs obtained from NIC-treated mice ( Figure 4D )

Our data propose a model in which NIC enhances the self-renewal of ISCs via activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5G ). Our analyses revealed an increase in the number of ISCs in NIC-treated mice. In contrast to ISCs, Paneth cells showed no increase in cell numbers in NIC-treated mice. Similarly, we assessed the functional ability of ISCs and Paneth cells in terms of ex vivo organoid formation, which indicated a NIC-induced gain-of-function in ISCs but not in Paneth cells

. To validate the significance of Notch signaling in the ISC expansion, NIC-treated mice were subjected to daily IP injection of γ-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) ( 1 mg/kg body weight ) for 2 weeks ( Figure 6A ). We confirmed that DBZ treatment significantly downregulated Hes5 protein expression in the crypts of NIC-treated mice ( Figure 4B ). Notably, DBZ suppressed the expression of YAP and TAZ in NIC-treated mice ( Figure 6B )

., 2019 ), each of which plays a crucial role in the expansion of ISCs. Results indicate that NIC does not induce these cascades and these were not required for the effects of NIC on ISCs. Hence, we conclude that NIC activates the Hippo-Y/TA and Notch signaling in ISCs via α-nAChR and PKC activation, and that this effect is not observed in Pan cells. Our data suggest that NIC-induced expansion of ISCs via Hippo-Y/TA and Notch signaling may contribute to tumorigenesis in the intestine, especially in the absence of tumor suppressor genes such as Apc.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential. 

    Supporting Text:
    Our recent studies showed that during the recovery of aggregated proteins, the Hsp70 chaperone system exhibits different mechanisms of action with class A and class B JDP co-chaperones ( Wyszkowski et al., 2021 ). To better understand the interplay within the Hsp70 chaperone network, we addressed how Hsp110 affects Hsp70 with members of different JDP classes

. This result suggests that the substrate-binding activity specific to Hsp110 is not necessary to increase the Sis1-Ssa1 binding to aggregates and that the effective NEF concentration is negatively correlated with its affinity for Hsp70. Recently, we have reported that larger Hsp70-JDP assemblies at the aggregate surface, dependent on Sis1 and its interaction with EEVD, can modify aggregates into misfolded protein species that are more amenable to disaggregation ( Wyszkowski et al

. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages: chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding ( Figure 5 ). The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase

. This way, Hsp110 may cause the release of Hsp70 from an aggregate, as well as of a JDP, unless it remains tethered via another interaction, e. g., through the other JDP subunit in complex with an aggregate-bound Hsp70 molecule ( Figure 5 ). The fate of the displaced proteins is yet to be established, presumably at low Hsp110 levels, they may re-bind at another site on the substrate or to the aggregate-bound chaperones

. Thus, the positive effect of the Hsp110 NEF on protein recovery from aggregates is substantially more pronounced when the Hsp70 chaperone system comprises a class B JDP. Theoretically, the stimulation by Sse1 might occur at one or many stages of protein disaggregation – starting from the association of the Hsp70 system with an aggregate surface, through polypeptide disentanglement, to the final folding of the released substrate

Our results uncover a comprehensive picture of the role of Hsp110 co-chaperones in aggregate processing by the Hsp70 system. Potentiation of the Hsp70 activity by the NEF strongly depends on the class of the JDP and the preference for class B, conserved in yeast and human orthologs, relies on Hsp70 binding through the EEVD motif

. At high Hsp110 levels, the JDPB-Hsp70 interaction is very strongly affected, similarly as aggregate binding and disaggregation ( Figures 3A, B, D, 4A and B ), suggesting that the proteins released by Hsp110 do not re-bind or that any subsequent binding is non-productive. The apparent competition between the co-chaperones is reflected in the fact that the inhibition by Hsp110 is moderated at increasing Sis1 level ( Figure 4C )

., 2008a; Laufen et al., 1999; Liberek et al., 1991; Mayer and Bukau, 2005; Mayer and Gierasch, 2019 ). In vivo studies on yeast chaperones demonstrated that the Hsp110 co-chaperone Sse1 plays a key role in Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and is essential for protein disaggregation ( Kaimal et al., 2017 )

. Such behaviour would require only a small destabilising effect of the NEF that would not dissociate the complex completely ( Figure 4A ), similarly as observed at the Hsp110 concentration that supports the most effective aggregate binding and disaggregation ( Figure 3A and D ). Further experimental verification of this scenario and future studies of the dynamics within the Hsp70 chaperone system will be critical to understand and combat the stress- and disease-related protein aggregation.

. Furthermore, we elucidate differential contribution of the NEF across different phases of protein recovery from aggregates. We employ biolayer interferometry ( BLI ) to investigate the Hsp110 impact on the formation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface and we assess changes in aggregates’ properties associated with the abundant chaperone binding. Finally, we address a question of the competition between the NEF and JDP co-chaperones

. Interestingly, in the absence of Sse1, the disaggregation rate dropped with increasing Sis1 concentrations and the trend was reversed at higher Sse1 levels, with an inflection point at approximately 0. 5 µM of Sse1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1E ). Thus, Sse1 and Sis1 exhibit an apparent competition for Ssa1 binding. These results indicate that the balance between the JDPs and NEF co-chaperones is critical for the performance of the Hsp70 chaperone system in protein disaggregation.

., 2021 ). To assess whether Hsp110 further stimulates such aggregate-remodelling activity, and this way contributes to the more efficient protein recovery, we used a variant of Hsp104 with abrogated interaction with Hsp70, D484K F508A ( Hsp104mut ). Hsp104mut does not require Hsp70 for allosteric activation and aggregate binding and it can serve as an indicator of Hsp70-dependent aggregate modification by facilitating final reactivation of its products ( Chamera et al., 2019 )

. To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state, eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, and its co-chaperones: an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) and a J-domain protein ( JDP/Hsp40 ), together with an Hsp100 disaggregase ( Glover and Lindquist, 1998 )

. We also gained insight into the biphasic impact of Hsp110: with increasing Sse1 level, the stimulation is overshadowed by inhibition and the contribution of each trend depends on the phase of disaggregation and the composition of the disaggregating system, with a crucial role of the NEF’s affinity for Hsp70. Finally, we show that the disaggregation inhibition by Hsp110 involves disruption of the Hsp70-JDP interaction, suggesting competition between JDP and Hsp110 co-chaperones

., 2006; Shaner et al., 2005 ). It belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily, with identical domain organisation to Hsp70 but distinct size and arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) and substrate-binding domain ( SBD ) ( Easton et al., 2000; Liu and Hendrickson, 2007 ). In contrast to Hsp70, Hsp110 is unable to refold denatured proteins, yet it may bind to and prevent aggregation of certain misfolding substrates ( Garcia et al

. Ydj1, in accordance with the classical model of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle, binds misfolded polypeptides and loads Hsp70 onto aggregates. Unlike that, Sis1 only weakly binds protein substrates but due to the more complex interaction with Hsp70, it loads more Hsp70 molecules onto aggregates, which results in more efficient disaggregation ( Wyszkowski et al., 2021 ). Despite the vast knowledge on how Hsp110 serves as a regulator of the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 ( Andréasson et al

., 2015 ). Class B JDPs are additionally regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism, in which Hsp70 binding by the J-domain is restricted by a neighbouring helix. Upon binding to the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70, the J-domain is released and it can interact with the NBD of Hsp70 ( Faust et al., 2020; Wentink et al., 2020 ). We have recently shown that the yeast class A JDP Ydj1 and class B JDP Sis interact differently with Hsp ( Wzkowski et al.,202 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions, such as knee arthropathy. Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response. However, clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff required. Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges. In this work, we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard. To achieve this, we constructed a machine learning model, trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls. This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0. 86; area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0. 90 ) and of a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0. 83; auPR = 0. 86 ). After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements, we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods, adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines, and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments, with the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.

   . We next looked to quantify how well force plate data can identify disease using gait signatures and to understand if a wearable insole could detect similar characterizations. To differentiate controls versus knee arthropathies using vGRF data, we divided the complete vGRF force plate dataset into a training/validation set ( 85% ) and a test set ( 15% ) and trained a support vector machine ( SVM ) model to predict these classes ( Figure 2D )

. We also aimed to clinically validate the measurement of gait with digital insoles in those with knee arthropathy through ( 1 ) development of a novel ML framework ( based on ‘gold-standard’ force plate data ) for application within digital insoles to detect knee arthropathy status and ( 2 ) processed digital insole-derived gait outcomes and raw sensor signals to identify disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy

. However, clinical application of wearable digital insoles for gait analysis in knee OA is limited by a paucity of analytical validation data ( including face, criterion, and construct validity ), such as comparison of gait outcome measures in those with knee OA to ‘gold-standard’ laboratory references ( e. g., force plate outcomes ) ( Goldsack et al., 2020; Rochester et al., 2020 )

. We found that for the digital insole an SVM model trained only on force plate data performed as well on the digital insole data ( left knee: auROC = 0. 93, auPR = 0. 94; right knee: auROC = 0. 93, auPR = 0. 94 ) as it did on the hold-out force plate test data ( Figure 2E and E; Table 1, and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). A potential benefit of a digital insole relative to a force plate is that many more variables can be derived, thus enabling a more comprehensive assessment of gait

. To further assess generalizability of the model and understand if a digital insole could measure vGRF similarly to a force plate, we applied the model trained using vGRF force plate data to the separate, independent dataset derived from digital insole studies on individuals with knee OA and controls. An important assumption of this analysis was that knee OA and knee injury are represented similarly by vGRF curves as was shown earlier ( Figure 1A–C )

. Compared to control subjects, participants with knee OA are walking more slowly as apparent across all data types, including vGRF ( Figure 4A ), derived gait characteristics ( Figure 4B ), and raw sensor time-series data ( Figure 4C ). We revisited the question of whether gait data can be used to identify arthropathy status relative to control subjects for each of the three types of data collected by the digital insole: vGRF, summary parameters, and time-series data

. Technological development has led to digital insoles ( wearables ) that can capture vGRF and other gait characteristics that are relevant to knee OA assessment, which could be used within free-living environments ( Stern et al., 2022 ). The data generated from digital insoles may allow for phenotyping information to characterize patients with knee OA

. In addition, the finding that our models can identify individual gait patterns suggests that data generated from a digital insole may have unforeseen future applications such as the potential to detect changes in individual gait patterns, which may provide better understanding of the impact of a therapeutic intervention for that individual

The objectives were to characterize data from a wearable insole device ( Moticon ), demonstrate their utility relative to a clinical standard, and investigate optimal analytical methods and data types for the analysis relevant to clinical questions of interest. Three datasets were integrated for analysis ( Figure 1 ). The GaitRec force plate vGRF dataset contained force plate control subjects ( N = 211 ) and knee injury subjects ( N = 625 ) ( Horsak et al., 2020 )

. If we could train models to identify individual subjects from their walk, or from just a single stride, this may suggest that the gait data collected has at a minimum that ability to identify attributes beyond knee disease. We posed this question irrespective of disease state and rather focused on identifying the optimal method to determine an individual participant’s gait pattern. We approached this question via two approaches commonly used in clinical research settings ( Horst et al

., 2022; Godfrey et al., 2018 ). An ML framework may be used as a tool to evaluate the digital gait outcome quality and consistency, as well as how well these data can be used as potential clinical trial endpoints. Selection of the appropriate modeling modalities for a particular clinical question is challenging ( Horst et al., 2019; Slijepcevic et al., 2022 ). The selection of classical ML versus deep learning methods may be influenced by the structure and size of the data

. In addition, full analytical validation of the digital insoles was not possible as force plate and insole data was not collected simultaneously, and therefore evaluation of criterion and concurrent validity was not possible. Future work should help determine gait outcome measures for accuracy and error. This work outlines a framework for an integrated analysis of digital insole data to answer clinical and research questions relevant to digital biomarker development

. Despite this, we were able to show favorable classification performance for these control subjects relative to their force plate counterparts. The study design also did not specifically account for familiarization with the insoles. While this study only looked at knee arthropathies, future work will be focused on a broader set of gait-affecting diseases

. The model indicated strong predictive power to classify control versus knee injury subjects using force plate data when evaluated using fivefold cross-validation of the training/validation dataset, a standard method of assessing model performance ( left knee: area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0. 92 [SD = 0. 03], area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0. 94 [SD = 0. 03]; right knee: auROC = 0. 94 [SD = 0. 02], auPR = 0. 96 [SD = 0. 01] )

., 2021; Horst et al., 2019 ). Recently, there is interest in developing more streamlined ( ‘light-weight’ ) gait algorithms and data processing pipelines using machine learning ( ML ) to automate and process large volumes of novel digital data obtained from wearable devices ( Celik et al., 2022; Godfrey et al., 2018 )

. Additionally, we used walking speed as a single variable predictor of knee OA ( both control subjects and OA patients had been asked to walk at a self-paced comfortable walking speed ). We found that walking speed alone was able to discriminate between knee OA subjects and controls ( auROC = 0. 981, auPR = 0. 983 ). vGRF with the digital insole also demonstrated high predictive power ( LOOCV: auROC = 0. 984, auPR = 0. 990; r5FCV: auROC = 0. 988, auPR = 0. 992 )

. Wearable sensors offer an alternative approach to assessment of gait in those with knee OA ( Mills et al., 2013 ) as they can be deployed within any environment or setting ( Stern et al., 2022 ), are relatively low-cost, and can provide outcomes automatically without the need for highly experienced or trained staff

. To identify disease signatures, we built an ML model using only data from force plates, the clinical standard for gait analysis. The model was trained on force data from participants with knee arthrop and controls and was able to predict force data from a separate, independent insole dataset ( au = 0.83 ; au = 0.86 ). We also showed that a single stride of sensor data can be assigned to a subject, indicating that individuals can be identified by their g characteristics. This work provides a framework for an alternative to traditional gait methods, adds to the body of knowledge regarding wearable analytical pipelines, and supports the development of at-home assessments with the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of monitoring

The study aimed to quantify how well force data can identify disease-specific gait signatures and if a wearable insole can detect similar characteristics. To differentiate controls versus knee arthropies using vF data, we divided the vF force plate dataset into a training set (85 ) and a test set (15 ) and trained a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict classes. We also aimed to clinically validate the measurement of g with insoles in those with knee arthrop through (1) development of a novel framework based on standard force data for within insoles to detect arthrop status (2) processed insole g outcomes and raw signals to identify disease patterns in arthro

We found that the insole SVM trained on force data performed as well as the insole (kneeau = 0.93, au=0.94; kneeau=0.93, au0.94) as did the hold-out force test (Figure 2E; Table 1; Figure—supplement 3). A benefit of insole to force is that many variables can be derived, enabling a comprehensive assessment g. To assess generalizability and if insole can measure vF to force, we applied trained vF data to separate dataset from insole on individuals with OA and controls. An assumption was that OA and knee are represented by vF as shown (Figure 1–C). Compared controls, with OA walking slowly across all types, vF (Figure 4), g (Figure 4), and sensor (Figure 4). revisited whether g can identify arthrop status to subjects each of three types collected by insole vF, parameters, and time data Technological has led insoles that capture v and g relevant to OA, used freeiving (Stern 202). data may allow phenotyping characterize patients OA. addition, finding models identify patterns that data from insole may unforeseen applications detect changes, which provide understanding impact therapeutic for individual

The objectives characterize data from wearable device (Moticon), demonstrate utility to standard, investigate analytical methods and types relevant clinical questions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ), a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

   . Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain. We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain

. Due to the technical challenges and limitations of in vivo optical imaging and recording at nerve terminals in skin, we subsequently used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO. Since HC-HA/PTX3 mimics FLO in its ability to inhibit pain behavior and has higher purity and greater water solubility compared to FLO, it is well-suited for investigating cellular mechanisms

., 2008; Zheng et al., 2022; Figure 2A ). Intra-paw injection of FLO selectively reduced the activation of small-diameter DRG neurons, which are mostly nociceptive neurons, to noxious heat stimulation after plantar-incision ( Figure 2B–D ). We then purified HC-HA/PTX3 from the water-soluble extract of human AM ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B ), and biochemically and functionally characterized it using western blot and TRAP assays ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E; He et al

. These findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD. Additionally, it fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties. CD44 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a cell surface adhesion receptor, regulating essential physiologic and pathologic processes ( Campo et al

. Likewise, applying a neutralizing antibody ( IgG, 10 μg ) to CD44, but not control IgG blocked HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition in WT mice ( Figure 4J ). Collectively, these findings suggest that pain inhibition, as well as the exclusive inhibition of small DRG neurons, which are mostly nociceptive, by HC-HA/PTX3 and FLO, are CD44-dependent. We next explored how HC-HA/PTX3 induces CD44-dependent neuronal inhibition

., 2009 ). HC-HA/PTX3 was suggested to be a biologically active component with uniquely high amounts in human birth tissues ( Chen et al., 2015; He et al., 2009; He et al., 2014 ). However, it remains unclear whether HC-HA/PTX3, as a key component, is responsible for FLO’s inhibitory effects on neuron activation and pain

., 2010; Janiszewska et al., 2010 ). CD44 is the principal receptor for HA ( Ferrari et al., 2018 ). Since HMW-HA is a primary component of the HC-HA/PTX3 complex, we explored whether CD44 is required for the inhibition of post-surgical pain by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. CD44 is expressed in both neurons and glial cells ( Dzwonek and Wilczynski, 2015 ), but its distribution in the DRG was unclear

. In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM

., 2009 ). Applying capsaicin ( a TRPV1 agonist ), cinnamaldehyde ( a TRPA1 agonist ), or β-alanine ( a MrgprD agonist ) to bath solution increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in 41%, 24%, or 17% of DRG neurons ( Domocos et al., 2020; Tiwari et al., 2016 ). Here, HC-HA/PTX3 ( 15 μg/ml ) significantly reduced the [Ca2+]i increase produced by these proalgesics. However, HMW-HA ( 15 μg/ml ) was not effective at the same concentration ( Figure 3C–F )

. In cultured lumbar DRG neurons from WT mice, HC-HA/PTX3 exerted inhibitory effects in both calcium imaging ( Figure 3C–F ) and patch-clamp electrophysiology studies ( Figure 3G, H ). Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1 ), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 ( TRPA1 ), and mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor D ( MrgprD ) -expressing DRG neurons are critical to heat and mechanical pain signaling ( Cavanaugh et al., 2009 )

. Nevertheless, translation of preclinical findings into clinical treatments is complex and often challenging due to species differences and the intricate nature of pain etiology in patients. Our findings provide an important rational for future clinical trials to validate the utility of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 for post-surgical pain control.

. Using in vivo calcium imaging of DRG, we have demonstrated that intra-paw injection of FLO significantly reduced the activation of nociceptive neurons in the ganglia to peripheral noxious stimulation ( Figure 2 ), possibly through inhibiting the transduction of ‘pain’ signals at the peripheral nerve terminals, leading to the alleviation of post-surgical pain ( Figure 1 )

., 2023 ). Importantly, in cultured lumbar DRG neurons from CD44 KO mice, HC-HA/PTX3 did not reduce the capsaicin-evoked increase of [Ca2+]i ( Figure 4C–E ), nor did it alter the IME and the membrane potential ( Figure 4F, G ). The basal IMEs were comparable between WT and CD44 KO mice ( Supplementary file 1 ). Behaviorally, the inhibition of heat hyperalgesia by FLO ( 0. 5 mg, 20 μl ) and by HC-HA/PTX3 ( 10 or 20 μg, 20 μl ) was both diminished in CD44 KO mice ( Figure 4H, I )

. The concentration of FLO we used fell within the range reported in previous clinical studies ( Ackley et al., 2019; Bennett, 2019; Castellanos and Tighe, 2019 ). Since nociceptive neuron hyperexcitability may lead to persistent pain ( Xie et al., 2005; Zimmermann, 2001 ), cellular mechanisms of pain inhibition by FLO can be partly inferred from its modulatory effects on these neurons’ excitability

. Based on our previous findings, which demonstrated that 1 μg of HC-HA/PTX3 contained 1 μg of HMW-HA, 36 ng of HC1, and 10 ng of PTX3 ( He et al., 2013 ), we combined 20 μg of HMW-HA with 720 ng of HC1. However, this mixture did not demonstrate a greater pain-inhibitory effect compared to HMW-HA alone ( Figure 3B ). These findings suggest that the full HC-HA/PTX3 complex is superior to HMW-HA in attenuating post-surgical pain

. F-actin constitutes a subunit of HC-HA/PT3 ( He et al. 2013 ) and PTX 3 is a subunit ( He et al. 2013 ). HC/PT3 is composed of HM-HA, HC, and PTX ( He et al 2013 ). HC/PT3 has been found in human tissues ( He et al 2013 ) and has been shown to be biologically active ( He et al 2013 ). HCPT3 has been shown to induce cytoskeleton rearrangements ( He et al 201 ) and inhibit sodium current ( He et 201 ) and high-voltage activated calcium current ( He 201 ) in nocice DRG neurons

HC/PT3 has been shown to induce cytoskeleton rearrangements ( He et 201 ) and inhibit sodium current ( He 201 ) and high-voltage activated current ( He 201 ) in nocice DRG neurons, suggesting it is a bioactive component mediating pain relief. HC/3 has been found in human tissues ( He 201 ) and has been shown to be biologically active ( He 201 ) HC3 has been shown to induce cytoskeleton rearrangements ( He 201 ) and inhibit sodium current ( 201 ) and high-voltage activated current ( 201 ) inice DR neurons, suggesting it is a bioactive mediating pain relief HC/3 has been found in human ( He 201 ) and has been shown to be biologically ( He 201 ) HC3 has shown to induce cytoskeleton rearrangements ( He 201 ) inhibit sodium (201 ) and high-voltage activated (201 ) current in DR neurons suggesting it is bioactive mediating pain HC3 has been found in human ( He 201 ) has been shown to be biologically ( He 201 ) HC has shown to cytoskeleton rearrangements ( He 201 ) inhibit sodium (201 ) high-voltage (201 ) current in DR suggesting is bioactive mediating pain HC has been found in ( He 201 ) has shown to be biologically ( He 201 ) has cytoskeleton rearrangements (201 ) inhibit sodium ( ) high-voltage ( ) current in DR suggesting bioactive mediating pain has found in ( He 201 ) shown be biologically ( He 201 ) cytoskeleton (201 ) inhibit sodium ( ) high-voltage ( ) current DR suggesting bioactive mediating pain found in ( He 201 be biologically He 201 cytoskeleton ) inhibit ( ) sodium high-voltage ) current DR bioactive mediating pain found ( He 201 biologically  cytoskeleton ) inhibit sodium ) high-voltage DR bioactive mediating pain ( He 201 biologically cytoskeleton inhibit ) sodium high-v DRbio mediating pain ( He 201 cytoskeleton inhibit )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE.

   . In the present study, we utilized this system to monitor the color of iPSC-RPE cells, then to pick up one of the cells, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of that single-cell. In this way, we concluded the color of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profile. We reasoned this by analyzing the correlation between the color and the expression level of each gene

. For this purpose, we re-analyzed the transcriptome of our iPSC-RPE cells shown in Figure 1A. First, we calculated the weighted sum of the RGB channels, the so-called brightness, and used it as a proxy for the pigmentation level. Then, by gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) ( Korotkevich et al

. This suggests the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, and there is a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of the enzymes, and synthesis of melanin ( descriptive image in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Having the results suggesting the color of iPSC-RPE may not be an indicator of the expression levels of RPE markers ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ), next, we sought then which biological aspects underlie the degree of pigmentation of iPSC-RPE cells

. Gene set related to retinoid recycling, an important feature of the RPE to supply the photoreceptor with retinal, showed weak correlation with the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells with correlation coefficients of genes such as RDH11, BCO1, RDH10, DHRS3, and RDH5 at 0. 25, 0. 20, 0. 16, 0. 12, and 0. 11, respectively ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 )

. In fact, there are several lines of evidence implying in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation. For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted ( Sengupta et al., 2009 ), as well as our iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared but actually become heavily pigmented after engrafted ( Mandai et al., 2017; Sugita et al

In this study, we showed the degree of pigmentation of in vitro cultured iPSC-RPE cells did not project specific gene ontological clusters, although it correlated to some extent with the expressions of functional genes of the RPE, such as complement- and lysosome-related genes. Eye, as well as brain and testis, is an immune privilege organ, where inflammation by the immune system is minimized ( Zhou and Caspi, 2010; Chen et al., 2019; Mohan et al., 2022 )

. As no correlation between the color and gene expression profile was revealed in our iPSC-RPE by clustering analysis, next we sought the correlation of individual genes with the color of the cells. When each of the 280, 47 genes was analyzed for the correlation coefficient between its expression level and the color intensity in each cell, even for the gene with the highest positive- or negative-correlation with the color, the coefficient was 0. 565 and –0

. On the other hand, primary culture of fetal-derived RPE cells, although less pigmented initially, becomes heavily pigmented when confluent monolayers are formed ( Maminishkis et al., 2006 ), reflecting the nature of melanosomes produced during a limited time window of embryogenesis ( Boulton, 2014 ). More importantly, human embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) - or iPSC-derived RPE cells exhibit pigmentation when they become confluent ( Boulton, 2014; Kamao et al

. For each of the three RPE cell lineage ( Lonza-RPE, iPS201-RPE, and iPS253-RPE ), we explored biological pathways correlated with pigmentation levels according to the following steps: Finally, for each of the brightness-correlated and -uncorrelated significant pathways, we extracted the intersection, i. e., pathways commonly enriched in all three cell lineages

., 2014 ). Interestingly, the pigmentation level of Lonza-RPE cells correlated with their gene expression profile ( Figure 2D ), which may reflect the developmental process of RPE that gains protective function, including melanogenesis, during embryogenesis. From this aspect, ESC- or iPSC-derived RPE cells may be more plastic, retaining immature profiles although apparently being pigmented spontaneously

. We found the genes that define pigmentation itself had less correlation with the color, suggesting the color in appearance is a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the RPE.

. Because of the strong correlation ( r>0. 99 ) between the three channels ( Figure 1—video 1 ), we used the intensity of the blue channel, or the average intensity of the three channels ( so-called brightness ), as a proxy for the color intensity of each cell. The iPSC-RPE cells photographed and picked by ALPS were then subjected to RNA extraction followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis

. Indeed, it has been shown that in vitro pigmentations of RPE cells are enhanced by extracellular matrix ( Boulton, 2014 ) or even more intriguingly by phagocytosis of rod outer segments ( Schraermeyer et al., 2006 ). Without the exposure to pathogens or photoreceptor outer segments, in vitro pigmentation of iPSC-RPE cells could be somewhat a spontaneous but not a necessary sign to show they are prone to execute their protective function.

. Interestingly, Lonza-RPE showed biased distribution of cell color among the three clusters ( cluster-2, –3, and –7 ), having highly pigmented cells in cluster-2 and –3 but not in –7 ( Figure 2C and D ). These results indicated the degree of pigmentation of our iPSC-RPE did not associate with a specific gene expression profile defined by t-SNE

RPE is a layer of cells paved by hexagonal, brown-pigmented cells, which locates between the neural retina and the choroid

. To characterize the cells with different degrees of pigmentation, 2304 cells of iPSC-RPE ( 96 cells each from two different dishes of 12 independent cultures of iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks; Figure 1—source data 1 ) were photographed under a light microscope ( Figure 1B photos ) and picked as single-cells by ALPS. The intensities of red, green, and blue channels were measured for each cell ( Figure 1B plots ). Because of the strong correlation ( r>0

., 2017; Sugita et al., 2020 ), suggest the significance of environmental niche for melanogenesis. When stem cell-derived RPE cells are cultured in vitro, they are apparently not pigmented at sparse density, probably due to dilution amongst daughter cells ( Boulton, 2014 ) or secretion of melanin by the fusion of melanosome membrane to the plasma membrane as proposed in melanocytes ( Moreiras et al

., 2014 ). Although it was weak, the correlation of complement- and lysosome-related genes to the color shown in the present study, suggests the darker RPE cells may be prone to facilitate these functions. Besides these immunogenic aspects, pigmentation also confers a protective function on RPE from different biological aspects

. To compare the gene expression profiles of our iPSC-RPE lines with other commercially available RPE cells, human fetal primary RPE cells purchased from Lonza were photographed and picked by ALPS after cultured for 6 and 12 weeks as well ( Figure 1—source data 1 )

. RPE cells play an important role in maintaining the visual system by supplying nutrition to the photoreceptors, phagocytosing mature outer segments of the photoreceptors, facilitating visual/retinoid cycle to produce a photosensitive derivative of vitamin A, absorbing stray light for the vision, and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) for the maintenance of choroid blood vessels ( Kim et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2020 ). In this study, we found that the degree of pigmentation of iPSC-R cells did not correlate with the expression of R markers such as RDH11, B1, RD10, DH3, RS, and DH5 ( Figure 4— supplement 3 ), suggesting that the color of iP-R cells may not necessarily indicate the level of maturation of R

The degree of pigmentation of iPSC-R cells did not correlate with the expression of R markers such as RD11, B1,10,3, RS, and DH5 ( Figure 4— supplement 3 ), suggesting the color of iP-R cells may not indicate the level of maturation of R.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ), due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans, has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism.

   . In conclusion, we hope that MarmoAAP and the associated automated cooperative pulling paradigm will make a significant contribution to the study of marmoset social behaviors in the field. The combination of a highly modular and adaptable design, high-resolution behavioral data, and integration with neural recordings positions our paradigm as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior

. Building upon this work, we aimed to develop a task that not only captures the nuances of cooperative behaviors but also allows for high-resolution data collection, making it more suitable for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms in primates. Here, we introduce an innovative method for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets ( C. jacchus ) using an automated apparatus and task

. With a substantially increased number of trials amassed through MarmoAAP, this demonstration supports the possibility of examining the neural dynamics underlying cooperative behaviors in marmosets. Our apparatus and paradigm represent a noteworthy advancement, bridging the gap between traditional animal behavior studies that address ethologically relevant behaviors of animals and precise, highly controlled investigations of neural activity

. By incorporating these behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with the timing of marmosets’ pulling behaviors and reward delivery, one can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in this species using an automated pulling task

. In addition to providing rich behavioral data and offering flexibility for various tasks, MarmoAAP and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP. MarmoAAP significantly increases the number of trials available for analysis and thus ensures ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors

. Complementarily, the inclusion of audio recordings enriches this dataset, allowing for a comprehensive examination of marmosets’ vocal communication patterns and their correlation with task events. This multimodal approach establishes a robust foundation for nuanced investigations into the cognitive processes and social dynamics of marmosets, aligning with a goal toward a comprehensive understanding of primate social behaviors

. The highly reproducible lever-pulling behavior in marmosets within a naturalistic context strikes a crucial balance between conventional laboratory tests, where monkeys are immobilized and tasks lack natural movement but are tightly controlled, and more naturalistic animal behavior studies, where animals exhibit unrestrained behavior but lack regular behavioral benchmarks for studying the underlying neural dynamics ( Fan et al., 2021; Knöll et al., 2018 )

., 2023; Cléry et al., 2021 ). Marmosets provide a unique opportunity to investigate social behavioral dynamics, however, being a relatively new model in the field of neuroscience, they have yet to benefit from the extensive methodological developments available for other model organisms like rodents. Continued innovation in research methods is essential to fully utilize marmosets as a model system to study complex behaviors and their neural correlates

Using MarmoAAP, we were able to elicit consistent and highly repeatable motivated behaviors in freely moving marmoset monkeys. This task design strikes a pivotal balance between traditional naturalistic animal behavior studies, which benefit from a high degree of naturalism but often suffer from low behavioral resolution and limited trial counts, and conventional lab studies, which are highly controlled but lack natural ethological relevance ( Fan et al., 2021 )

. As we move forward, this paradigm not only serves as a platform for in-depth investigations into marmoset social dynamics but also holds the promise of extending our understanding of cognitive processes and neural mechanisms across a variety of complex behaviors

. Recognizing the highly vocal nature of marmosets and their extensive repertoire of vocalizations, each with distinct functions, we also collected audio recordings of every behavioral session. We were able to capture a wide variety of marmoset vocalizations during this task. Here, we specifically focused on chirp, trill, and phee calls ( Figure 2F ). Using the timestamps from the lever pulls and reward delivery, we further analyzed vocalizations relative to task events

. e. m. ) times per 20 min behavioral session demonstrating high levels of motivated behavior ( Figure 2A ). This training phase thus demonstrated the marmosets’ capacity to acquire and consistently execute lever-pulling behavior, providing a dependable means to elicit a high number of motivated and appetitive behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we extended our investigations to more complex tasks requiring cooperative pulling behaviors

. jacchus ) using an automated apparatus and task. Our Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ) for studying cooperative behaviors comprises response levers controlled by a precision servo motor, integrated with a suite of custom-designed components and sensors. Notably, MarmoAAP offers immense versatility, as it can be seamlessly programmed to accommodate a wide spectrum of behavioral tasks

., 2021; Knöll et al., 2018 ). To validate this application of MarmoAAP, we conducted wireless neural recordings using a silicon-based linear array probe while a marmoset engaged in the cooperative pulling task with its partner ( Figure 3A ) and were able to isolate single-unit activity from the prefrontal cortex ( Figure 3B ). On each day, marmosets performed a 10 min session of the Mutual Cooperation task and a 10 min session of the Self-Reward task

., 2005; Crawford, 1937; Martin et al., 2021; Mendres, 2000; Plotnik et al., 2011; Range et al., 2019; Drea and Carter, 2009; Seed et al., 2008; Schmelz et al., 2017 ). While the cooperative pulling paradigm has been invaluable in shedding light on cooperative behaviors across a variety of species, it presents several limitations that hinder its utility for investigating complex behavioral dynamics and preclude studies of underlying neural mechanisms

. Significantly, our study demonstrates that the automated apparatus facilitates a substantial 15-fold increase in the number of trials conducted per session compared to conventional pulling paradigms. This increased trial throughput is of critical importance for investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying these social behaviors, ensuring the acquisition of a robust dataset for comprehensive analyses of neural activity during naturalistic behavioral settings

. Indeed, marmosets consistently show more socio-cognitively advanced behaviors such as social learning, vocal communication, understanding and use of gaze cues, and cooperative problem-solving relative to non-cooperatively breeding primates ( Cronin et al., 2005; Burkart and Heschl, 2007; Hare et al., 2003; Burkart and van Schaik, 2010; Snowdon and Cronin, 2007 )

. In tandem with the intricate behavioral outputs derived from the apparatus, MarmoAAP incorporates the integration of information from many sources and modalities. Utilizing video recordings obtained during the task, we showcased the application of automated behavioral marking tools, such as DLC2 ( Mathis et al., 2018; Nath et al., 2019 ), to probe the interplay between behavioral dynamics—particularly gaze behaviors—and performance on the cooperative task

. Such flexibility is indispensable not only for cooperative tasks but also positions our paradigm as a versatile tool for delving into cognitive processes beyond cooperation. Although this paradigm was developed specifically for marmosets, its adaptable design suggests it could be readily modified for use in other species

. However, investigations of the neurobiology of ecologically valid behaviors can be extremely challenging using traditional approaches. With the rapid advancements in methods for recording and manipulating neural activity from these species, there arises a critical need to modernize our approaches to studying animal behavior to ensure they keep pace with the evolving neural techniques ( Miller et al., 2022; Huk et al., 2018; Scott and Bourne, 2022 )

The study introduces the Marmet Apparatus Automated Pulling (MoAAP), a novel apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmets. Mo addresses the limitations of traditional research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for nuanced analyses in naturalistic settings. The apparatus is flexible, accommodating a wide range of behaviors and animal capabilities, and provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MoAAP bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations, paving the way for research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmets as a model.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of MoAAP and associated cooperative paradigm, capturing nuances of cooperative behaviors and high-resolution data, making it suitable for investigating underlying mechanisms. The apparatus represents a noteworthy advancement, bridging the gap between traditional behavior studies addressing ethologically relevant animals and precise controlled investigations of neural activity. The combination of behavioral metrics from video and audio with timing of mets pulling and reward provides a comprehensive understanding of interplay between behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using automated task.

The Mo and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous recordings while mets are engaged in tasks implemented by Mo, increasing the number of trials for analysis and ensuring statistical power investigating relationship between activity and behaviors. The inclusion of audio enriches the dataset, allowing examination of mets vocal patterns and correlation with events, establishing a robust foundation for investigations into cognitive and social dynamics of mets, aligning with a comprehensive understanding of primate behaviors.

The Mo lever-pulling in mets in naturalistic strikes a balance between conventional tests, where are immobilized and lack movement, and naturalistic studies, exhibit unrestrained but lack benchmarks. Marmets provide a unique opportunity to investigate dynamics, being a relatively new model in neuroscience, they benefit from extensive methodological developments for other organisms. Continued innovation is essential to utilize mets as system study complex behaviors and neural correlates.

The study elicits consistent and repeatable behaviors in moving mets, striking a balance between naturalistic and conventional studies. The paradigm serves as a platform for investigations mets dynamics and holds promise extending understanding cognitive and mechanisms across behaviors. Recognizing the vocal nature and repertoire of mets, audio recordings were collected during sessions, focusing on chirp, trill, and phee calls. Timestamps from pulls and reward analyzed vocalizations relative to events, demonstrating high levels of behavior.

The study validates Mo application, conducting neural recordings using a probe while mets engaged in cooperative task, isolating activity from prefrontal cortex. Each day, mets performed sessions of Mutual and Selfeward tasks. The study demonstrates substantial increase in trials per session compared conventional paradigms, critical for investigations underlying mechanisms, ensuring robust dataset for analyses.
Researchers employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the offspring's genome. Moderate PA was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with potential indicative of broad effects on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects on metastable genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In the murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected some of the damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation. The study demonstrates that early exposure is sufficient to affect fetal regulation even in the absence of phenotypic changes and highlights a role for preventative dietary interventions.

The study identified regions sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing (WGS) was used for unbiased assessment of Cp DNA methylation in brain and liver, two organs affected by ethanol, to explore tissue specificity of effects and determine any tissue-agnostic effects may have arisen prior to germ layers in early gastr. Candidate testing of regions identified as sensitive to early PA was also conducted. The exposure period covered pre-conception until first trimester when neurulation, reflecting typical situation women consume alcohol until pregnancy. The primary outcome was differences in DNA methylation and secondary behavioral deficits across neurodevelopment domains to FAS examined. DNA methylation data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking About in Pregnancy (A) cohort were available, with 96 PA and 51 controls. Differential testing of 189 Cp sites corresponded to DMRs, comparing exposed to found no evidence differential methylation.

In the model, effects were predominantly tissue-specific, with two regions and genes similarly affected both liver and brain. Perturbations may established stochastically PA to early embryo and maintained differentiating. Analysis in germ tissues required formally establish. To investigate effects early PA and diet on methylation outcomes, a murine model with four groups was employed. Treatment groups assessed effect on methylation compared to control, additional included maternal high donors without exposure. The study demonstrates early PA can disturb genome in mice and humans, supporting public advice consumption during pregnancy, even low, may be harmful.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

   . Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( reviewed in Seroussi et al., 2022 ) makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A skeletal pathway that is required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans ( Figure 1A )

. The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing

. The fact that any two of MUT-16, NRDE-3, and RDE-10 – three structurally and functionally different proteins – are required for unc-22 silencing suggests that each of these proteins could be contributing to silencing of any RNAi target

. Similar mechanisms could be used to generate other 22G RNAs that are independent of RDE-10 ( Yang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Future studies are needed to test each aspect of the model. RNAi is now a widely applied tool for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans. Like C. elegans, plants ( Sanan-Mishra et al., 2021 ) and some insects ( Pinzón et al

. These observations hint at the influence of gene-specific factors on the functional outcome of RNAi and impel the exploration of a more detailed dynamic model. A qualitative outline of the molecular mechanism for RNAi in C. elegans has been deduced based on a variety of studies over the last two decades ( mechanism outline; Figure 4A, left ), but the cellular, subcellular, and kinetic details of every step remain obscure

. elegans. Of these, 22G RNAs ( 2° siRNAs ) are the most abundant and arise from amplification downstream of exposure to dsRNA and in multiple endogenous small RNA pathways ( Gu et al., 2009 ). Our results suggest that production of 2° siRNAs in response to dsRNA is eliminated in animals that lack both MUT-16 and RDE-10 ( Figure 3C ). While the precise mechanisms of amplification are unknown, MUT-16 is thought to nucleate perinuclear foci in the germline ( Phillips et al

. The stark differences in the extents of silencing bli-1 ( ~0% ) versus unc-22 ( ~100% ) ( Figures 1D and 2B ) in animals lacking MUT-16, RDE-10, or NRDE-3 suggest that there could be target-specific pathways for silencing, tissue-specific differences in the expressions of RNA regulators, or more parsimoniously, that each regulator contributes to the silencing of both targets as part of an intersecting network, through transcriptional gene silencing and/or post-transcriptional gene

. In contrast, since the mRNA is used as a template to generate the abundant secondary small RNAs in C. elegans ( Pak et al., 2012 ) or additional dsRNAs in other systems ( e. g., in plants; Sanan-Mishra et al., 2021 ), the silencing of different mRNAs could diverge through the selective recruitment of different collections of regulators

. This branching of the RNAi pathway downstream of RDE-1 could result in strictly parallel pathways where MUT-16 and RDE-10 are used to silence different sets of genes ( Figure 1E, left ) or in an intersecting network where both regulators contribute to the silencing of all genes ( Figure 1E, right ). Additional observations suggest differences in the requirements for silencing bli-1 and unc-22

. Furthermore, loss of eri-1 was not sufficient for the complete rescue of unc-22 silencing in animals lacking any two of these three regulators ( Figure 3C ). An alternative approach for increasing dsRNA processing is the overexpression of the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, which recruits dsRNA for processing by DCR-1 ( Tabara et al., 2002, Parker et al., 2006 )

. We show that MUT-16, RDE-10, and NRDE-3 are each required for the silencing of bli-1, but any two of these proteins are sufficient for unc-22 silencing. These differences can be explained by differences in the thresholds for silencing the two genes using an intersecting network of regulators but not by parallel pathways of regulation after primary mRNA recognition

. Taken together, these results suggest that gene-specific requirements for some proteins that function in RNAi do not reflect different pathways for silencing different genes, but rather a quantitative requirement for regulators acting as part of an intersecting RNA regulatory network. The many protein regulators of RNAi drive changes in RNA metabolism, including the production of new RNA species ( 1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA ), that are associated with the targeted gene

. For such an intersecting network with quantitative contributions by multiple regulators of RNAi to explain the silencing of somatic targets, including targets like unc-22 and bli-1 that show dramatic differences, it should be possible to identify values for the relative contributions of each regulatory path ( Nm = from MUT-16 to NRDE-3, Nr = from RDE-10 to NRDE-3, Om = from MUT-16 to other Argonautes, and Or = from RDE-10 to other Argonautes in Figure 2C, left ) and for gene-specific

. elegans ( Figure 1A ). Long dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1 ( Feinberg and Hunter, 2003; Winston et al., 2002 ), after which it is bound by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 ( Tabara et al., 2002 ), which recruits the endonuclease DCR-1 ( Knight and Bass, 2001 ) to cleave the long dsRNA into smaller dsRNAs ( Parker et al., 2006 ). The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 ( Parrish and Fire, 2001; Tabara et al

. g., loss of both MUT-16 and RDE-10 in Figure 2B ) or when the increase in dsRNA processing is insufficient. To test these predictions, we increased dsRNA processing and examined silencing in animals lacking different regulators required for the silencing of bli-1 and/or unc-22. One approach for increasing dsRNA processing is the release of factors such as the endonuclease DCR-1 from competing endogenous pathways by removing the exonuclease ERI-1 ( Lee et al., 2006 )

. For any gene, the time to knockdown ( τkd ) and the duration of knockdown ( tkd ) could be used to evaluate the efficiency of RNAi ( knockdown = 10% of initial mRNA concentration in Figure 4C ). The different RNA species made downstream of 1° RNA binding in C. elegans provide the opportunity for multiple parameters to differ between genes. Therefore, we varied each parameter and examined τkd and tkd as indicators of efficiency ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )

. For example, the subcellular localization of mRNA could increase or decrease its interaction with RdRPs and thus influence the levels of 2° siRNAs made. Future studies that address the dynamics and subcellular localization of target mRNA before RNAi and the subcellular localization of components of the RNAi machinery are required to test these hypotheses. Multiple small RNA species of defined lengths and 5′-nt bias have been detected in C. elegans

. However, loss of both MUT-16 and R-10 ( Figure 3B ) or the increase in dsRNA processing ( Figure 3C ) did not rescue the silencing of unc-22 in animals lacking NR-3, suggesting that NR-3 is required for the silencing of unc-22 but not bli-1.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common, primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes.

   . Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals, there were differences: death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults, and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults. We also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status

. We then performed variable selection using a multivariate elastic-net Cox regression model to select the important predictors for HIV-negative and HIV-positive TBM prognosis separately. Candidate predictors in HIV-negative TBM consisted of the combination of common hub genes, HIV-negative specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers: age, TBM severity and CSF lymphocyte count

. We aimed to identify baseline gene signatures that might help predict death or survival from TBM. We selected potential gene predictors from 26 common and 10 HIV-specific hub genes; these hub genes represented the dominant modules associated with mortality. Three predefined clinical factors known to be associated with outcome ( age, MRC grade and CSF lymphocyte count ) were also used for candidate predictor selection

. This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level in whole blood, characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death. We sought to understand better the pathogenesis of TBM by identifying pretreatment blood transcriptional gene modules associated TBM disease severity and three-month mortality

. Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality stratified by HIV status are shown in Figure 3. In HIV-negative individuals, 786 ( 3. 9% ) genes were differentially expressed, whereas in HIV-positive the number was 1620 ( 8. 1% ) genes ( Figure 3B–C; Supplementary file 1G and H ). We hypothesized that host transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality differ according to HIV status

. A range of immune responses, involving in inflammation, cytokines, interferon, inflammasome and neutrophil signaling pathways, were activated in both PTB and TBM, but with significantly greater activation in HIV-positive TBM than HIV-negative TBM. This finding aligns with our previous data showing a dysregulated hyper-inflammation in HIV-associated TBM, with significantly higher CSF cytokine concentrations than in those without HIV infection ( Thuong et al., 2017 )

. Using a multivariate Cox elastic-net regression model for 39 predictors, six predictors were selected for HIV-negative TBM ( MRC grade, age, CSF lymphocyte count, gene set 1: MCEMP1, TRABD2A, and CD4 ), and six predictors were selected for HIV-positive TBM ( MRC grade, age, CSF lymphocyte count, gene set 2: NELL2, MCEMP1, and ZNF354C; Supplementary file 1L )

. 8/11 hub genes were found to be significantly associated with mortality, as determined univariate Cox regression ( Table 3 ). Three genes ( FCAR, PGD, ETS2 ) also found to be associated but in reverse direction. We, next, examined patterns of shared and distinct gene expression of some hub across the four cohorts ( healthy controls, PTB, and TBM with and without HIV-infection ) to reveal disease progression and pathogenesis of different TB forms ( Figure 6 )

. Ten hub genes associated with mortality ( CD96, TNFRSF25, TBC1D4, CD28, ABLIM1, RASGRP1, NELL2, TRAF5, TESPA1, TRABD2A ) were from the brown module, three ( EVL, PLCG1, NLRC3 ) from the red, and six ( CD2, CD247, TGFBR3, ARL4C, KLRK1, MATK ) from the black module ( Figure 5E–H ). For qPCR validation, available samples from HIV-negative TBM patients ( n=132 ) were used to evaluate 11 hub genes selected from the blue and brown modules

. In real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) validation cohort, 132 HIV-negative TBM adults have similar characteristics as HIV-negative TBM RNA-seq cohort ( Table 1 ). The clinical variables associated with three-month mortality of the 281 adults with TBM in RNA-seq cohort are given in Table 2. The discovery ( n=142 ) and validation ( n=139 ) cohorts had similar characteristics ( Table 2 ). 47. 3% ( 133/281 ) had definite TBM ( Marais et al

. Our objective was to use weighted gene co-expression network analysis, an unbiased and well-evaluated approach, to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and assess the predictive value of gene expression for early mortality from TBM.

. We identified a four-gene set at the start of treatment ( MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4 ) whose expression strongly predicted three-month TBM mortality. Our prognostic models combining this four-gene host response in blood and two routine clinical predictors achieved very good performance, with AUC 0. 80 and 0. 86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals with TBM, respectively

. TBM mortality was associated with increased acute inflammatory responses, the regulation of inflammatory responses, and neutrophil activation. Previous blood transcriptome studies have shown that IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven transcripts were over-expressed in blood neutrophils from active TB patients compared to those with latent TB ( Berry et al., 2010; Singhania et al., 2018 )

. In TBM, enrichment of genes in these pathways were generally higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative individuals. Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality were generated by identifying differentially expressed genes. Of the top 20, 000 genes with most variation, we observed 724 ( 3. 6% ) genes that were differentially expressed ( FDR <0. 05, absolute fold change ( FC ) >1. 5 ) in all those with TBM ( Figure 3A )

. The objectives and cohorts used in this study are presented in Figure 1 and a workflow of data analysis is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Briefly, blood transcriptional profiling was generated from four cohorts of 207 TBM HIV-negative, 74 TBM HIV-positive, 279 PTB and 30 healthy controls. To define transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality, data from all 281 TBM participants were used

. Similarly, for HIV-positive TBM, candidate predictors consisted of common hub genes, HIV-positive specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers. We performed the analysis with 1, 000 bootstrap sampling with replacement. The chosen variables were ( 1 ) among the top 75% of selected variables and ( 2 ) one representative hub gene per module

. Of the five modules associated with death from TBM, all were correlated with MRC grade ( Figure 4A ). Four of these five modules, were enriched for immune responses. We next identified hub genes within the four biologically functional modules associated with TBM mortality in both the discovery and validation cohorts

. The enrichment scores indicated mortality was strongly associated with downregulation of adaptive immune responses, including T cell activation, T and B cell receptor signaling pathways, with little impact of HIV status on these pathways ( Figure 9 ). These data suggest an inadequate adaptive immune response contributes to disease pathogenesis and mortality in all those with TBM, regardless of HIV status

. However, pathway enrichment scores were higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative, especially for the TNF signaling pathway and TNF transcripts ( Figure 9 ). Death in HIV-negative TBM was associated with increased enrichment of these pathways, but with less TNF transcript compared to HIV-positive individuals

. Hierarchical clustering of modules indicated that these two modules were highly correlated ( Figure 8A ) suggesting they share similar biological functions. We identified four genes associated with mortality in HIV-negative TBM ( MRC, age, CSF lymphocyte, MMP, TRD2, and CD ) and six in HIV-positive TBM ( MRC, age, CS lymphocyte, N2, M1, Z354, and CD ) using multivariate elastic-net regression.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines ( Laflamme et al., 2019 ) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, have demonstrated that: ( i ) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, ( ii ) yet, ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.

   . We sought to address this issue by developing optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in the three most common uses of antibodies in biomedical research laboratories; Western blot ( WB ), immunoprecipitation ( IP ), and immunofluorescence ( IF ). We used these protocols to test antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets, chosen by funders, to predict requirements for the larger goal of coverage of an entire mammalian proteome

. Our studies provide an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for the representation and comparison of antibody performance, an estimate of the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, an assessment of the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods, and they inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins

. We have tested 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 proteins, and found that approximately two thirds of this protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant

Here, we present the analysis of a dataset of commercial antibodies as an assessment of the problem of antibody performance, and as a step toward a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem to validate commercial antibodies. We evaluated 614 antibodies against 65 human proteins side-by-side in WB, IP, and IF. All raw data are openly available ( https://ZENODO. org/communities/ycharos/ ), identifiable on the RRID portal and on participating antibody manufacturers’ websites

Antibodies are critical reagents used in a range of applications, enabling the identification, quantification, and localization of proteins studied in biomedical and clinical research. The research enterprise spends significantly on the ~1. 6 M commercially available antibodies targeting ~96% of human proteins ( Bandrowski et al., 2023 )

. Although we observed that there are more commercial antibodies available for the best-studied proteins ( Figure 1—source data 1 ), an encouraging result of our work is that more than half of our protein targets are covered by well-performing, renewable antibodies for WB, IP and IF - including both well characterized and more poorly studied proteins

., 2019; Virk et al., 2019 ). Academic and industry scientists aspire to have at least one, and ideally more, potent, selective and renewable antibody for each human protein for each of the most common applications ( Marx, 2020 ). Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon mechanism to determine, validate or compare antibody performance and there are multiple strategies for antibody validation ( Uhlen et al., 2016 ), with unequal scientific value

., 2020; Baker, 2020 ). With tens to hundreds of antibodies available for any given protein target, it is difficult for antibody users to select the best performing antibody ( Voskuil, 2014 ), and a growing number of cases reveal that depending on previously published antibodies is not a reliable method to assess their performance ( Laflamme et al., 2019; Sato et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Sicherre et al., 2021; Haytural et al., 2019; Virk et al., 2019 )

., 2020; Sato et al., 2021; Aponte Santiago et al., 2023; Freedman et al., 2016 ) ; our analyses provide insight into the magnitude of the problem. In our set of 65 proteins, we found that an average of ~12 papers per protein included use of an antibody that failed to recognize the intended protein target using our protocols. Scientists are not entirely to blame; dozens of antibodies can be used in a single study, often unrelated to the authors’ protein of interest

. Our approach, developed in collaboration with manufacturers, and intended to be applied to entire proteomes, uses universal protocols for all tested antibodies in each application. Scientists use variants of such protocols, optimized for their protein of interest, which can have a major impact on antibody performance ( Pillai-Kastoori et al., 2020; Piña et al., 2022; Marcon et al., 2015 )

., 2016 ), with unequal scientific value. Most information on how commercial antibodies perform is anecdotal. It is thus difficult to assess progress toward the objective of well-validated antibodies for each human protein, or to design a strategy to accomplish this aim

. For IP, 105 publications employed 41 of our tested antibodies while 65% of these used a well-performing antibody but 35% employed an antibody unable to immunocapture its target protein ( Figure 4C ). For IF, we found 548 publications that employed 80 of the antibodies we tested. Of these publications, 22% used an antibody unable to immunolocalize its target protein ( Figure 4C ), with 88% containing no validation data ( Figure 4D )

. Only 39% of the antibodies recommended for IF were successful ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1, right bar graph ). We next investigated if antibody validation strategies have equal scientific value. Broadly, antibodies are characterized using genetic approaches, which exploit KO or knockdown ( KD ) samples as controls, or using orthogonal approaches, which rely on known information about the target protein of interest as a correlate to validate performance

. We received on average 9. 5 antibodies per protein target contributed from an average of five different antibody manufacturers ( Figure 1E, F and G ). Companies often contributed more than one antibody per target ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). For WB, antibodies were tested on cell lysates for intracellular proteins or cell media for secreted proteins ( Figure 1E )

. For IP, trends were similar: 39%, 32% and 54% of polyclonal, monoclonal and recombinants, respectively ( Figure 3, middle bar graph ). For IF, we tested 529 antibodies against the set of intracellular proteins; 22% of polyclonal antibodies, 31% of monoclonal antibodies, and 48% of recombinant antibodies generated selective fluorescence signals in images of parental versus KO cells ( Figure 3, right bar graph )

. We estimate a cost of $50 million USD to characterize antibodies against all proteins in a proteome, considering parallelization and industrialization of the procedure. The costs mentioned exclude the expenses of antibodies and knockout cell lines. However, it should be noted that this estimated cost for validation is far below the predicted waste on bad antibodies, currently estimated at ~$1B/year ( Voskuil et al., 2020 )

. To begin the process of large-scale antibody validation and to provide a large enough dataset to allow for more accurate estimates of the work and financing required to complete such a project, we began with the human proteome. We created a partnership of academics, funders, and commercial antibody manufacturers, including 10 companies representing approximately 27% of antibody manufacturing worldwide

. Thus, recombinant antibodies are on average better performers than polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies in each of the applications. It should be noted that recombinant antibodies are newer protein reagents compared to polyclonal and monoclonal hybridomas, and their superior performance could be a consequence of enhanced internal characterization by the commercial suppliers. Our analyses also inform the characterization pipelines to use for newly generated renewable antibodies

. While leading companies are increasingly assessing antibody performance, it is exceedingly difficult, and cost restrained, to properly characterize all their products. Even when available, high-performing antibodies may remain hidden within the millions of reagents of unknown quality

. Throughout the manuscript, renewable antibodies refer to monoclonal antibodies from hybridomas and to recombinant antibodies ( monoclonal and polyclonal recombinant antibodies ) generated in vitro. For Figure 2A, the analysis of 614 antibodies against 65 proteins, we found that ~50% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and ~75% by at least one-per antibody depending on the application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant

Our study demonstrates the scale of the specificity problem of commercial antibodies but also suggests an efficient strategy toward coverage of the human proteome using the existing antibody repertoire and the data to focus new renewable generation efforts.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome, FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Finally, using new compatible shRNA vectors, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. Together, these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

   . Following successful integration into the fly genome, the vector generates a driver in which a target gene expresses both QF2 and LexA-GAD. If desired, one of the two coding regions can then be excised with Flp, resulting in flies that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, we evaluated both QF2 and LexA-GAD systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a compatible library of transgenic shRNA lines in our custom QUAS and LexAop vectors as a community resource

., 2022 ), a company synthesizes and clones a plasmid that contains all of the necessary features for CRISPR HDR plus a cloning site to allow ligation of T2A-LexA-GAD, T2A-QF, or T2A-LexA-GAD-T2A-QF fragments in a single step to produce the donor plasmid. For our targets, we selected a set of genes with tissue-specific expression patterns encompassing most of the major organs of the fly ( Table 1 )

. The vast majority of these are to induce expression of fluorescent reporter genes, rather than molecular genetic reagents such as shRNAs for RNAi. This lack of fly stock reagents dramatically slows down studies that require two independent binary transcriptional systems, as custom fly stock reagents must be made by individual groups. Several methods have been developed to generate new drivers with well-established tissue-specific patterns

. When possible, we selected genes which had a previously characterized GAL4 insertion, and strong evidence of tissue specificity ( e. g. from publicly available scRNAseq, in situ, and immunohistochemistry ). Once the donors/guides were cloned, they were injected into Cas9-expressing fly embryos to induce CRISPR-based HDR of the T2A-LexA-GAD or T2A-QF2 ( Figure 1D and E )

., 2021; Wendler et al., 2022 ). In summary, we have generated a set of stocks, vectors, and protocols that when combined with the wide array of GAL4 lines will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously.

. For combined expression of LexA-GAD and QF2 transcription factors, we built two different vectors: ( 1 ) a CRISPR donor version, which we used to insert the LexA-GAD-QF2 cassette into an endogenous locus of interest, such that the expression of lexA-GAD and QF2 is driven by endogenous regulatory sequences, and ( 2 ) a ϕC31-attB version, which is used to clone an enhancer fragment of interest and integrated into an attP site in the fly genome

. Further, we expect that there will also be differences between the expression pattern of corresponding GAL4 and the LexA-GAD/QF lines, as the latter were made by knock-in, while the former are often enhancer traps. However, based on our larval mounts and dissections, the stocks generated in this paper are highly specific to the expression pattern of the targeted genes. Importantly, our knock-in constructs contain the 3XP3-RFP cassette for screening transformants

. For this combined expression of LexA-GAD and QF2 transcription factors, we built two types of vectors: ( 1 ) a CRISPR donor version, pHDR-T2A-QF2-T2A-LexA-GAD-3xP3-RFP, which is used to insert the cassette into an endogenous locus of interest ( Figure 4A ), and ( 2 ) a phiC31-attB version, pMCS-T2A-QF2-T2A-LexA-GAD-WALIUM20, which is used to clone an enhancer fragment of interest and is then integrated into an attP site in the fly’s genome ( Figure 4B )

. There remains an unmet need for a single vector that would allow for UAS/LexAop/QUAS control of different shRNAs. However, recent innovations in multi-module vectors and multiplexed drug-based genetics allow researchers to more efficiently generate UAS/QUAS/lexAop transgenic fly strains ( Matinyan et al., 2021; Wendler et al., 2022 )

. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we targeted 23 genes to produce 44 new highly tissue-specific LexA-GAD and QF2 driver lines by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair. We chose to use LexA with the GAL4 activation domain, rather than the p65 or VP16 activation domains to allow for temporal control by the temperature-sensitive GAL4 repressor, GAL80 ( Lai and Lee, 2006; Pfeiffer et al., 2010 )

Most reagents available for loss-of-function ( LOF ) and gain-of-function studies using RNAi or CRISPR rely on GAL4/UAS-mediated expression ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Dietzl et al., 2007; Perkins et al., 2015; Zirin et al., 2020; Port and Boutros, 2022 ). However, some studies, such as the study of intercellular or inter-organ communication, require the simultaneous use of two independent binary transcriptional systems

., 2022 ), and the T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 knock-ins in these genes were indeed restricted to this tissue. Our collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 and double driver vectors can be easily adapted to target any gene for CRISPR knock-in, with a high probability that the resulting line will accurately reflect the expression of the endogenous locus

We made each genetic driver line by inserting T2A-LexA-GAD or T2A-QF2 in the coding sequence of a target gene. We have previously reported the CRISPaint method to insert T2A-GAL4 into any gene using homology-independent repair ( Bosch et al., 2020 ). Using this method, we showed robust gene-specific integration of donor plasmids in the fly germ line and successfully generated new driver lines

. Together, these QF2/LexA-GAD and QUAS/LexAop vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

. Thus, we can systematically compare LexA-GAD vs QF2 activators inserted at precisely the same position in the genome. In addition to the new fly stocks, we provide a new set of vectors and protocols to efficiently generate LexA-GAD and/or QF2 drivers. This includes constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, with each coding sequence flanked by FRT sites

. However, because of the high probability of indels at the insertion site, we opted to use traditional CRISPR homology-directed repair to insert the T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 into the genome. We first modified the CRISPaint donor vectors to produce pHDR-T2A-LexA-GAD-Hsp70-3xP3-RFP and pHDR-T2A-QF2-Hsp70-3xP3-RFP, which contain the transcriptional activators followed by Hsp70 terminators

. Our protocol for generating these stocks is straightforward and can be easily adapted to produce driver lines for other fly tissues. These efforts will benefit from the emergence of scRNAseq datasets, which can be used to identify target genes with highly organ or tissue-specific gene expression patterns. For example, we identified the uncharacterized genes CG9458 and CG17560, as highly oenocyte-specific based on the Fly Cell Atlas Single-cell transcriptome ( Li et al

., 2019 ). Despite these techniques, and the growing collection of LexA-GAD and QF2 lines, progress has been slow, and the choice of tissues to target has been limited by the availability of fly reagents, such as shRNAs for RNAi. This lack of fly reagents slows studies that require two binary transcriptional systems, as custom reagents must be made by individual groups. We selected genes with characterized GAL4 insertion and evidence of tissue specificity ( e. g. from publicly available scRNA, in situ, and immunohistochemistry. Once donors were cloned, they were injected into Cas-expressing embryos to induce CRPR HDR of T2-LAex-G or T2-Q2 ( Figure 1 and E )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

    There is emerging evidence that the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental as well as neuropsychiatric disorders that are frequently associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work from our group demonstrated Bcl11b to be essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. The underlying molecular mechanisms downstream of Bcl11b, however, remained elusive

., 2020 ). We have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal learning and memory ( Simon et al., 2016; Simon et al., 2012 ). In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses ( MFS ), the connections between DGN and CA3 pyramidal neurons ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 )

. Taken together, this study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of MFS function. Recent genetic studies suggested its single components to be associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate these molecules to be interconnected in one regulatory pathway

. We have previously shown that conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of MFS characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, misdistribution of SV as well as loss of MF-LTP ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). Here, we found that reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant DGN ( De Bruyckere et al

., 2022 ). Our study for the first time identifies a Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-dependent signaling pathway in the control of basic structural and functional properties of MFS. Analysis of this regulatory pathway in mice may provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders

. Importantly, SV trafficking and altered release probability have been implicated in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders ( Egbujo et al., 2016; Lepeta et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2021 ). Thus, the identification of the Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling module in this study provides a new entry point for future mechanistic analyses of synaptopathies

. Moreover, the existence of such cell-type-specific signaling modules reveals how a fundamental transcription factor with diverse functions such as Bcl11b can be implicated in the pathogenesis of brain disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction.

., 2018 ). The molecular mechanisms, however, through which the transcriptional regulator Bcl11b controls highly dynamic properties of the MFS remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the secreted synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2, a member of the C1q-like protein family ( Yuzaki, 2017 ), is a functional target of Bcl11b in murine DGN

. The ultrastructural changes at the MFS point towards potential alterations in synaptic function. Indeed, adult-induced Bcl11b cKO was previously found to result in a loss of MF-LTP ( De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). We therefore tested whether the reintroduction of C1ql2 in Bcl11b cKO DGN can rescue LTP at the mutant MFS, similarly to SV recruitment. We stimulated mossy fibers in acute slices and measured the resulting field potentials in the SL of CA3

. This function was specific to C1ql2 since overexpression of C1ql3 in Bcl11b mutant DGN was unable to rescue the synapse phenotype. Furthermore, another study has identified all four C1ql proteins, including C1ql2, as ligands for the postsynaptic Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 ( BAI3 ). Addition of any of the four C1ql proteins to cultured hippocampal neurons led to a loss of excitatory synapses, a function inhibited by the presence of BAI3 ( Bolliger et al., 2011 )

. 30±1. 67, Bcl11b cKO +EGFP: 35. 18±1. 13, Bcl11b cKO +EGFP-2A-C1ql2: 36. 35±1. 01, Bcl11b cKO +EGFP-2A-C1ql3: 36. 65±0. 1, mean ± SEM ). Thus, our data suggest that C1ql2 specifically controls SV recruitment downstream of Bcl11b. Conditional deletion of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus also leads to a loss of MFS, as well as reduced ultrastructural complexity of the remaining mossy fiber boutons ( MFB; De Bruyckere et al

. It might be that synapses that are preferentially eliminated in Bcl11b mutants are predominantly silent or have weak coupling strength, such that their loss has only a minimal effect on synaptic transmission. Further investigation is needed to elucidate this apparent discrepancy. Together, our results suggest Bcl11b to be an important synaptic regulator that controls the structure and function of adult MFS through both C1ql2-dependent, as well as -independent transcriptional programs

. 2±6. 88;+Cre: 188. 44±11. 43, mean ± SEM; Vesicle diameter:+inactive Cre: 38. 38±0. 44;+Cre: 37. 12±0. 8, mean ± SEM ). Thus, our results provide evidence that Bcl11b controls MFS organization through C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling, explicating how Bcl11b, a transcription factor with a broad range of functions, can regulate highly specific processes in the brain.

. C1ql proteins are complement-related factors that are synthesized by the presynapse and secreted into the synaptic cleft. Within the hippocampus, C1ql2 and –3 protein expression overlaps and is highly restricted to DGN ( Iijima et al., 2010 ) and the corresponding mossy fiber system, including MF-CA3 synapses. C1ql2 and –3 were previously suggested to form functional heteromers that can cluster postsynaptic KAR on MFS

. Interestingly, recent studies have also associated C1QL2 with schizophrenia ( Marballi et al., 2022 ) as well as cocaine addiction ( Huggett and Stallings, 2020b ). In this study we demonstrate that Bcl11b, through its transcriptional target C1ql2, modulates the synaptic organization of MFS by controlling the recruitment of SV at AZ. This regulatory mechanism depends on a direct interaction of C1ql2 with Nrxn3 ( 25b+ )

. 45±0. 14, mean ± SEM ). Thus, KD of C1ql2 in WT DGN recapitulates major phenotypes observed upon Bcl11b cKO, supporting that Bcl11b controls SV recruitment and LTP in hippocampal MFS specifically through C1ql2. C1ql2 was previously shown to interact with a particular splice variant of Nrxn3β containing exon 25b sequences, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ), which was recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells ( Matsuda et al., 2016 )

. 95±0. 09, Bcl11b cKO +EGFP: 2. 02±0. 14,clb11 c +EGFP-2-Cql: 1.01 0. ,clb c +EG-Cql3: .01 0., mean ± SEM ). Our data indicate that Cql regulates SV and LTP at MFS through interaction with Nrx3 ( 25+ ). The interaction between Cql and Nn3 ( 25+ ) was disrupted by expression of a non-binding Cql mutant or deletion of Nn3 in DGN recapitulated the B11 as well as Cql mutant phenotypes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ), probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined.

   . Sfp1 impacts the mRNA life cycle - from transcription to degradation. Interestingly, the Sfp1 effect on transcription elongation is linked to its function on mRNA stabilization, suggesting that all its functions are connected. Sfp1 possesses two classical zinc fingers

., 2019, and our unpublished NET-seq data ). An important support for this notion is the correlation we found between the binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies and Pol II occupancy in all genes ( Figure 5B ). The general capacity of Sfp1 to alter elongating Pol II in the context of Rpb4 and to affect backtracking ( Figure 7B, Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) likely underlies its widespread effect on transcription

. This alteration in the Pol II configuration is reflected in the increased backtracking frequency, as indicated by the BI values. Moreover, the binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies correlates with Pol II activity, particularly within CRAC + genes ( Figure 5B ). Thus, Sfp1’s function in a subset of its target genes extends beyond transcription initiation and encompasses transcription elongation, as we proposed earlier ( Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012b )

. 423 ). This indicates that the interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin has an effect on both Pol II elongation and mRNA HLs, suggesting a mechanistic linkage. The yeast Rpb4 is a sub-stoichiometric Pol II subunit ( Choder, 2004; Choder and Young, 1993 ), which enhances Pol II polymerization activity ( Fischer et al., 2020; Rosenheck and Choder, 1998 ) and promotes mRNA instability due to co-transcriptional imprinting ( Goler-Baron et al., 2008; Lotan et al., 2007; Lotan et al

. Taking all these observations together, it appears that backtracking is associated with co-transcriptional binding of Sfp1 to nascent RNA. Reassuringly, RiBi genes that exhibit Sfp1-dependent backtracking also imprint Sfp1, whereas those that do not also do not imprint ( Figure 6B, ‘RiBi CRAC+, ’ and ‘RiBi non-CRAC+’ ). Unexpectedly, in addition to its chromatin binding feature, we find that Sfp1 binds a subpopulation of mRNAs whose transcription is stimulated by Sfp1 – ‘CRAC +mRNAs

. Taken together, these results are consistent with the possibility that recruitment of Sfp1 to its cognate promoters, mediated by Rap1, is necessary for its capacity to co-transcriptionally interact with the transcript. The interaction of Sfp1 with mRNA and with Rpb4, as well as its localization to P-bodies, suggests that Sfp1 plays a role in mRNA decay

. ( II ) ChIP-exo results, dependent on Sfp1’s cross-linking with DNA, indicate Sfp1’s presence near DNA, both at promoters and gene bodies ( Figure 5A ). ( III ) Sfp1 influences Pol II configuration in a manner that impacts the architecture or stoichiometry of Rpb4 within Pol II ( Figure 7 ). ( IV ) Sfp1 binding to chromatin better correlates with all Pol II ( both backtracked and active ) than with transcriptionally active Pol II, examined by BioGRO-seq ( Figure 5B )

. Sfp1 possesses two classical zinc fingers. Given that proteins with zinc fingers, characteristic of many TFs, are known to be involved in DNA, RNA, and protein binding, it is conceivable that this zinc finger-containing protein is suitable for participating in the mRNA imprinting process, as proposed here ( Figure 8B ). Given that RBPs have been proposed to perform multiple roles in RNA-based regulation of gene expression in mammals ( Xiao et al

. Perhaps, promoter binding of Sfp1 via Rap1 is necessary and sufficient for its RNA binding. Sfp1 is a well-known transcription factor that binds to promoters of its cognate genes ( see Introduction ). Our discovery that Sfp1 also binds to CRAC + mRNAs, which are only encoded by a fraction of the Sfp1 target genes ( see previous sections ), prompted us to investigate whether the chromatin binding feature of Sfp1 with CRAC + genes is different from its binding with other gene targets

. Taken together, we propose that the effects of Sfp1 on mRNA stability and on Pol II elongation are linked. Our results are compatible with a model whereby Sfp1 impact on Rpb4 during elongation provokes mRNA imprinting, which affects stability, and concomitantly produces Pol II backtracking.

., 2019 ), we suspect that the weak binding of Sfp1 to the bodies of these genes is also through Pol II interaction. Albert et al., 2019 discovered that the complete set of ~500 gene promoters bound by Sfp1 could be revealed only by a combination of ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq ( ‘chromatin endogenous cleavage, ’ using micrococcal nuclease [MNase] fused to Sfp1 ) methods. These two methods revealed the two distinct promoter binding modes of Sfp1, discussed earlier

. g. Churchman and Weissman, 2011 ). Consistent with co-transcriptional binding, Sfp1 binds intron-containing RPL30 RNA ( Figure 2D; note that the ratio between intron-containing RNA and mature RNA is higher in the IPed lane than in the input one ). ( III ) Binding of Sfp1 to mRNA is dependent on RapBS, suggesting that the same Sfp1 recruited to the promoter by Rap1 binds the transcript

. Following the import, Sfp1 binds to specific promoters and regulates transcription, closing the circle of gene expression regulation ( Figure 8B ). In this way, the synthesis and decay of Sfp1-regulated mRNAs are coordinated in a manner that maintains proper mRNA levels of a specific subset of genes. The capacity of Sfp1 to bind mature mRNA adds additional complexity to the expression of CRAC + genes

. Sfp1 negatively affects transcription elongation, as deletion of SFP1 results in a higher Pol II elongation rate ( Begley et al., 2019 ). Consistently, Sfp1 seems to enhance Pol II backtracking as a deletion of SFP1 suppresses the effect of TFIIS deletion on transcription ( Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012a ). A characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II is the displacement of nascent RNA 3’ end from the active site ( Cheung and Cramer, 2011 )

. We discovered that Sfp1 regulates both transcription and mRNA decay through its capacity to bind RNAs co-transcriptionally. The Sfp1-mediated cross-talk between mRNA synthesis and decay results in the cooperation of these opposing processes to increase mRNA abundance, by stimulating the former and repressing the latter. This cooperation is limited to a subgroup of Sfp1 targets, most of which are also Rap1 targets

., 2012b ). Based on the following observations, we propose that Sfp1 binds to Pol II in proximity to both DNA and Rpb4, accompanying Pol II during elongation and influencing its configuration, thereby enhancing its propensity to backtrack ( Figure 8A ) : ( I ) Sfp1 physically interacts with Rpb4, either directly or indirectly ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

., 2011 ), only the mRNA transcribed by construct B bound Sfp1 ( Figure 3B ). To determine whether RapBS is responsible for Sfp1 RNA binding, we first introduced a RapBS mutation in the promoter of a S1 target gene and found that S1 no longer bound the transcript ( Figure 3 ). This indicates that Rap is necessary and sufficient for S1 binding to nascent RNA. The interaction of S1 with nascent RNA is dependent on its chromatin binding ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that S1 is recruited to the promoter by Rap and then interacts with the transcript. The interaction of S1 with nascent RNA is dependent on its chromatin binding ( Figure 3 ) suggesting that S1 is recruited to the promoter by Rap and interacts with the transcript. The interaction of S1 with nascent is dependent on its chromatin binding ( Figure 3 ) suggesting that S is recruited the promoter by Rap and interacts the transcript. The interaction of S with nascent is dependent its chromatin ( Figure 3 ) suggesting S is recruited promoter by Rap and interacts transcript. The interaction S with nascent dependent its chrom ( Figure 3 ) that S recruited promoter by Rap interacts transcript.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.

   . indica-induced root growth promotion. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.

In this study, we investigated the functional link between dPCD and microbial accommodation in roots. Impaired dPCD in the Arabidopsis smb-3 and bfn1-1 mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte S. indica. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root, suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding smb-3 roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization

. While we show that dPCD protects the meristem from microbial colonization, we propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation by S. indica remains to be investigated

. indica accommodation in Arabidopsis, we performed transcriptome analysis, tracking developmental cell death-marker gene expression during different colonization stages ( Olvera-Carrillo et al., 2015 ). The major regulator in LRCs, SMB, showed no significant changes in expression during fungal colonization ( Figure 4A and C ). However, in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica, there was a significant decrease in BFN1 expression observed after 6 dpi ( Figure 4B and C )

., 2024 ) in the older part of the root, independent of fungal colonization and suggest activation of BFN1 during root epidermal cell aging/senescence. Next, we inoculated the pBFN1 reporter lines with S. indica and observed a reduction in promoter activity in epidermal cells that were in contact with the fungus compared with mock-treated roots ( Figure 4E and F ). BFN1 expression and nuclear localization in the root cap or xylem was not affected by S

., 2019; Weiß et al., 2016; Wawra et al., 2016; Akum et al., 2015 ), the exact mechanism by which S. indica manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear. Here, we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of smb-3 mutants triggers hypercolonization by S. indica, especially around the meristematic zone, and delays S. indica-induced root growth promotion

. The differences in colonization patterns to the smb-3 mutants likely reflect spatial expression and localization patterns of SMB and BFN1 activity throughout Arabidopsis roots. While the expression of the transcription factor SMB is restricted to the LRC, the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 is expressed in different tissues undergoing dPCD and senescence below and above ground ( Escamez et al., 2020; Farage-Barhom et al., 2008 )

. indica colonization ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). This indicates that the downregulation of BFN1 by S. indica occurs mainly in epidermal cells of the differentiation zone and is regulated independently of SMB and its activity in the root cap. To assess the phenotypic effects of BFN1 downregulation, we analyzed Arabidopsis bfn1-1 null mutants ( Fendrych et al., 2014 ) using the cell death and protein aggregates markers, Evans blue and Proteostat

dPCD and corpse clearance are the final steps in LRC differentiation, maintaining root cap organ size in Arabidopsis root tips. This process is orchestrated by the LRC-specific transcription factor SMB and executed by its direct and indirect downstream targets ( Figure 1A ). To characterize the role of disrupted dPCD in Arabidopsis LRCs, we analyzed the phenotypic implications of the SMB loss-of-function allele smb-3 ( Willemsen et al., 2008 )

., 2020; Farage-Barhom et al., 2008 ). This widespread expression establishes BFN1 as a key player in the general regulation of dPCD and senescence processes in various tissues in Arabidopsis. To visualize the extent of BFN1 downregulation upon S. indica colonization in different zones of the root, we used a transgenic BFN1 promoter-reporter line ( pBFN1::NLS-tdTOMATO ) ( Huysmans et al., 2018 ). In agreement with the previously described GUS reporter lines ( Farage-Barhom et al

. In fact, we observed a clearing effect with progressive colonization stages. Furthermore, hypercolonization of Arabidopsis, caused by the loss of dPCD in the root cap, mitigated the beneficial effects of S. indica by delaying the induction of growth promotion. Most notably, we observed hypercolonization of the meristematic zone of smb-3 mutants ( Figure 6 )

., 2020; Farage-Barhom et al., 2008 ). Here, we show that BFN1 is additionally expressed in differentiated root epidermal cells that undergo nuclear degradation during root maturation. This suggests an age-dependent dPCD in the outer epidermal layer of Arabidopsis roots where expression of BFN1 possibly pre-dates cortical and epidermal abscission during secondary root growth and contributes to clearance of cell corpses during periderm emergence ( Wunderling et al., 2018 )

. Aggregated proteins were detected in colonized and adjacent non-colonized cells along the differentiation zone, suggesting a non-cell autonomous host response to the fungus ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). To investigate the biological relevance of BFN1 downregulation during S. indica root colonization, we quantified extraradical fungal growth using the WGA-AF 488 stain. When comparing staining intensities of S

. indica-inoculated smb-3 mutants displayed a clearing of LRC cell corpses from the surface of smb-3 mutant roots over time, while mock-treated smb-3 mutant roots remained littered with LRC cell corpses ( Figure 3F and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). This observation indicates that S. indica is able to degrade uncleared cell corpses, which likely provide additional nutrients that fuel fungal hypercolonization in the smb-3 mutant background. To further explore the role of root dPCD during S

. When comparing staining intensities of S. indica-inoculated bfn1-1 mutants and WT seedlings, we observed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal at the roots of bfn1-1 mutants, indicating a higher extraradical fungal colonization along the differentiation zone ( Figure 5E and F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). However, similar to WT roots, bfn1-1 mutants did not exhibit fungal colonization around the meristematic zone as observed in smb-3-colonized roots ( Figure 5E )

. Together, these findings indicate that loss of SMB activity in the root cap results in an accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses that promotes fungal colonization from the meristematic to the differentiation zone. Therefore, we postulate that the continuous clearance of root cap cells in WT roots is important to limit microbial colonization along the entire root axis and prevent microbial colonization in the meristematic zone. Interestingly, Evans blue cell death staining of S

Intraradical colonization by S. indica was quantified by comparing fungal and plant single-copy housekeeping marker genes using quantitative PCR ( qPCR ), after washing of roots to remove outer fungal mycelium. The results showed a significant increase in intraradical fungal accommodation in smb-3 mutants compared to WT roots ( Figure 2C ). To assess the biological implications of hypercolonization, we measured S. indica-induced root growth in WT and smb-3 mutants. While S

. To validate the RNA-Seq analysis, we performed whole-root qPCR of WT mock- and colonized-roots, confirming BFN1 downregulation at the onset of cell death in S. indica colonization ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 )., 2019; Wra et al.,2016; Ak et al.,2015,2019; Wra et al,2016; et al.2015,201; et al.201,201; et al.201,201; et al.201,201; et al.201,201; al.201,201; et al.201,201; al.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et.201,201; et201.,201; et201,201; et.201,201; et201,201; et201,201; et201,201;201; et,201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;201;

    Title: 
    Abstract: Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.

   . The requirement of sperm and oocytes for neuronal exopher production raises the obvious question as to whether fertilized eggs/embryos are required for ALMR exophergenesis ( Figure 1I ). C. elegans genes impacting fertilization and embryonic development have been studied in exquisite detail ( Greenstein, 2005; Stein and Golden, 2018; Rose and Gönczy, 2014; Schneider and Bowerman, 2003 )

. To begin to dissect the role of egg pressure in promoting exophergenesis, we analyzed the physical relationships of neurons, eggs, and uterine shape. Eggs can readily be observed to distort tissue structure in young adult C. elegans

. ALMR neurons in the germline-less glp-4 mutant produced significantly fewer exophers on Ad1-4 as compared to age- and temperature-matched controls. Given that lack of functional germ cells impaired neuronal exopher production, we sought to test whether oocytes or sperm might be specifically required for exophergenesis, taking advantage of C. elegans genetic reagents available for the manipulation of gamete development

. We tested embryonic development genes known for roles at particular stages for impact on neuronal exopher levels using RNAi knockdown approaches. In C. elegans fertilization, as the mature oocyte encounters the sperm-filled spermatheca, a single sperm enters the mature ovulated oocyte ( fertilization time 0 ), triggering the rapid events of egg activation, which include polyspermy block, eggshell formation, completion of meiotic divisions and extrusion of polar bodies

. However, when we treated with lin-39 RNAi to induce egg retention, we measured ~60% exophergenesis ( Figure 3H ). Thus regardless of the expression levels of exogenous proteins in the ALMR neuron, the egg retention condition can induce high exopher production. Neurotransmitters octopamine ( OA ) and serotonin ( 5-HT ) have been well-documented to play opposing roles in C. elegans egg-laying behavior ( Chase and Koelle, 2007 ). Feeding C

., 2023 ). Clearing the nervous system ( and other organs ) for optimal function might confer a selective advantage for successful maternal reproduction. In this regard, it is fascinating that the peak exopher production period is coincident with a proteostasis reconfiguration that has been well documented to accompany reproduction onset in young adult C. elegans. In brief, during larval development, C

Across species, the production of exopher-like vesicles may also be enhanced by mechanical signals anchored outside of reproduction

. report that exophers produced by C. elegans muscle cells follow a similar time course of highest production at adult day 2, and demonstrated a dependence of the temporal muscle exophergenesis pattern on eggs, and commonly with highest exopher production in muscles in the vicinity of the uterus ( Turek et al., 2021 ) ( muscle exophers may be released to supply nutrients to developing progeny )

., 2013 ). To probe which FUdR outcome might confer exopher suppression, we first addressed whether disruption of progeny production by alternative genetic means might suppress exophergenesis, which would implicate a viable germline as a factor in exopher modulation. In the assembly line-like hermaphrodite C. elegans gonad, germline stem cells close to the signaling distal tip cell ( DTC ) proliferate by mitosis ( diagram of C. elegans gonad and germ cell development in Figure 1D )

C. elegans reproduction features physical expansion and contraction of multiple tissue/cell types--the gonad houses the expanding germline, and the spermatheca expands and retracts vigorously as each mature oocyte enters and exits. The uterus also stretches to house eggs and can contract locally as eggs transit or are expelled via the action of the vulval and uterine muscles

. We document that uterine expansion, rather than chemical signals emanating from fertilized eggs, correlates strongly with the level of exopher production and suggest a model in which mechanical signaling, normally induced across generations from egg to parent via uterine stretch, is a license for proteostressed neurons to release potentially toxic materials in large extracellular vesicles

., 2017; Cooper et al., 2021; Arnold et al., 2023 ), an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in a physiological context, directly through the transparent cuticle ( Corsi et al., 2015 ). More specifically, C. elegans adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers ( ~5 µm; 100 X larger than exosomes ) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron ( Melentijevic et al., 2017; Cooper et al

. Feeding C. elegans octopamine strongly suppresses egg-laying to induce egg retention, while supplementing with 5-HT causes hyperactive egg-laying ( Horvitz et al., 1982 ). Consistent with outcomes in animals physically blocked for egg-laying, treatment with egg retention-promoting OA enhanced ALMR exophergenesis ( Figure 3I )

. Given that under normal reproductive conditions of egg-laying proficiency, correctly shelled eggs are required for the early peak in exopher production, a plausible hypothesis was that fertilized eggs might produce an essential diffusible factor that stimulates neuronal exopher-genesis. However, exophers can be produced abundantly in the absence of fertilized eggs when the vulva is unable to open and release uterine contents, resulting in uterine distention due to debris filling

All strains used in this study carry the transgene bzIs166[Pmec-4::mCherry] to mark the six touch receptor neurons: ALMR, ALML, AVM, PVM, PLMR, and PLML. The genotype of C. elegans strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. We maintained all C. elegans strains on nematode growth media ( NGM ) seeded with OP50-1 Escherichia coli in a 20 °C or 15 °C incubator. We kept all animals on food for at least 10 generations before using them in a test

. How might the presence of eggs signal to the maternal neurons to induce exophers? We consider two main possibilities: ( 1 ) eggs filling the uterus might exert physical pressure that activates essential stretch-signaling for young adult neuronal exopher release

. We confirmed that goa-1 ( n1134 ) retains few eggs in the uterus and is associated with a significantly lower number of ALMR exopher events as compared to the age-matched wild-type control ( Figure 3J ). In sum, manipulation of uterine egg occupancy is strongly correlated with the extent of ALMR neuronal exophergenesis—high egg retention promotes high exophergenesis and low egg retention is associated with low exophergenesis

. We conclude that fertilization, egg shells, and egg remnants are not essential for the early adult exopher peak. Expansion of the uterus with unfertilized oocytes can suffice to elevate neuronal exopher formation. The above-described experiments left open the possibility that the lack of a functional egg-laying apparatus itself might be causative in the elevation of exopher production

. What is the source of the force that promotes exopher production? Elegant work on the egg-laying circuit ( comprising the somatic gonad, the HSN and VC neurons, the vulval muscles, and the utine has shown that egg-laying is regulated by a complex interplay of chemical and mechanical signals ( Chase and Koelle,2007 ; Feeding et al, 202 ). The uter expansion is a critical component of the egg-laying process, as it houses the expanding germl and the spermathe and contracts as mature oocytes are released ( Figure 1D ). We propose that utine expansion is the source of the mechanical force that induces exopheresis in the ALMR neuron

To test the hypothesis that utine expansion is the source of the force that induces exesis, we examined the relationship between uter shape and ALMR exoph production ( Figure 2 ). We found that utine expansion is strongly correlated with the level of ALMR exoph production, suggesting that utine expansion is the source of the mechanical force that induces exesis in the AL neuron. We propose a model in which utine expansion is the source of the mechanical force that induces exesis in the AL neuron, and that this force is transmitted to the neuron to induce exophesis. This model is supported by the observation that utine expansion rather than the presence of fertilized eggs correlates with the level of AL exoph production, and that expansion of the uterus with unfertil oocytes is sufficient to elevate exoph production

We propose a model in which utine expansion is the source of the force that inducesesis in the AL neuron, and this force is transmitted to the neuron to induceesis. This model is supported by the observation that utine rather than presence of fertilized eggs correlates with level of ex production, and expansion of uterus with unfertil o is sufficient to elevate ex production.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ). Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients. Here, we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Collectively, our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD.

   . Together, our results show that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways. Our functional studies in the J20 mouse model of AD demonstrate that knocking down DKK3 in J20 mice ameliorates the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus both before and after plaque deposition. Although loss of synapses around amyloid plaques is well described ( Koffie et al

. Thus, in vivo DKK3 loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in J20 mice, supporting the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this AD mouse model. A key feature of AD brains is the loss of synapses around Aβ plaques ( Koffie et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we investigated whether DKK3 affects synapse number around plaques in 9-month-old J20 mice ( Figure 6A )

., 2017; Xiong et al., 2019 ). However, the impact of DKK3 on synapses and cognitive function, which are affected by deficient Wnt signalling ( Jones et al., 2023; Marzo et al., 2016 ), in AD remains to be studied. Studies on DKK3 in AD would shed new light on the mechanisms that contribute to synapse vulnerability in AD. Here, we investigate the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains

Synapse loss is the strongest correlate with cognitive impairment in AD ( Mucke and Selkoe, 2012; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016 ). However, the mechanisms that trigger synaptic changes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the function of the Wnt antagonist DKK3 on synaptic integrity and memory in the healthy and AD brain

., 2012 ), changes in synapse number induced by silencing DKK3 is unlikely to be due to the formation of plaques as we observed similar synaptic changes when plaques are absent. In line with this view, knockdown of DKK3 does not affect the number or size of amyloid plaques in the J20 hippocampus. Moreover, our gain-of-function studies demonstrate that DKK3 directly affects the integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses

. Together, these results demonstrate that loss-of-function of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synapse changes in J20 mice independently of DKK1 before plaque burden starts ( 4-months-old ), and later when amyloid plaque pathology is evident ( 9-month-old ). The finding that DKK3 loss-of-function reverses synaptic changes at early and late stages in J20 mice led us to test whether silencing DKK3 restores hippocampal-mediated learning and memory in these mice ( Figure 7A )

. Functionally, our confocal and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that increased levels of DKK3 trigger the loss of excitatory synapses with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus through different Wnt pathways. Crucially, in vivo downregulation of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic defects in the hippocampus and improves memory in an AD mouse model

. A possible explanation for this finding is that endogenous DKK3 is required for excitatory synapse function without affecting their structural stability. Our results also demonstrate that DKK3 signals through different pathways to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A key component of the canonical Wnt pathway is GSK3β. The activity of GSK3β is increased in the AD brain, which is associated with reduced Wnt signalling ( Leroy et al., 2007 )

. Crucially, downregulation of DKK3 also improves cognitive function, particularly spatial memory, in J20 mice. The rescue of the synaptic and cognitive defects is specific to DKK3 downregulation as no differences in Dkk1 levels, a Wnt antagonist that affects synapses ( Marzo et al., 2016 ), are observed. Our functional studies in the J20 demonstrate a novel role for DKK3 in synaptic and cognitive function

. In summary, our functional studies in mice together with our results obtained from human AD patients strongly support a role for DKK3 in synapse dysfunction and memory impairment in AD.

. Together, our findings in humans and functional studies in mice identify DKK3 as a driver of synapse pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.

. We next examined the Wnt signaling pathways mediating DKK3-induced synaptic changes. Wnts can signal through different pathways, including the Wnt/GSK3 and Wnt/JNK cascades ( Niehrs, 2012; Nusse and Clevers, 2017; Figure 4A&D ). A previous study showed that DKK1 induces synapse loss by blocking the canonical Wnt pathway in the hippocampus ( Marzo et al., 2016 )

. Together, our results indicate that DKK3 induces the loss of excitatory synapses through inhibition of Wnt/GSK3β signaling but increases inhibitory synapses through activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. We next studied the in vivo role of DKK3 by downregulating DKK3 in adult WT mice using a viral transduction approach

. Importantly, it remains unexplored whether amelioration of Wnt deficiency restores synaptic connectivity and memory in AD. Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ), a member of the secreted Wnt antagonist DKK family, could contribute to AD pathogenesis. Like other DKKs, DKK3 has two cysteine-rich domains but it also contains an elongated N-terminus with a Soggy domain ( Krupnik et al., 1999; Niehrs, 2006 ). Although studies suggest that DKK3 antagonizes the Wnt canonical pathway ( Caricasole et al

., 2003; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). Thus, DKK3 affects excitatory synapse number through the Wnt/GSK3β pathway. Next, we investigated if DKK3 increases inhibitory synapses through canonical Wnt signaling by blocking GSK3 using BIO. In contrast to excitatory synapses, BIO did not affect DKK3’s impact on inhibitory synapse density ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ). Therefore, DKK3 regulates inhibitory synapse density independently of the Wnt/GSK3β pathway

. Given that DKK3 is a secreted protein, we examined total and extracellular levels of DKK3 from acute hippocampal slices of wild-type ( WT ) and J20 mice at 3–4 months before plaques appear. Although the total DKK3 levels did not differ between J20 and WT mice in the brain homogenate, DKK3 levels were significantly increased ( 2. 54-fold ) in the extracellular fraction of J20 mice ( Figure 2E ). In a second AD mouse model, NLGF, extracellular DKK3 levels were also elevated by 2

., 2022 ). These findings are in agreement with other proteomic studies showing increased levels of DKK3 in different brain areas, including the hippocampus and in cortical synaptosomes of AD patients ( Hesse et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019 ). Together, our findings in AD patients suggest that increased DKK3 levels in the brain could underlie synapse dysfunction in AD. Amyloid plaques are a prominent neuropathological feature of AD

. To investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synaptic changes in AD, we knocked down DKK3 in the hippocampus of J20 mice at two different disease stages using AAV9-Scr shRNA or AAV9-Dkk3 shRNA ( Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ). J20 mice exhibit excitatory synapse loss in the hippocampus at 4 months of age ( early stage ), whereas plaque deposition starts around 5 months and is widely distributed in the cortex and hippocampus by 9 months ( late stage ) ( Hong et al

. In addition, our results using human AD brain samples provide strong support for the contribution of DKK to synapse in AD.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.

    We investigated whether pyoverdines produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. have antibacterial activities against human opportunistic pathogens through iron sequestration and withholding this trace element from pathogens. Our screen involving 320 environmental isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed five top pyoverdine candidates with broad-spectrum activity

., 2008; Rehm et al., 2022 ) and have an extremely high affinity for iron ( Ka = 1032 M–1, pyoverdine produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens biotype B ) ( Meyer and Abdallah, 1978 ). For these reasons, we propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition

. To test our hypothesis, we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, we elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition

., 2012; Niehus et al., 2017 ). Here, we apply the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. Specifically, we investigate whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens. We focus on pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity that are produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp

. When administered as treatment to infected G. mellonella larvae, we observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts. Furthermore, we found low toxicity of pyoverdines at effective concentrations and observed low potentials for resistance evolution. Overall, our results reveal pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp

. as potent antibacterials against several human opportunistic pathogens. Our novel treatment approach assumes that pyoverdines sequester iron and thereby induce iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. Several of our findings support this view. First, the growth-inhibiting effect of our top pyoverdine candidates exclusively occurred under iron-limited conditions, while pathogen growth was restored under iron-replete conditions ( Figure 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 )

. baumannii and S. aureus that have less efficient siderophores and are unable to use the pyoverdine as iron source. For every new treatment, it is important to consider whether it has unintentional consequences for the targeted pathogen. Because our approach does not kill pathogens directly, there are multiple ways of how pathogens may react to pyoverdine treatment

. aeruginosa and S. aureus was not linked to mechanisms directly enhancing the pathogen’s iron acquisition but with mutations in global regulators, metabolism, biofilm, and motility genes. In A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, no evidence for resistance evolution was observed. Moreover, certain pathogens lost mobile genetic elements containing virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, suggesting that pyoverdine treatment could selects for less virulent and antibiotic-sensitive strains

., 2012 ). Regarding pyoverdine treatment, this means that pathogens with regular siderophores will hit a double wall: their siderophores are immobilized by siderocalins, while pyoverdines lock away the remaining iron. Another promising finding of our work is that the potential for resistance evolution against pyoverdines seems low. Conceptually, one reason for low-resistance evolution could be that pyoverdines, unlike many antibiotics, are not internalized into bacterial cells

. The two competing pyoverdines likely have similar iron affinities and the presence of pyoverdine receptors in the pathogen might foster the uptake of the supplemented pyoverdine. Our results indeed support the view that pyoverdine treatment is not effective against P. aeruginosa. Taken together, we predict that pyoverdine treatment could be highly potent against certain pathogens like A. baumannii and S

. These candidates could be distinguished from non-inhibitory pyoverdines by their high CCS values ( standing for larger and more complex molecules ) and their higher iron complexation stability. Experiments with crude- and HPLC-purified pyoverdines showed that pyoverdines completely stall the growth of A. baumannii and S. aureus, while showing intermediate activity against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. When administered as treatment to infected G

. In support of our hypothesis that the inhibitory effects of pyoverdines operate via withholding iron from pathogens, we found no growth inhibition when the pathogens were exposed to purified ferribactin ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), the non-iron chelating precursor of pyoverdine. To further validate that the antibacterial effect of pyoverdine is due to iron sequestration, we saturated pyoverdine s3b09 with varying concentrations of iron and repeated the dose–response experiment with A

. We propose that differences can be explained by the various strategies of these pathogens to cope with iron stress. A. baumannii and S. aureus produce siderophores that have a much simpler chemical structures than pyoverdines and are expected to bind iron with lower affinity ( A. baumannii: acinetobactin [association constant: 1026 M–1], fimsbactin [1027 M–1], and baumannoferrin [unknown] [Bohac et al., 2019; Shapiro and Wencewicz, 2016; Sheldon and Skaar, 2020], S

. The two molecules are identical apart from one ring in the chromophore core that is not cyclized and not oxidized in ferribactin, which compromises the binding of iron. These findings suggest that pyoverdine does not target the pathogens directly, but rather indirectly via the induction of iron starvation. We observed that pyoverdines showed pathogen-specific efficacies in curbing bacterial growth ( Figure 3 )

., 2022 ). Due to its compromised iron-binding capacity, we used it as a negative control for which no activity against pathogens is expected ( Nadal-Jimenez et al., 2014 ). As positive treatment control, we used the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. We subjected the four pathogens to the three pyoverdine variants, ferribactin, and ciprofloxacin across a concentration gradient and measured their effects on pathogen growth ( Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). For A. baumannii and S

. These properties reduce the likelihood of their exploitation as iron sources by pathogens and provide a competitive advantage over siderophores with lower iron affinities. Combined with low toxicity to hosts at therapeutically effective concentrations and minimal potential for resistance evolution, these natural chelators hold promise as a new class of effective antibacterials, either as standalone treatments or in combination with conventional antibiotics.

. We add a strong heterologous siderophore as treatment to withhold iron from pathogens to curb their growth. The concept of targeting bacterial infections with both natural and synthetic iron-chelators has been highlighted in the literature for quite some time ( Qiu et al., 2011; Kontoghiorghes et al., 2010; Ribeiro et al., 2022; Coraça-Huber et al., 2018; Hatcher et al., 2009 )

. In complex communities, the inhibitory effect of pyoverdine on the pathogen may get diluted as the burden of increased iron limitation is shared across community members. All these considerations show that it will be crucial to assess the consequences of pyoverdine treatments in more complex settings including hosts. Not only bacteria but also host cells need iron. Consequently, pyoverdine treatment could negatively affect host iron homeostasis

. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae, P. chlororaphis ) that are non-pathogenic to humans and can produce and secrete pyoverines with high affinities. These pyoverines have the potential to inhibit the growth of opportunistic pathogens by sequestering iron and withholding trace element from pathogens.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists. As such, our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Results we present in the current study establish a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism explaining how reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits. We provide evidence that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations

. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony. Although prior modeling studies have addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks ( Brunel and Wang, 2003; Compte et al., 2000; Kirli et al

. Although these modeling studies provide important mechanistic insight into prefrontal network dynamics underlying working memory, and potentially, working memory deficits in schizophrenia ( Goldman-Rakic, 1999 ), they do not address the topic of the current study, which is how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input received by the network jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA

., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ). Whereas these studies suggested that NMDAR synaptic function and spike timing in prefrontal networks were linked, they did not elucidate the circuit mechanisms responsible. In the current study, we developed a spiking neural network model to understand mechanisms that might mediate the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics ( reduced 0-lag synchronous spiking ) we observed in biological data ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al

. These include the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking between individual prefrontal neurons when external inputs to the network push it across this state boundary, and failure of synchronous spiking to emerge between prefrontal neurons when NMDAR synaptic currents are reduced, as we have observed in neural recordings in primate prefrontal cortex ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ).

NMDAR synaptic malfunction has been implicated as causal in schizophrenia ( Fromer et al., 2014; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014; Timms et al., 2013 ), and loss of NMDAR synaptic function in prefrontal networks is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits as well as clinical symptoms in the disease ( Goldman-Rakic, 1999; Javitt et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 )

., 2018 ), although this remains a possibility. Network simulations that accurately incorporate as many of these biological variables as possible may be useful in predicting how spike timing changes that may emerge downstream of schizophrenia risk factors would be likely to influence synaptic connectivity in the human cortex. In addition, as noted, genetic linkage studies have implicated altered NMDAR function in schizophrenia ( Fromer et al

. Given these considerations, the convergent spike desynchronization we observed in monkey drug and mouse genetic models could be explained by an inverted U-shaped relationship wherein either too little NMDAR function ( as produced by NMDAR blockade in monkeys ) or too much NMDAR function ( as predicted to result from deletion of Dgcr8 in mice ) decreases the frequency of 0-lag spiking between prefrontal neurons ( Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 )

., 2014; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014 ). Since NMDAR play a central role in the molecular mechanisms that implement STDP in the brain, disruption of NMDAR synaptic transmission in schizophrenia may alter STDP directly, independently of the impact of disrupted NMDAR function on neural spiking dynamics in the disease state. We had previously reported that blocking NMDAR in monkeys ( Zick et al

. To address these questions, we recently investigated how blocking NMDAR altered neural dynamics and effective communication between neurons in prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive control task measuring deficits in schizophrenia ( Blackman et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2010; Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2018 )

., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 ). However, we do not have a complete understanding of how NMDAR synaptic mechanisms influence neural dynamics in prefrontal networks, nor how the disruption of NMDAR synaptic mechanisms might cause prefrontal networks to malfunction

., 1989; Goldman-Rakic, 1995 ). Prior theoretical studies have investigated circuit and synaptic mechanisms that can generate persistent activity in recurrent prefrontal networks, specifically addressing how reducing NMDAR function destabilizes attractor states ( patterns of stable neural activity ) in these networks during a delay period ( when the memory of the stimulus must be retained ) leading to working memory deficits ( Calvin and Redish, 2021; Compte et al., 2000; Funahashi et al

., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ). The network is comprised of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons embedded in a sparsely connected recurrent network employing realistic NMDAR, GABAR, and AMPAR mediated synaptic currents. We use network stability and mean field analyses to investigate how the balance between NMDA and AMPA components of recurrent excitatory and GABA inhibitory currents influence regimes of network dynamics and spiking synchrony

. Thus, no prior modeling study captures the relationship between NMDAR synaptic mechanisms, spike timing, and network oscillations that we have observed in neural recordings ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2018 ), and for which we provide a theoretical explanation in the current report. We previously hypothesized that reduced synchrony at the level of spiking neurons ( Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al

. The increase in spike rate was also reduced, although less dramatically ( Figure 1D, magenta ). We term this effect as NMDAR blockage induced desynchronization of spiking activity. To understand the phenomenon of drug-induced desynchronization of spiking activity and the role played by various components of synaptic currents, we considered a spiking network model representing a local circuit of monkey PFC

. The current results allow us to establish strong parallels between simulated and biological data, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking via recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons during behavior, the association between synchronous spiking and oscillatory population activity, as well as their joint dependence on NMDAR synaptic mechanisms, both in our current simulation and in the neural data ( Zick et al., 2018 ).

., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ) could disconnect prefrontal local circuits via spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity ( STDP; Dan and Poo, 2004; Feldman, 2012 ), contributing to the reduction in dendritic spine density that has been observed in postmortem analysis of prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia ( Glantz and Lewis, 2000; MacDonald et al., 2017 )

. Secondly, the effect of drug administration is modeled by setting NMDAR conductances gNMDA, E and gNMDA, I to zero. The capacity of the prefrontal network model to provide a circuit mechanism for the emergence of synchrony in spiking activity and drug-dependent desynchronization can be illustrated by considering the system’s behavior in the ( vX/vX∗, gNMDA/gNMDA∗ ) state plane around the point ( vX/vX∗=1, gNMDA/gNMDA∗=1 ) corresponding to the boundary between synchronous and asynchronous states. In this region, the network exhibits oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior, but reducing NAR synaptic currents prevents the network from transitioning to this state, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-l spiking synchrony.
Researchers investigated the process of angiogenesis, specifically the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, in hypoxic environments. They found that the initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St phenotypes, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. Using a controlled angiogenesis model and mathematical analysis, they discovered that spatial patterning of Tip-St cell specification undergoes an order-disorder transition at high levels of pro-angiogenic VEGF, resulting in robust but unstable differentiation for most cells, with a subset of presumptive Tip cells sprouting. Sprouts form in a manner consistent with a Turing-like model, dependent on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. NOT signaling mediates robust differentiation but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization mechanisms.

The study focused on enabling vascular morphogenesis through environmentally responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St states, guided by proangi cues such as VEG and tissue organization mediated by paracrine-Delta-NOTCH signaling. Mathematical models of this process need to be tested for causality, but Turing mechanisms appear to explain experimental results. Analysis supports dynamic view of angi induction, VEG input inducing NOT signaling and Tip cells behaving as sprouts. Inputs specifying cell fate can be contradictory, with VEG promoting Tip fate and NOT signaling neighboring cells promoting St, suppressing Tip identity.

A model was calibrated to match experimental Tip-St fractions at VEG input, enabling comparison between predictions and observations. Spatial patterning of Tip cells in angiogenesis was quantified. Endothelial induction may contrast with complex processes like epithelial migration, NOT modulating leader and follower cells, underscoring need for refined models integrating biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-St fate.

Simulations of VEG-NOT signaling in a hexagonal multicellular endothelium showed distributions of Delta and NOT expression. A framework for analysis of cell determination was extended to a multicellular hexagonal lattice, incorporating NOT and VEG pathways. Instabilities may lead oscillatory fluctuations NOT signaling, observed in differentiation and endothelial sheets under high VEG inputs. Poised states may be undifferentiated neuroprogenitors displaying oscillatory NOT, proceeding to differentiation after oscillation.

Results suggest VEG dual role in initial Tip-St differentiation, inducing Delta-NOT signaling and classical salt-and-pepper pattern, approximately 25% cells adopting Tip fate. VEG proangiogenic promoting Tip fate conflicts with NOT signaling neighboring cells promoting St, suppressing Tip identity, disordered patterns deviating from salt-pe configuration.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.

   . Our data suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long term memory formation. However, it remains unclear which neurotransmitter the LC releases into the dHPC during these responses. Canonically, the LC is known as the primary source of norepinephrine in the forebrain ( Jones and Moore, 1977; Lindvall and Björklund, 1974; Pickel et al., 1974; Schwarz and Luo, 2015 )

., 2004 ). Based on this previous work and our data showing learning-related activity in LC-HPC projections, we believe that LC release of dopamine into the hippocampus is at least partially responsible for our observed effects. However, future work manipulating this projection directly would be required to make this conclusion

. We extend this data by providing direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the HPC and by showing that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not.

., 2000; Tully et al., 2007 ). Given our data showing that dopamine, and not norepinephrine, is required for trace fear memory formation, the most direct possibility is that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning

The locus coeruleus and its interaction with the hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation ( Compton et al., 1995; Kempadoo et al., 2016; Lemon et al., 2009; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). However, due to the predominant use of spatial memory tasks in which the learned information is experienced diffusely in time, the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood

., 2016 ), and retrieval ( Murchison et al., 2004; Sara and Devauges, 1988 ). Here, we extended this data by showing that precisely timed phasic activation of the locus coeruleus enhances memory formation. Specifically, our data indicate that phasic LC activation can enhance memory formation when the relevant stimuli are not salient enough to produce significant learning on their own. There are multiple possibilities as to the mechanism underlying this enhancement

. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine ( Kempadoo et al., 2016; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling

. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks ( Giustino and Maren, 2018; Lisman and Grace, 2005; Selden et al., 1990; Uematsu et al., 2017; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory ( Bach et al., 1999; Kempadoo et al

., 2022 ). Therefore, while it is not possible to completely rule out increased hippocampal dopamine via a LC-midbrain-HPC circuit based on our studies, direct release of dopamine from LC terminals in HPC is more likely. A wide body of evidence suggests that LC activation enhances memory acquisition ( Kempadoo et al., 2016 ), consolidation ( LaLumiere et al., 2003; Novitskaya et al., 2016; Takeuchi et al., 2016 ), and retrieval ( Murchison et al

., 2008 ). First, recent studies have shown that activation of LC terminals in the dorsal hippocampus induces the release of dopamine ( Kempadoo et al., 2016 ). Second, inactivation of LC but not VTA terminals in the dorsal hippocampus decreases dopamine release in this region ( Gálvez-Márquez et al., 2022 )

. LC responses at these key task-related events are overtly evident in LC GCaMP traces averaged across trials and on each trial individually ( Figure 3A, B and C ). We next examined whether the specific projection from the LC to the dorsal hippocampus ( dHPC ) exhibits similar phasic responses during trace fear conditioning

., 2006; Schwarz and Luo, 2015 ). Given that LC activation drives the release of both NE and DA in the dHPC, we sought to determine which of these neurotransmitters contributes to trace fear memory formation. To test this, we trained animals in trace fear conditioning after administering either norepinephrine or dopamine receptor antagonists and tested their memory the next day ( Figure 6A )

. In these experiments, we used trace fear conditioning to examine the contribution of precisely timed phasic LC and LC-HPC activity to long-term memory formation. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that the LC exhibits responses to both neutral and aversive stimuli. This data is consistent with previous reports ( Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981; Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994; Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986 )

The locus coeruleus ( LC ) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state

. First, both dopamine ( Frey et al., 1990; Lisman et al., 2011 ) and norepinephrine ( Bliss et al., 1983; Hu et al., 2007; Stanton and Sarvey, 1985 ) enhance synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and in other structures important for trace fear conditioning, including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala ( Bissière et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2000; Tully et al., 2007 )

. Taken together, these data indicate that dHPC dopamine, but not norepinephrine, is critical for trace fear memory formation. In some memory paradigms, dopamine release in the dHPC has been suggested to mediate the consolidation, rather than the encoding of memories ( Broussard et al., 2016; O’Carroll et al., 2006; Rossato et al., 2009; Takeuchi et al., 2016 )

. To test whether dopamine is required for trace fear memory formation, we administered the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 ( 0. 1 mg/kg ) 30 min before training, as D1/D5 receptors have previously been shown to be critical for other types of hippocampus-dependent memory and plasticity ( Frey et al., 1990; Huang and Kandel, 1995; O’Carroll et al., 2006; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 )

. The LC may also assert its effect on memory formation indirectly via its influence over sensory processing, attention, or valence processing, all of which are affected by phasic LC activity ( Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Bouret and Sara, 2004; McCall et al., 2015; Vazey et al., 2018 ). Under this hypothesis, the LC could facilitate memory by enhancing the responses of neural populations involved in processing, attending, or assigning valence to the learning-relevant stimuli

. This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning, but the lack of experimental control over the animals’ sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination in this study.
