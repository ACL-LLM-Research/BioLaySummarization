The article presents a stochastic mathematical model for gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), also known as sleeping sickness, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The model is used to assess the progress towards elimination of transmission (EoT) in different regions and identify areas where intervention efforts should be focused. The model is applied to the Mosango health zone in Kwilu province, which has 16 health areas with approximately 10,000 people each. The stochastic model is fitted to case data using a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology, allowing for the quantification of uncertainty in the results. The analysis shows that the health area of Kinzamba II, which accounts for one-third of the health zone's cases, is predicted to have the latest expected year for EoT under current intervention strategies. The study also compares the performance of deterministic and stochastic models, finding that deterministic fits are computationally faster but produce virtually indistinguishable results. The authors suggest that deterministic fits should be used for efficiency, while stochastic projections should be used to capture parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations. This study provides a new framework for highly detailed calibration and projections of future gHAT infections for a range of intervention scenarios in the DRC.
The article presents a novel approach for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TMEs) using spatial K functions and functional data analysis to predict patient outcomes and identify important spatial relationships between cell types and proteins. The method is designed to summarize spatial relationships in TMEs and apply random forest models to predict outcomes such as patient survival and treatment success with emerging immunotherapies. The approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments and is resistant to overfitting and false discovery rate. The method is then applied to two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. For the TNBC data, the approach is used to compare two groups of tumors based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions. The method begins by producing K functions for different cell-cell and marker-marker interactions within images, followed by dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis and combination with non-functional patient metadata. A modified random forest model is then used to predict patient outcomes. The approach aims to identify significant differences between patient groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes, protein antigens, or a mixture thereof, and to predict which group a new patient belongs to using their TME and metadata. The proposed method is publicly available in a companion R package called funkycells.
The study computationally investigates how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-evolve during synchronization and desynchronization processes in neural networks. The authors employ a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. A simple stochastic SP model is introduced to accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP. The study reveals that structural reorganization can remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony, particularly when weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning. The strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. The study also compares the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model with the desynchronization of models with combined plasticity mechanisms, showing that the latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies aiming to induce long-lasting relief of symptoms in brain disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.
The regeneration of large missing regions of the nervous system in some animals poses a significant challenge due to the need to restore the pattern, numbers, and wiring of diverse neuron classes. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors, with neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location. These findings suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types. This model proposes that delta-2 acts in neurons and notch-1 acts in phagocytic progenitors during the regeneration of glia, providing a candidate solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia. The Notch signaling pathway, essential for cell-fate specification and tissue patterning, may also play a role in planarian glia regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal progenitors.
This study investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1. The researchers analyzed the surface marker expression of γδ T cells in individuals with and without neutralization breadth during acute HIV infection (AHI). They found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. The expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells was found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and was associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. Additionally, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells were associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. These findings suggest that γδ T cells may promote the development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies. The study also found that Vδ2+ T cells were significantly reduced during early AHI and their loss was associated with viral load. The results of this study provide new insights into the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to HIV-1 and may inform the development of strategies to improve vaccine-induced humoral immune responses.
The spread of cancer from organ to organ, known as metastasis, is responsible for the majority of cancer deaths. Current anti-cancer drugs primarily target tumor growth rather than metastasis. Recent research has identified that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. A novel bispecific antibody, BS1, has been developed to block the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, significantly reducing metastatic burden in preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies, which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, offer enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects, making them a promising modality for drug development. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition is crucial for maximizing their efficacy. A quantitative, computational model of the BS1 bispecific antibody has been developed to provide insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and guide therapeutic design. The model simulates the binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, demonstrating how the balance of binary and ternary complexes drives receptor inhibition. The results provide important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design. The study suggests that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality.
The study investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, in acentrosomal spindle assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 is the mammalian homolog of which is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division, but its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Depletion of ZYG-8 from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Additionally, ZYG-8 was found to be required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle, and kinase activity was necessary for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. The study proposes that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in C. elegans oocytes: regulating microtubule dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and influencing the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain, and previous studies have shown that it is required for proper spindle positioning in C. elegans mitotically dividing embryos. The study provides new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division and sheds light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles.
This study investigated the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk using the UK Biobank dataset and the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, primarily spanning lipid-related classes. In contrast, twice as many metabolites were found to be causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. An interaction quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions showed attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis were significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but were not associated with T2D risk, suggesting that T2D affects the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Additionally, 165 metabolites were associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Notably, 40 of these metabolites were not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. The study provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications.
The study investigated the genetic basis of tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. Two mouse lines, CC061 and CC024, were used: CC061 is highly susceptible to MRSA infection, while CC024 is tolerant. A cross between the two lines generated F1 and F2 populations, which were infected with MRSA USA300. The results showed that the F1 generation had a 65% survival rate, while the F2 generation had a 55% survival rate, indicating a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak was identified on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. The WSB/EiJ allele, present in CC024 mice, contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, which are receptors for the complement factor C5a, have high-impact variants in this region. It is hypothesized that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival. The study suggests that the genetic factors underlying tolerance to MRSA infection are complex and involve multiple genes, including C5ar1 and C5ar2.
This study investigated the impact of genetic networks on adaptation during an adaptive walk scenario, where a population evolves towards a phenotypic optimum. The authors modeled a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif, and compared it to an additive model. The results showed that both models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected, with the network model exhibiting a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The study found that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. The authors also observed that both network and additive models exhibited similarities in key aspects of their adaptive walks, such as the number of adaptive steps and the distribution of fitness effects among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than the additive model on average. The study highlights the importance of considering genetic networks in models of adaptation, as they can significantly influence the distribution of fitness effects and the rate of trait evolution. The findings suggest that traditional models of adaptation, which rely on direct genotype-phenotype relationships, may not accurately capture the complexity of trait evolution in the presence of gene interaction networks.
The article proposes a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses, suggesting that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. The theory posits that apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. The somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior under these assumptions. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains various experimental findings on multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. The biophysics of cortical neurons can be interpreted as Bayesian computations, with the dynamics of conductance-based neuron models naturally computing posterior distributions from Gaussian likelihood functions and prior represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics are derived from stochastic gradient ascent on this posterior distribution, and synaptic plasticity is derived from matching the posterior to a target distribution. The theory predicts neuronal response properties that differ from those of classical neuron models, with somatic membrane potentials reflecting prior expectations in the absence of sensory input. Simulations demonstrate successful learning of a prototypical multisensory integration task.
The study describes the application of the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) to 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. Using ECOD as a basis for classification, the researchers detected and cataloged domains from over 226 million amino acid residues. On average, they provided positive classification for 90% of residues in all proteomes, classifying 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins. The study found that eukaryotes contain a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains compared to bacteria, as well as a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. The researchers also identified highly populated domains shared between eukaryotes and bacteria, such as Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared the sampling of homologous groups from the whole proteome set against the stable ECOD reference and discussed groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. The results suggest a convergence between sequence and structural classifications facilitated by highly accurate structure predictions, particularly among larger well-understood protein families. However, among less populated homologous groups, structural domain classification is still finding domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications. The study provides biological insights for the respective organisms and makes the resulting domains available on the ECOD website. The findings have implications for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets.
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are currently no antiviral treatments. Previous research suggested that BKPyV expresses the large T antigen (TAg) early during infection, promoting cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. However, a new study using single-cell analysis reveals that robust TAg expression actually requires replication of the host DNA first. The study found that BKPyV relies on the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production, contradicting the previous model. Instead, the virus requires an initial host S phase to replicate, similar to other small DNA tumor viruses such as papilloma- and adenoviruses. The study used chemical inhibitors to prevent cellular DNA replication and found that BKPyV production is dependent on an initial S phase. Additionally, the study found that the host DNA is re-replicated during BKPyV infection, and that canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators are required for subsequent rounds of replication. These findings suggest a new model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. This new understanding of the molecular events required for BKPyV production may help identify effective therapeutic targets against the virus.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing TWAS fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, a novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FABIO (Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes) has been developed. FABIO is specifically designed for binary traits and is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. The method employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression (GReX) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. As a result, FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. In simulations, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27.9%-36.9% over existing approaches across traits. The method was also applied to in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank, successfully prioritizing multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits.
This study investigated the roles of Btn2 and Hsp42 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure. The results show that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress and act to sequester misfolded proteins into defined proteostasis quality control (PQC) sites following reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure. The absence of Btn2 and Hsp42 leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide stress. The study identifies the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and shows that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress the formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. The data suggest that protein sequestration is a key antioxidant defense mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 mutants exhibit increased protein aggregation and are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress, indicating a functional role for protein sequestration in oxidant tolerance. The study also shows that the levels of protein oxidative damage are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants, but protein aggregation is elevated in the absence of Btn2 and Hsp42, suggesting that these sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cell's antioxidant defense system. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of protein sequestration in maintaining proteostasis and preventing the toxicity associated with protein misfolding diseases.
A large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screen was conducted to evaluate the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glioblastoma (GBM) invasion. While previous studies have focused on coding genes, this study aimed to identify lncRNAs that contribute to GBM invasion. A total of 2,307 candidate lncRNAs were screened using CRISPRi, and 48 lncRNAs were found to be significantly associated with a decrease in invasion capacity upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown and was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that WASF3, a gene previously implicated in tumor invasion, was highly correlated with LINC03045 expression. Knockdown of WASF3 was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and overexpression of WASF3 rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown. These findings suggest that LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, plays a critical role in GBM invasion and may regulate invasion via WASF3. The results of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM invasion and identify LINC03045 as a potential therapeutic target. The clinical relevance of LINC03045 was further supported by its association with tumor grade and patient survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets.
Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli by analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a stochastic chain of sounds. The study aimed to identify the classes of models used by the brain to assign probabilistic models to these sequences. A new clustering procedure was developed to group EEG signals based on their patterns, allowing the researchers to retrieve the brain's putative model of the sequence of auditory stimuli. This approach enabled the extraction of regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. The results showed that the brain uses the occurrence of strong beats in a stochastic sequence of auditory stimuli to select a model of the random sequence. This finding suggests that the brain relies on the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus to build a model of the sequence. The study contributes to the understanding of how the brain processes and organizes statistical regularities in sequences of stimuli, addressing an open question in the field. The findings have implications for the development of models of brain function and the understanding of how the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli.
This study addresses the limitations of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in analyzing gene expression and cellular composition in solid tissues and organs. The method, which requires cell dissociation for analysis, fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. As a result, there is a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq results using composite scRNA-seq data. To overcome this issue, the authors propose a computationally calculated coefficient, "cell type-specific weighting-factor" (cWF), to offset these limitations. They introduce a method to compute cWFs and report values for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. The authors validate the computed cWFs using five methods, including reconstitution, deconvolution, comparison to experimentally measured transcript-contents, independence from differential cell-type ratios, and prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. The results show that cWFs accurately reconstitute and deconvolve whole-organ RNA-seq data using composite scRNA-seq data and recapitulate experimentally-determined total mRNA content-differences. Furthermore, cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, suggesting their diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanisms. The study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues and organs, and highlights the diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) extends this approach to estimate the direct effects of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, both MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants, which violate one of the core assumptions of instrumental variables. To address this issue, a radial formulation of MVMR and an adapted Galbraith radial plot are proposed, allowing for the visualization of the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis. The radial MVMR approach also includes an option for the removal of outlying SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A corresponding R package, RMVMR, is presented for implementing the methods described. The effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach is demonstrated through simulations and applied analyses, including the estimation of the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease. The radial MVMR approach effectively visualizes causal effect estimates and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. This approach facilitates the assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data.
The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) across multiple timescales, from seconds to days, using high-resolution video recordings at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days. The researchers used a deep learning framework, SLEAP, to track the full-body postures of 47 individual flies, resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. The study identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion, and examined how these behaviors vary across time of day and days in the experiment. The results reveal distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, including trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed, providing new insights into the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Notably, the study found that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, which tracks well with other indicators of health, such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spent moving versus resting. The study also observed a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days, and identified differences in behavioral patterns during morning and evening peaks of activity. These findings provide a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.
This study identifies a novel function for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22 in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A non-biased genetic screen revealed that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 and NEKL-3. Proximity labeling studies identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22, and loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis and co-localization studies implicated PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting a broad role in maintaining tissue structural integrity. Additionally, PTPN-22 was found to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline, as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. These findings highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions. The study also suggests that PTPN-22 may exert opposing effects on one or more common substrates or act on distinct components within a discrete complex or pathway with the NEKLs. Overall, this research expands our understanding of the roles of PTPN-22 beyond immunoregulation and highlights its importance in various cellular processes.
The study presents a comprehensive analysis of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia using a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) gene. The results show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022, with the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrating the most spatial change across the region. The study provides the first data-driven, predictive maps of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion, enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution. These maps estimate drug resistance for locations where no data are available and can be used by health agencies to guide the prioritization of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance. The study's findings are consistent with previous modeling work and underlying data collected to assess the spread of artemisinin resistance. The results provide critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia, where resistance to artemisinin derivatives poses a significant challenge to malaria control efforts. The study highlights the importance of molecular markers associated with resistance, such as the K13 gene, in predicting the spread of artemisinin resistance and informing malaria control strategies.
The inflammasome signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, and function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins, such as NLRP1 and CARD8, are vital components of this pathway. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. Recent studies have shown that NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. The Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) and the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediate these interactions. Additionally, the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complexes. However, DPP9 does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. These findings enhance the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation, highlighting the complexity of their interactions within the immune response. The study demonstrates that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 exist in a steady state characterized by the formation of NT-CT and FL-CT autoinhibitory complexes, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism among these FIIND-containing proteins.
This study investigates the role of Retention in Endoplasmic Reticulum-1 (Rer1) protein in regulating protein homeostasis and cell competition in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Rer1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi compartments, and its loss leads to proteotoxic stress and activation of the PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Clonal analysis reveals that Rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells. Furthermore, Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth, and this upregulation provides cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. The study demonstrates that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and plays a crucial role in competitive cell survival. The findings are consistent with previous studies in yeast, worms, and mouse cerebral cortex, which have shown that Rer1 deficiency induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Overall, this study highlights the importance of Rer1 in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cell competition in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium.
The study investigated the functional impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. The researchers used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test all but two of the 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. The results showed that 770 of the non-synonymous changes were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. The findings correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. This approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. The study used a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants generated by error-prone PCR, screened the library en masse for rad53 complementation, and used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify complementors in the selected yeast. The results from the rad53 complementation screen correlate well with known function or pathogenicity and can be used to functionally classify the 3,187 unique amino acid changes that result from non-synonymous SNVs.
The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibits epigenetic and phenotypic diversity through the formation of multiple intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. These inversions result in distinct genome methylation patterns, which are associated with pathogenesis-related traits. However, the mechanism controlling the orientation of hsdS inversions was previously unknown. This study reveals that the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin (TA) system regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, thereby influencing the bacterial epigenome and associated traits. The SpxA1-TenA system is a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, where the toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. Overexpression of TenA leads to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, while the antitoxin SpxA1 represses the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. TenA binds to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the expression of the alternative sigma factor ComX, which in turn enhances the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, favoring the formation of transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations. The SpxA1-TenA system acts as a programmed genetic switch, generating pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity due to spontaneous variations in the AT dinucleotide repeat region upstream of the spxA1-tenA promoter.
The article presents a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) for comparing two high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it requires tuning a hyperparameter (α) resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Additionally, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. The authors develop gcPCA, a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. gcPCA uses a normalization factor to mitigate the bias toward high-variance dimensions, eliminating the need for the α hyperparameter. The authors provide an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. They demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. gcPCA is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method that provides a valuable resource for analyzing diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.
The study presents a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The model reveals feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of this crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. The trained network for BL-2 cells was found to be transferable to BL-41 cells, and the BL-2 network was also suitable for modeling BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling. This suggests that BCR aberration does not cause major downstream rewiring. The study also found that the BL-2-derived network structure forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in DLBCL cell lines. Despite the discovery of feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling, no cellular dependency was found in the cell lines studied. However, these signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types, suggesting that insights from this study may apply to other B cell lymphomas. The study also identified three novel connections that significantly improved the model fit, including a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70, and a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK.
The Notch receptor signalling network plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance, with its activity regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular transactivation and intracellular cis inhibition. Notch ligands, such as DLL4 and JAG1, interact with receptors to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signalling. This study explores the molecular basis of the opposing actions of DLL4 and JAG1 in controlling angiogenic sprouting. Using a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, the authors provide evidence for two mechanisms underlying this process: DLL4 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation, while JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. The study proposes a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The results suggest that a heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complex, formed when the ligands are expressed in the same cell, relieves Notch1 receptor cis-inhibition and enables efficient Notch1 receptor signalling. The study also reveals that DLL4 homodimers, but not DLL4-JAG1 heterodimers, mediate Notch1 receptor cis-inhibition. A new theoretical model of DLL4/JAG1-Notch-VEGF signalling is proposed, incorporating the novel finding that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes.
The article presents Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. The authors demonstrate that DPMUnc outperforms existing methods on simulated data and apply it to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc successfully separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. The authors also propose a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. This procedure is applied to three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. The results show association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work lies in demonstrating that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering, and presenting a method that does this, DPMUnc. Additionally, the authors show the value of using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined, by summarizing gene expression data from patients with IMD using relevant gene signatures and clustering these patients using DPMUnc.
Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling the primate visual system, but they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. This is because they rely more heavily on features such as color and texture rather than shape. To investigate this issue, the authors designed artificial image datasets where shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. They trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations and found that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, while others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision. The authors propose that enabling deep networks to recognize shapes will likely require changes to the learning algorithm rather than network architecture. They demonstrate that the color- and texture-bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning, specifically from the way that gradients for color and texture features align with image classes. They show that reducing the alignment between color- and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape-based classification.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary source of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver, and their overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic liver diseases. To understand the dynamics of HSCs and develop new therapeutic approaches, the authors developed rule-based models using the Kappa graph rewriting language to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. The models describe HSCs as agents with seven physiological cellular states that interact with TGFβ1 molecules, which regulate HSC activation and type I collagen secretion. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation in fibrosis progression and reversion, and the accumulation of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) during chronic liver disease. The authors validated the predicted ECM dynamics using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis and confirmed the accumulation of iHSCs in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis. The study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease, which can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. The model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues. The study demonstrates the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches and highlights the importance of iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression.
A novel meta-analysis framework has been developed to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators in large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program. This framework leverages the asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation and requires only summary statistics, allowing for inter-study heterogeneity. The proposed method can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic profiling platforms. Extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. The method was applied to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The results showed that the total mediation effect of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in HDL cholesterol was significant. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub. This framework addresses the unmet need in the emergence of large-scale genomic profiling and provides a novel approach to estimate the total mediation effect in high-dimensional settings.
Cancer development is driven by a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage to cells, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. Identifying these driver genes is crucial for designing effective cancer treatments. However, existing computational methods have limitations, as they often provide a single driver gene list for an entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. To address this issue, a novel method called PDRWH was proposed to prioritize mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients sharing co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles. PDRWH was tested on 16 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and outperformed existing individual-level and cohort-level methods in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. The method also demonstrated the ability to identify both common and rare drivers. Personalized driver profiles generated by PDRWH could improve tumor stratification and provide new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity. One predicted novel driver gene, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ), was validated to promote tumor cell proliferation in vitro. The PDRWH method integrates genome and transcriptome analysis to identify candidate personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across cohort samples. It has the potential to assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment.
The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) is a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. The VEP generates spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. To improve the effectiveness of VEP models, a global optimization approach was developed using the SaCeSS algorithm, a cooperative metaheuristic capable of parallel computation. This approach yielded high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. The VEP models were benchmarked on synthetic data, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance compared to other parallel solvers. A Bayesian optimization framework was used for hyperparameter tuning, resulting in significant gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. This study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby informing clinical decision-making. The VEP is a model-based approach that relies on estimating parameters in a high-dimensional state-space representation to accurately identify the network of epileptogenic zones (EZ/PZ) in the brain. By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, the VEP offers a versatile platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid in clinical decision-making.
The study investigated the dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replication and death in rabbit lungs using a novel, virulent clinical isolate, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In vitro experiments showed that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 than in the commonly used laboratory-adapted strain H37Rv. However, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in rabbit lungs did not follow a monotonic decline; instead, the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection, despite a large increase in bacterial numbers. Mathematical modeling suggested that this non-monotonic change can be explained by the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication and death kinetics. One major population expanded early and was controlled or eliminated, while a smaller population expanded at later times, causing an increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. The study also found that HN878-pBP10 undergoes a larger number of replications than H37Rv in mice, highlighting differences between Mtb strains and host species. The results suggest that Mtb dynamics in rabbits may be more complex than previously thought, with independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of granulomas. The study provides new insights into Mtb growth dynamics in TB granulomas and opens avenues for future research, including correlating estimated replication and death rates with immune response components in individual granulomas.
The development of a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, has been reported. This algorithm computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations. GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths and demonstrated high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. The algorithm was also used to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work aims to inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement. The GlycanTreeModeler and associated tools allow modelers to accurately model glycans of interest through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm and energy function were rigorously optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity at a median de novo root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) of 2. 7 angstroms. The results show that GlycanTreeModeler can accurately predict glycan structures de novo, build them into known density, and be used in SugarCoating protein surfaces.
The study identifies a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, in Penicillium oxalicum, a filamentous fungus. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex, specifically the F-box protein PoFbx23, directly recognizes and activates the transcription factor PoAce1 within the nucleus. PoAce1 is a ubiquitinated protein that negatively regulates the transcription of (hemi)cellulase genes in various fungi. However, in the absence of PoFbx23, the transcription levels of (hemi)cellulase genes are significantly upregulated. The study reveals that PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing it to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects under different signals. PoFbx23 is present in the nucleus in three different states: most of the protein is free, a small portion associates with Skp1 to form a heterodimer, and a small portion assembles with the SCF complex. The deletion of the Pofbx23 gene results in the accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein, which is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds to promoters of target genes. The study proposes a model of PoFbx23-Ace1 regulating gene transcription, where PoFbx23 recognizes and activates PoAce1, allowing it to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects under different signals. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression in P. oxalicum.
The basement membrane (BM) is a crucial structural component of tissues that plays a significant role in organ morphogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation and diversification are not well understood. In Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium, the BM is composed of oriented BM fibrils and a homogenous matrix. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. The authors found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion, with Rab10 promoting lateral and planar-polarized secretion and Rab8 promoting basal secretion. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and Rab10 were found to be present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. The exocyst complex was also found to have a dual function, interacting with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization and being required for the Rab8 route. The results suggest that the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes is the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development. This study provides new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrates that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites.
The development of machine learning models to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) has the potential to increase the therapeutic benefits of bnAb therapy. However, current models face two main challenges: underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets, which affects their generalizability, and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance. To address these challenges, researchers have employed multi-task learning (MTL), a strategy that trains models using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once. A new model, called the Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), was developed using MTL to predict HIV-1 resistance to different bnAbs. The LBUM was pre-trained on Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned on sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. The results show that MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and allow the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies. This enables the prediction of antibodies’ epitopes and the selection of optimal bnAb combinations. The LBUM outperformed classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 bnAbs. The study demonstrates the potential of MTL to address key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research and can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy. The LBUM is publicly available at https://github.com/iaime/LBUM.
The present study aimed to develop prognostic models for multiple myeloma (MM) that incorporate pathway information to improve therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, neglecting the role of pathway dysfunction in disease development and progression. The study employed two strategies: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The pathway score method converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting, using three methods (ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. The group lasso method selected a subset of pathways to include in the model. The study implemented these methods in microarray data for MM (GSE136324) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in internal validation. The candidate model, which incorporated Vax pathway information (Vax(grp)), outperformed the gene-based model and previously published models in both internal and external validation. The study also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction and found that the new model was more resistant to missing values. The results suggest that pathway-based models, particularly those incorporating immune-related pathways, are competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM. The study's computational workflow and R package (https://github.com/ShuoStat/MMMs) provide a comprehensive guide for future studies incorporating prior knowledge into predictive models.
A nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin-related protein one (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission was developed to identify parameters regulating the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. The TFR, defined from a nondimensionalization of the model, undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k+Mk-, where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and k+ and k- are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable μ represents the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. The cumulative total fission (TF), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one dimensionless parameter, μ. The TF does not monotonically increase with μ, instead, it increases to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting k+, k-, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist in future therapeutic target selection. The model identifies μ as a key regulatory parameter for Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, which is the process of a mitochondrion dividing into two daughter organelles. The model focuses on Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission following cellular injury when the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol is increased.
The study presents a CRISPR-based gene drive system targeting the Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) gene in Drosophila suzukii, a significant fruit pest, and Drosophila melanogaster, a model insect. The system employs three guide RNAs (gRNAs) to induce nonfunctional mutations in the Tdc2 gene, aiming to mitigate the development of resistance alleles. However, the homing efficiency in the germline was found to be low, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, facilitating easier line maintenance. The study also demonstrated the effectiveness of a similar system in D. melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. The results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect significantly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. The findings have significant implications for the control of disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests, and the use of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drives is shown to be a promising approach for population suppression.
The article explores the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks and proposes two plasticity-restricting algorithms to save energy. The authors argue that the brain has evolved to learn using as little energy as possible, given the significant metabolic cost of synaptic updates. They introduce an abstract energy measure that assumes energy is solely used by synaptic updates and find an approximate square root relation between energy and network size. The results show that large, over-dimensioned networks learn faster but use more energy, suggesting that restricting plasticity might save energy. The authors propose two algorithms: 1) only modifying synapses with large updates, and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. These algorithms are shown to save energy while incurring only a slightly worse learning time. The authors suggest that these findings might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. The results also have implications for hardware design, as electronic memory storage is energetically costly. Future studies could include adapting the saving algorithms to task difficulty or network architecture, and finding the most energy-efficient synaptic modification during transfer learning. The energy model can be refined as more experimental data becomes available, and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms can be re-examined.
The study investigated the effects of genome streamlining on the fitness of Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx and the ability of laboratory evolution to recover lost fitness. Six variants of ADP1-ISx with deletions of 22- to 42-kilobase regions and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases were evolved in chemically defined minimal medium or complex medium for approximately 300 generations. Genome sequencing of endpoint clonal isolates revealed that fitness increased in all cases except for two ancestors that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, although the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensated for an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains that restored csrA function. The results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. Overall, the study validates laboratory evolution as a strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains and illuminates a path forward for engineering a minimal-genome A. baylyi strain.
The study presents a novel self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. The T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme was inserted into the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, resulting in a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. The ribozyme displayed superior activity compared to other ribozymes, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression. A base-editing strategy was used to inactivate the ribozyme, demonstrating its reversibility and specificity. Furthermore, a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, was generated to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Additionally, a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter was integrated into the RiboFlip cassette to label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. The RiboFlip cassette was shown to be a flexible tool for controlling endogenous gene expression in zebrafish, offering an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. The study demonstrates the potential of self-cleaving ribozymes to modulate endogenous gene expression in vertebrates, expanding the genetic toolbox available for functional genomics in vertebrates.
A new software tool, aiSEGcell, has been developed to segment nuclei and cells in bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the requirement for transgenic or dye labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. aiSEGcell utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cellular structures in BF images, which can be challenging in low-magnification and time-lapse imaging conditions. The software is user-friendly, accessible through both command line and graphical user interface, and does not require expert coding experience. It is also adaptable to new use cases, requiring only 32 images for retraining. aiSEGcell has been extensively evaluated for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from various imaging modalities, including hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. The software accurately segments nuclei from even challenging BF images, retaining biologically relevant information, such as for quantifying noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. The authors provide a curated ground-truth data set with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images to support the development and evaluation of aiSEGcell. This software has the potential to improve experimental workflows by enabling the use of additional fluorescent markers and reducing the need for fluorescent labeling.
In two experiments and one preregistered replication, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. The results showed that participants accrued more reward when a bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. The ability to generalize to unseen feature values did not differ between conditions. Using a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models, it was found that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits was positively correlated with the adjustment of their learning rates. These findings provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favors slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. The results are consistent with the idea that humans employ a "slowness prior" to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning, which aids in learning task states. The learning rates for the relevant features mediated the behavioral effect, indicating that the observed differences between conditions were driven by increased learning from the slow feature and decreased learning from the fast feature.
The study identifies Resf1 as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER-negative breast cancer. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, researchers previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility, and this study extends those findings to Resf1. Resf1 is a poorly characterized gene that encodes a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure but poor amino acid conservation. Mouse models demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. An analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, suggesting that Resf1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER-negative breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control. The study provides evidence that Resf1 is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer, and its loss may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis.
During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11, which activates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader Rad24RAD17. To investigate the genome-wide roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination, the authors utilised two strategies: deletion of the mismatch repair protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor. Genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny revealed that deletion of RAD24 resulted in severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in recombination frequency, driven by a shortened prophase. In contrast, loss of Mec1 function increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also play important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ), with CO distributions becoming more random upon loss of either protein. The results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, with the loss of Mec1 helping to suppress broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR.
Pneumocystis jirovecii is a deadly fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite its significant impact on human health, limited progress has been made in understanding its pathobiology due to the inability to culture the organism in vitro. To address this challenge, a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism was developed to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. The model was constructed using recently published genome data and available information in the literature, as well as bioinformatics and software tools. Relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches were employed to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. The findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and offer a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro. The model was validated by replicating drop-off and gene knockout experiments, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets. Additionally, the model was used to identify critical components of Merali’s growth medium and suggest how to supplement it to enhance Pneumocystis growth. A genome-scale metabolic model for the mouse-specific fungal pathogen, Pneumocystis murina, was also developed for practical and ethical reasons. These findings open new opportunities to release the major experimental bottleneck in Pneumocystis research.
The Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation. At low cell density, YAP/TAZ induces cell proliferation by localizing to the nucleus. However, at high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated, leading to YAP/TAZ translocation to the cytoplasm and cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells exhibit increased YAP/TAZ levels compared to normal cells, but it remains unclear whether this increase is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition. To investigate this, a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model was constructed to simulate cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. The model accounted for cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations with adhesion and repulsive forces between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. Simulations were performed at various YAP/TAZ levels to determine the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results showed that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest and enable continuous proliferation under high-density conditions. This model may be applied to evaluate cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, develop drugs to suppress abnormal cancer cell proliferation, and determine appropriate drug dosages. The model integrates cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the influence of cell density and YAP/TAZ concentration on proliferation.
The study presents an energy landscape framework for understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of low-complexity domains (LCDs) governs the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates. The framework operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale, rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence, and characterizes sequences by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Using this framework, the study maps diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. The results reveal that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. The energy landscape framework also explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through sticker periodicity and strength variations. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, advancing our understanding of their dynamics and functional roles. The study addresses a critical gap in the field by elucidating the role of sequence complexity in governing the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates.
The development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme. Signaling by secreted molecules, including Shh, is crucial for epithelial morphogenesis, but the mechanisms by which this information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes are not fully understood. Using the mouse dentition as a model, researchers investigated the role of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in dental epithelial invagination. They found that MyoII is essential for this process and functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing MyoII activation via the AKT pathway. Pharmacological induction of AKT and MyoII can rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh, supporting a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through MyoII to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. MyoII acts at multiple levels to generate cellular forces and maintain robust intercellular adhesion, and its perturbations impede the convergent extension-driven narrowing of the dental cord and invagination. The results demonstrate the importance of MyoII in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium, consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis promotes proper cell-cell adhesion and cell movement to propel incisor invagination.
The rapid advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) has enabled the exploration of complex biological mechanisms at the single-cell level. However, current methods for transferring labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data have limited performance due to their inability to preserve fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. To address this challenge, a novel deep transfer model called scTGCN (single-cell Transfer Graph Convolutional Network) has been proposed. scTGCN leverages graph convolutional networks to integrate and analyze large-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data, enabling the combination of different types of measurements, even if the data is unpaired. The model formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships and gene expression using graph convolutional networks, which are based on the kinetic relationships between the specific regulatory mechanisms of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. scTGCN achieves high label transfer accuracy and effectively transfers knowledge across different modalities, including mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Furthermore, scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Overall, scTGCN is a robust and versatile transfer learning approach that enables the integration and analysis of larger-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data.
The study characterizes the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) modeling, the researchers demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. The study identifies specific basic residues within Mcm3’s NLS that are critical for its function, including P2 and P3, which mediate interactions with importin alpha. Mutations of Mcm3 at P2 or P3 result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth. The researchers also utilize AF3 to model the interaction between importin alpha and Mcm3’s NLS variants, demonstrating that the NLSs of Mcm3 and SV40 share similar contacts with Kap60. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. Further characterization of Mcm3’s NLS will help elucidate its cell cycle-dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, and refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins.
Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), and Parkinsonism. The protein encoded by ATXN2 has been identified as a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. Research has shown that ATXN2 can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). The LSm domain of ATXN2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mRNP-granule assembly. This study further investigates the role of ATXN2 in mRNA translation and mRNP assembly using Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results from Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ), co-localization, and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the PAM2 motif of ATXN2, which interacts with polyA-binding protein ( PABP ), is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of ATXN2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila suggest that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both contribute to Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. The study proposes a model for how ATXN2 interactions are remodeled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.
This study investigated the role of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in extraocular muscles (EOMs) and limb muscles. The researchers used genetically modified mice to examine the spatiotemporal functional roles of Pitx2 and Pax7 in myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages. They found that Pitx2 is dispensable for MuSC specification and maintenance in EOMs, despite being a major upstream regulator during early development. In contrast, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in EOMs compared to limb muscles. The study proposes a relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. Additionally, MuSCs in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult. However, EOMs have a higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and postnatally. In the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. The study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterization of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and sheds light on the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy.
The study proposes a novel algorithm called VOCs-informed neural network (VOCs-INN) to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. The algorithm integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOCs-INN emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting. The algorithm combines the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks (PINNs) to capture the time-varying nature of parameters. The study demonstrates that VOCs-INN can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia province and its five internal health agencies in Canada, as well as simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data. The study concludes that the integration of PINNs with infectious disease models, particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach, represents a significant research contribution. VOCs-INN leverages available observational data and the underlying physical principles governing infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters. The algorithm has the potential to be integrated with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data.
The article introduces CytoSummaryNet, a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction in image-based cell profiling by 30–68% compared to average profiling. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework to aggregate single-cell feature data. The model learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological feature input data and providing the aggregated profile as an output. CytoSummaryNet achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. The model offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet is an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies and the average profiling baseline. The model likely achieves this by performing quality control, filtering out noisy cells. CytoSummaryNet is a self-supervised contrastive learning approach that leverages naturally available information in profiling experiments. It applies contrastive learning to already-extracted single-cell features, making it immediately applicable to most image-based profiling datasets. The model treats the data as a collection of sets of cells, where each sample corresponds to one set, and employs the Deep Sets formulation to learn a model that aggregates single-cell feature data into a profile that outperforms population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound’s mechanism of action. Future research could explore CytoSummaryNet’s applicability to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics.
This study proposes a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory to associate cognitive effort with neural data. To validate the framework, the researchers applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The results revealed an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. This study contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics and transition costs in cognitive processes, offering insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance. A stochastic control framework was employed to measure the brain transition cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and cognitive demand observed during the spatial Stroop task. This approach provides a computational pipeline to quantify cognitive demand in EEG experiments, bridging a gap in the field by generalizing the method to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study highlights the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes.
This study investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aMBCs) in the humoral immune response to Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria. P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPII) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. The results showed that PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness and persisted through the recovery phase of infections. Single MBC cultures were used to demonstrate the function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. The B cell receptors (BCRs) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different. These findings suggest that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs, which may play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. The study highlights the potential of aMBCs in humoral immune response to malaria and may facilitate the development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines.
The article introduces mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that enables polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes using summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. Unlike mr. mash, which requires individual-level data, mr. mash-rss is computationally efficient and scalable to biobank-size data. The authors demonstrate that mr. mash-rss is competitive with and often outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios through simulations. They also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has a smaller sample size. The results indicate that mr. mash-rss is robust to a small to medium amount of missing phenotypes and can be efficiently fitted in specific cases with complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes. The authors conclude that mr. mash-rss addresses the limitations of mr. mash, including the need for individual-level data and the lack of scalability to biobank-size data, making it a valuable tool for polygenic prediction in human genetics.
The study proposes a novel modelling framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model. The UDE model is trained using deep learning methods with data from a COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, while a mechanistic model is calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods. The study projects the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. The results indicate an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80. 06% and 3. 17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model’s projections of 99. 97% and 32. 78%. This represents an 18. 6% improvement in prediction accuracy based on actual data. The study also demonstrates that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37. 36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days. The proposed framework provides a new class of models and insights for modelling heterogeneity in epidemics. By incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the classical homogeneous model, the study accurately depicts the epidemic curve of the first large-scale outbreak of the Omicron variant in China, including peak size, final size, herd immunity, and outbreak duration. The prediction accuracy is significantly enhanced compared to the homogeneous model.
The article proposes that synapses in the brain use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework is developed to show that synapses interact with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. The approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Each synapse strives to predict the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, but the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. This enables synapses to coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations. The model predicts that synapses should be stochastic to effectively encode uncertainties about the somatic membrane potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity changes in post-pre-post spike pairing protocols. A synaptic learning rule is derived by minimizing the surprise in individual synapses, enabling them to adapt their synaptic efficacy to best predict future postsynaptic spikes. The synaptic variability can also be exploited to reflect uncertainty in neural firing, with the postsynaptic neuron learning to fire according to Gaussian distributions of firing times with different spreads.
The article presents Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method that utilizes bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. The method is designed to address the challenges associated with single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm, achieving faster analysis times and better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The method’s robustness is demonstrated using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology. Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies have enabled detailed analyses of development and cell differentiation, and Scuphr leverages this data to reconstruct cell lineage trees with high resolution. The article highlights the importance of single-cell DNA sequencing in revealing more point mutations than other data types, but also notes the challenges associated with this data type, such as distinguishing somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification. Scuphr is designed to address these challenges and provide a more accurate and efficient method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. The method has the potential to contribute to studies of development, differentiation, and cancer progression.
The article presents a novel approach to evaluating health benefits packages (HBPs) in low-income settings, such as Malawi, using the individual-based epidemiological model Thanzi La Onse (TLO). The TLO model simulates the incidence of disease, health-seeking behavior, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health. The model is calibrated to extensive, country-specific data and used to evaluate the health gains achievable under different HBP strategies for Malawi. A linear constrained optimization analysis (LCOA) was used to identify the HBP that achieved the largest health gain, resulting in an approximately 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to a benchmark scenario. However, this HBP incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Alternative approaches to prioritization, such as service prioritization based on patient characteristics, were also assessed and found to achieve consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year-to-year basis, with a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period. The TLO simulation provides a unique tool for testing HBPs designed specifically for Malawi, allowing for detailed evaluations of the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritization of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health. The approach addresses limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions.
This study investigates the mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori. Using Oligopaint DNA FISH, the researchers found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. The study also reveals that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Sister kinetochores are not paired in these species, and four distinct kinetochores are observed at metaphase I. Clear end-on microtubule attachments are found to co-orient these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology. The results suggest that moths employ a novel "center-kinetic" segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome. This mechanism is distinct from the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in other organisms. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome dynamics in holocentric species.
The median eminence (ME), located at the base of the hypothalamus, plays a crucial role in the exchange of information between the brain and the pituitary gland. Research has shown that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, a condition characterized by the underproduction of hormones by the pituitary gland. This study aimed to investigate the role of SOX3 in the hypothalamus and the etiology of hypopituitarism. The results demonstrate that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME, leading to phenotypes that occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary gland, the reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. Furthermore, the study found that NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected in the ME. Low-dose aspirin treatment and changes in gut microbiota were found to rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. The study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals. The results suggest that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation, and that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors.
In C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis, the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 is an essential activator of F-actin. However, the Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor ( GEF ) that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations is unknown. The two-component GEF CED-5/CED-12 is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 during corpse engulfment and larval Distal Tip Cell migration, promoting F-actin formation. Surprisingly, CED-5/CED-12 was found to support embryonic migrations, but inhibit F-actin in the migrating epidermis. To address this paradox, it was investigated if CED-12 harbors GTPase Activating Protein ( GAP ) functions. A candidate GAP region in CED-12 was identified and mutated, resulting in altered epidermal cell migration function, but not corpse engulfment function. Interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10 also resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Genetic and expression studies suggest that CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases, using distinct domains to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. The GEF function of CED-5/CED-12 activates CED-10/Rac1 to promote branched actin for corpse engulfment, while a different GEF activates CED-10/Rac1 to regulate F-actin during embryonic epidermal cell migration. CED-5/DOCK-180 and CED-12/ELMO act as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during corpse engulfment, but the GEF for CED-10/Rac1 during ventral enclosure is unknown.
The study investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. The study also found that intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input was used to reproduce these observations. The results indicate that network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as an increase in recurrent coupling, are also important for shaping the temporal processing hierarchy. The study suggests that the rodent visual system uses a hierarchical organization of temporal processing to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. This is in contrast to previous evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system, which seemed to conflict with the hypothesis of a hierarchical organization of temporal processing.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, but the neural circuits engaged during TMS are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. The goal was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. The results showed that neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). The total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Additionally, multiple neuron type activations could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The findings support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The results also suggest that activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiate different I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.
The presence of cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) in maternal circulation during gestation has significant implications for research and clinical applications. CfpDNA is shed into maternal plasma throughout pregnancy, comprising up to 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA, and has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, including chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility.

CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta. The distinction between cell-free "fetal" DNA and cell-free "placental" DNA is crucial, particularly in cases of confined placental mosaicism where the fetal and placental genomes do not match. NIPT has been widely implemented to screen for common fetal aneuploidies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing for overrepresentation of the affected chromosomes in maternal plasma cell-free DNA.

The use of cfpDNA as a research tool has the potential to improve our understanding of placental physiological processes, the functional role of cfpDNA in pregnancy, and how cfpDNA can be leveraged to study and monitor placental health and disease. Longitudinal studies of placental development and disease are hindered by ethical constraints and limited availability of early- and mid-gestation tissue samples, but cfpDNA can provide a noninvasive means to overcome these limitations.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, has identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome. These regions are defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs, with two regions containing risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs, and 28 for two HDCs. The study integrated GWAS data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models to annotate 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. The study also pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factor motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Notably, known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDCs. The study provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility. The findings suggest that lncRNAs may play a significant role in HDC risk, and further research is needed to elucidate their mechanisms of action.
A genome-wide association study of polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog breed identified a region on chromosome CFA19 as significantly associated with the disease (p = 4.7*10−10). Haplotype analysis revealed that affected dogs shared a 2.9 Mb region in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment located 10 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0.81 in affected dogs and 0.25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes from affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. The study suggests that elements located 10-49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10-20% for homozygous dogs and 0.5-2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. The study also suggests that distant variants upstream of IL21 could be important for human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. A PCR assay was developed to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs, providing a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high-risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.
In this study, a protein language model named ESMtherm was developed and fine-tuned to predict the folding stability of proteins. The model was trained on a mega-scale dataset of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains, allowing it to accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. The results show that ESMtherm performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. However, its performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind state-of-the-art methods. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of mutagenesis studies of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction. The results also demonstrate the benefits of training collectively on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis studies on a single wildtype. ESMtherm was fine-tuned from ESM-2, a pre-existing protein language model, to act as an end-to-end stability predictor. The model performs comparably with state-of-the-art models and generalizes to small protein sequences distal to those of the training set. However, its performance on larger proteins is limited due to its training on sequences no longer than 72 residues in length. To address this limitation, the study benchmarks ESMtherm on seven stability-related datasets on larger proteins and compares its results with state-of-the-art methods.
The study investigated the role of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ). iKIRs are a family of receptors expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells that regulate T cell-mediated immunity. The researchers hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response is detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect compared to their role in chronic viral infections. They conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. The results were validated in an independent dataset. The study suggests that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D by decreasing HLA class II protective associations. This is in contrast to their role in chronic viral infections, where iKIRs enhance protective and detrimental HLA associations. The researchers propose that iKIRs modulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D, which may have implications for understanding the etiopathogenesis of the disease. The study highlights the potential role of iKIRs in regulating T cell responses in autoimmunity and suggests that further research is needed to explore this interaction in other autoimmune diseases.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans. The majority of European FECD cases are attributed to the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element (CTG18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. However, the non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. This study aimed to comprehensively describe the CTG18.1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs) from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18.1-expanded (Exp+) and CTG18.1-independent (Exp-) FECD. The researchers employed long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. The results revealed the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD and unique transcripts associated with CTG18.1 expansions. Additionally, differential gene expression analysis highlighted the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. The study also identified rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in 7/134 Exp- FECD cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18.1 may increase FECD risk. The findings support the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of FECD.
The genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LTG) in rice (Oryza sativa) was investigated to improve direct seeding in cold climates. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) named qLTG11 was identified in the Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra, which exhibits rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. Using QTL-seq, the candidate region was narrowed down to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz da Terra allele of GF14h encodes a functional protein, whereas the Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. A NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra, including GF14h, showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) contains an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). To investigate the structure of HBV rcDNA and covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. The 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. RACE-NGS analyses mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA. The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor. These findings contribute to our understanding of HBV replication cycle.
The efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in industrial wastewater treatment is influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. A microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) was developed to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Simulations revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates (OLRs) increased, accompanied by a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs and adaptation to high OLRs. The simulations showed constraints on SOB growth under high OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. Cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.
Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. To address this issue, a new framework called CPEC is proposed, which integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction. CPEC provides accurate and false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model, ensuring that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. CPEC is expected to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. The framework is demonstrated using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance, tailored to the experiment budget or goals, and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR.
The study investigated the role of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of familial ALS (fALS) caused by mutations in the TARDBP gene, which codes for the protein TDP-43. TDP-43 inclusions are a hallmark of ALS, and mutations in TARDBP can cause some cases of fALS. The study found that loss of function of Hsp90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. The study also found that Hsp90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress-responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16.1, and that normal levels of hsp-16.1 are required for Hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of Hsp90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. The results suggest that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo. The study provides evidence that Hsp90 inhibition can be neuroprotective in ALS, facilitating the clearance of TDP-43 by releasing the transcription factor HSF-1, which activates the heat shock response.
The study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. This atlas reveals the major cell types present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. By mapping the data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, the study sheds light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. The results show that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved despite ~505 million years of evolutionary divergence. The study identifies clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns in the Artemia ovary, which share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters. This suggests that the molecular pathways that define cellular identity in the ovary are conserved across species. The study also explores the unique regulatory programs and chromatin accessibility in the different cell types of the Artemia female reproductive system. Additionally, the study investigates the gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis in germ cells, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system, and highlights the utility of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a tool for studying meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells.
Chronic pain is a debilitating and costly condition, with allodynia being a common symptom where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses. The mechanisms behind allodynia are unclear, but it is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This study analyzes biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, which are hypothesized to mediate static and dynamic allodynia. The study uses neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, the study specifies model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. A sensitivity analysis approach is then used to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. The results suggest that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory neuron responses, which can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. The study provides specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be responsible for allodynia, offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.
This study investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in regulating the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a protein essential for ribosome translocation during translation. The results show that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in mediating eEF2 function: one group of Hsp90 mutations and cochaperone mutations reduced steady-state levels of eEF2, while another group altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dependent on a unique post-translational modification on eEF2. The study also found that yeast expressing Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation were negatively impacted by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1, a cochaperone that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with Hsp90 and the TRiC chaperone. Furthermore, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1, and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1. These findings suggest that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. The study also provides evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones, suggesting that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients.
The study investigated how individuals make risky decisions in social contexts when their utility-based risk processing is disrupted or inaccessible. Participants with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices. The results showed that these participants exhibited disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. However, when making socially situated decisions, they showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Furthermore, the study found a parametric relationship between the degree of impairment in utility-based risky decision-making and the use of the ‘follow others’ choices’ heuristic. Specifically, individuals whose utility-based risky decision-making was most disrupted conformed the most with the choices of others. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample of control participants, providing convergent evidence supporting the notion that there is a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively less demanding heuristics that facilitates decisions about risky options in a social context.
The article explores the concept of biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution introduced by Richard Dawkins, to demonstrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. Contrary to the traditional view that biomorphs illustrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations, the study reveals that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes are significantly more likely to appear through random mutations. This bias is characterized by a preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. An information-theoretic principle formalizes this bias, which can be intuitively understood as evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. Using population genetics simulations, the study shows that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. The study also finds patterns in the structure of variation for biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, which resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. These patterns are explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. The study postulates that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns observed in biomorphs may hold more widely for developmental systems.
The study aimed to investigate whether humans can intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that nonlinear systems prefer intrinsically. A numerical mode tool was used to compute the nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) of energy-conservative systems, which are periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. In a user study, participants commanded virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick to alternately hit two targets. The targets were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ). The results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. This was observed in all tested experiment variations, including increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ). Participants were able to successfully accomplish the task by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. The study provides data-based evidence that humans can apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. The findings extend existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems and suggest that humans can intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that nonlinear systems prefer intrinsically.
In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, two transition state regulators (TSRs), ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, play a crucial role in regulating the production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin. During the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase, TSRs influence various developmental processes, including biofilm formation, genetic competence, and sporulation. This study demonstrates that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR collectively limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. The expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC is under the control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR, and is correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced. Biochemical analysis shows that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating tight regulation of pulcherrimin production. The results suggest that PchR and AbrB act as roadblocks to RNA polymerase progression at the yvmC promoter, while ScoC has a weak direct regulatory role and may also have indirect regulation through another factor. The presence of all three repressors is necessary to limit pulcherrimin production, providing insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in bacteria. This study highlights the importance of pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology and demonstrates the complex regulation of gene expression in response to nutrient limitation.
Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can lead to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, resulting from the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, urethral sphincters, and pelvic floor muscles. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI has been shown to reduce DSD and incontinence. A mathematical model was developed to replicate the neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after SCI and the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS. The model, based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations, simulated normal bladder function and then added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI. The model was able to replicate the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI and the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity observed with TMS. Low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. The model suggests that neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition and that both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms of TMS in reducing bladder dysfunction after SCI. The study provides a framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and the effects of TMS as a therapeutic intervention.
The article presents a mathematical model for estimating morphology-specific fungal growth rates from optical density (OD600) data, which is an indirect measure of fungal growth. Current methods for quantifying fungal growth rely on time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length, which can be challenging to collect in clinical microbiology laboratories. The proposed model treats OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration, explicitly accounting for the indirect nature of OD600 measurements. This approach eliminates the need for calibration data, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data. The model was evaluated using time-course OD600 data for Aspergillus fumigatus, a filamentous fungus, and was found to outperform reference models in fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves. The estimated morphology-specific growth rates from the proposed model were also found to be more accurate than those obtained from directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration. The study demonstrates the potential of the model to provide biologically interpretable and morphology-specific fungal growth rates without the need for calibration data, making it a valuable tool for clinical microbiology laboratories.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, but some groups exhibiting X0 sex determination mechanisms. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, was generated, and eleven additional beetle genomes were used to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, were identified, which share a conserved set of genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, but independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes were found. These neo-sex chromosomes evolved the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. Beetles provide a novel model to study the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. A broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles suggests that they will be a promising model to study patterns of karyotype evolution and evolutionary forces operating on sex chromosomes. The ancestral X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple independent formations of neo-sex chromosomes were identified, even among closely related beetle species. Comparative analysis is needed to address the prevalence of these patterns and the evolutionary forces driving them across species. A new chromosome-level assembly for Tribolium confusum and published assemblies from eleven additional species were used to broadly reconstruct sex chromosome and karyotype evolution in beetles.
This study investigated the role of H2A. Z, a histone variant encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, in gene expression regulation. H2A. Z is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ) and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. The growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, suggesting that previous work examining the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ). The study generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. The results showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. The study also found that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. The study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A. Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU.
The article discusses the challenge of classifying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data into various cell types and identifying lineage relationships using automated methods. Due to the high dimensionality of the data and the difficulty of obtaining fully annotated datasets, classical supervised learning approaches are insufficient. The authors propose using partial label learning, where a set of candidate labels is provided for each sample, with only one correct label. This approach is more feasible than fully supervised learning, which requires a single correct label per sample. The authors extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, including SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression, and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. They also investigate the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods, particularly the hierarchical structure observed in developmental processes. The results show that these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and achieve high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. The performances of the methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same level as those trained with fully supervised data. The authors also study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data and its effect on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential of hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies for automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.
The study investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets (NLIs). PIP2 was found to be involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription and its nuclear localization was shown to be dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. Using mass spectrometry, the study identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated (RDPA) nuclear proteome in human cells, revealing that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. These IDRs exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study also found that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. The results suggest that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins, affecting their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. The study proposes that PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge via RNA association to attract and retain different sets of RDPA proteins, thereby playing a pivotal role in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.
This study investigates the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, a species-rich clade of insects characterized by highly diversified nutrition-responsive development. The researchers generated chromosome-level genome assemblies for three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini, including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella, and compared them to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera. The analysis identified evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. The study also contrasted chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females, revealing distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development. The results highlight the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, and demonstrate that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. The study provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. The research also identifies sequence gains and changes associated with adaptations unique to dung beetle ecology and evolution, and sheds light on the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation.
The pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus ( LASV ), remains poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the variable outcomes of LASV infection, researchers used a cynomolgus monkey model to study the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune response associated with survival or death. The study found that lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies significantly with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. In contrast, systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, accompanied by macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These findings provide new insights into the early viral dynamics and host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome. The study also highlights the importance of animal models in understanding the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms underlying the different outcomes of the disease. The results suggest that the replication of LASV in secondary lymphoid organs is a critical step in the development of Lassa fever, and that the severity of the disease is influenced by the extent of viral dissemination and the host immune response.
The study investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTD/FTLD), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The researchers found that pathological disruption of NCT, including the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, is a common feature of these diseases. However, the question of whether these alterations are a primary cause or a downstream consequence of disease remained unclear. To address this, the study used two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration (NemfR86S and NemfR487G) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. The results showed an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block, cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, and similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induced key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in the mouse models and in neurodegeneration. The study provides mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin-β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function.
The study presents a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas-based phage mutagenesis by temporarily reducing DNA modifications in lytic bacteriophages. The researchers utilized the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to decrease the abundance of 5-methylcytosine in the phage T4 genome, allowing for the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas. This resulted in the facilitated introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. The study demonstrated that DNA modifications protect the phage genome from nucleolytic cleavage by Cas12, enabling efficient phage lysis. By analyzing the lysis of NgTET-treated T4 phages in E. coli expressing CRISPR-Cas12_Alt, the researchers observed a delay in lysis compared to infection with wild-type T4 phages. The findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into the genomes of lytic phages with cytosine-based DNA modifications. This approach enables the precise study of the impact of introduced mutations on phage infection without the side effects associated with gene deletion or reporter gene insertion. The study provides a valuable tool for the investigation of phage epigenome functions and the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications.
The genome of living cells is constantly exposed to DNA lesions that can interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. To maintain genome stability, cells employ various mechanisms to repair DNA damage, including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ). Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide, pose a significant threat to cell metabolism and are handled by TC-NER when located on the transcribed strand of active genes. Using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers identified histone variant H2A. Z as a crucial component in safeguarding transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A. Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. The study highlights the significance of DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability. H2A. Z is required for efficient TC-NER and contributes to the prevention of UV-induced double-strand breaks. The findings suggest that histone variant H2A. Z plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of TC-NER and the importance of chromatin environment in DNA repair.
The study analyzed gene expression and microbiome composition in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule of four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. The results showed extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects on gene expression and microbiome composition. Tissue-specific effects were stronger than genetic background-specific effects, but the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than in genes with conserved expression. However, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence. The study also found that the genetic basis of expression variation and the mode of expression inheritance were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific. The results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds, highlighting the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, and the effects of genetic background on expression and microbiome variation.
The article presents a population dynamics-based approach to estimate the delay from the first SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded. The authors validate their framework using simulated data and apply it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019. The model estimates the median number of days between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded to be 52 days, with a 95% interpercentile range of 41-78 days. The estimated date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is November 28, 2019, with a 95% interpercentile range of November 2-December 9, 2019. This estimate falls within the range previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. The population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, allowing it to be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19. The authors note that their approach is novel in using exclusively a population-dynamics approach, unlike previous studies that aimed to date the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results suggest that emerging epidemics may remain undetected for a significant period before detecting the first cases, which is particularly important for emergent pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.
The pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is crucial for the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells. However, the mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive. An agent-based model has been developed to simulate the dynamics of chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase I in budding yeast. The model takes into account both attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between non-homologous chromosomes. Simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play once distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A repulsive force that shortens the time spent in non-homologous interactions is a key feature of the pairing model, representing molecular processes that dissociate non-homologous chromosomes from each other. The model allows for the analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of various chromosomal parameters, including chromosome number, size, and movement velocity as well as attractive and repulsive forces, provide insights into the contributions of each of these factors to homolog pairing. The model accurately recapitulates the efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms.
This study investigated the role of microRNA miR-34a in the context of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. The results show that miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene, and its loss promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. However, miR-34a triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development. In zebrafish, miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes are primarily dependent on p53 for induction under DNA damage conditions and partially dependent on p53 for their baseline expression. The study also found that miR-34a has small but significant transcriptomic effects in zebrafish embryos under both control and DNA damage conditions. Furthermore, the loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. The study also demonstrated that miR-34a has tumor-suppressive functions, as evidenced by the earlier tumor onset in compound miR-34a and tp53 mutants compared to single tp53 mutants. These findings suggest that miR-34a plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and tumor development, and its dysregulation may contribute to cancer progression.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed, while in hermaphrodites, it is expressed at very low levels. Previous studies have suggested that xol-1 plays a critical role in male development, but its low expression in hermaphrodites was thought to be of minimal importance. However, this study reveals that xol-1 also regulates developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, researchers found that hermaphrodite embryos with a loss of xol-1 exhibit an accelerated rate of cell division and a more advanced transcriptional program. Further analysis revealed that xol-1 regulates the timing of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. The study also found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape, which can be reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that xol-1 plays a crucial role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that met-2 acts as a downstream effector of xol-1 activity in hermaphrodites.
A computational framework called MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE) has been developed to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. The framework aims to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest, such as gene drive mosquitoes or insecticide-resistant alleles. MGSurvE takes into account important biological features of mosquitoes and their habitats, including resource distribution, mosquito movement patterns, and trap attractiveness profiles. The framework can be applied to various mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae.

    MGSurvE was tested on two case studies: an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. The results showed that MGSurvE can effectively optimize trap placement to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest. For example, in the São Tomé case study, MGSurvE was used to distribute traps to detect an allele of interest for Anopheles coluzzii populations on the island.

    MGSurvE is a useful tool for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. The framework can be used to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations, which is critical for detecting unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes and insecticide-resistant alleles. By minimizing the time to detection, MGSurvE can help preserve the possibility of local elimination and maximize the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs.
Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a 1.4 μm heterotrophic microbial eukaryote characterized by the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, the identity and functional association of these endosymbionts were unknown. To investigate this, amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data were generated from two strains of S. scintillans, RCC257 and RCC24. Contrary to expectations, no sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria were detected. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses further confirmed the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs in the assemblies from both strains were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla. A near-complete 190 kbp draft genome of a prasinovirus, BpV, was assembled, and two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257 and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24 were identified, collectively referred to as SsVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar in morphology and size to the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. These findings suggest that S. scintillans does not harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium but is instead associated with giant viruses.
The leiomodin (Lmod) family of actin-binding proteins plays a crucial role in muscle function, with mutations in all three family members (LMOD1-3) resulting in human myopathies. Specifically, mutations in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or frameshift mutations, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. The authors investigated the underlying mechanism of protein loss in two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations and found that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is responsible for the loss of mutant protein expression. NMD is a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons. The authors generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) that obstruct the deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts and restoring mutant protein expression. This study lays the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies. The findings suggest that treatment with an SBO that inhibits NMD in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms have been shown to modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, researchers measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human ApoE genes (isoform 2, 3, or 4). The study identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of approximately 2700 ontologies. In the brain, ApoE4 and ApoE2 were found to lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. ApoE4 mice showed a lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy, which reduces protein quality. In contrast, ApoE2 mice showed an increase in degradation of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, suggesting coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. These changes were not observed in the liver, suggesting that the ApoE effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. The study highlights the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology. The findings provide new insights into the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and the role of ApoE in modulating disease risk.
The study presents a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila, a powerful model system for studying neuromuscular junction (NMJ) biology. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and show its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. They also demonstrate simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. Using CRISPR-TRiM, the authors discovered an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance and found that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Furthermore, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. The study reveals genes important for NMJ structural plasticity and demonstrates the utility of CRISPR-TRiM for studying NMJ biology. The authors generated several Cas9 lines that are expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles by Gal4-to-Cas9 conversion, enhancer-fusion, or CRISPR-mediated knock-in. They validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. The study expands the application of tissue-specific CRISPR to the Drosophila NMJ system, providing a powerful tool for dissecting gene functions in NMJ biology.
During Drosophila larval stages, the lymph gland progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ) and upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. The Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) is found to shield the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing the activation of JNK. Relish inhibits TAK1, which monitors the input from ROS and regulates JNK activation. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. Overexpressing Rel in progenitor cells leads to the downregulation of FAO, and genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors results in the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, coaxing them to differentiate. The study reveals that Relish expression wanes as the cells move towards differentiation during development. The NF-κB/Relish pathway is crucial in the Drosophila immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway, activating antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) transcription to combat gram-negative bacterial infections. Relish inhibits TAK1 to control JNK activation and prevent precocious differentiation of the ROS-enriched myeloid-like progenitors. The study highlights the importance of integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways in regulating cell fate transition during development.
A patient with clinical features of Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities, was found to have a homozygous pathogenic missense variant in the RTTN gene, RTTN c.2953A>G, rather than the expected pathogenic variant in the RNU4ATAC gene. The RTTN c.2953A>G variant alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23, leading to the production of aberrant RTTN isoforms. Cellular studies using patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) or cortical organoids (COs) revealed that the RTTN-mutated NSCs accumulated in the G2-M phase due to mitotic abnormalities, resulting in aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. The mitotic defects were associated with slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles, which may favor premature differentiation of NSCs into neurons. Additionally, RTTN-mutated cortical organoids showed delayed apico-basal polarization of NSCs, leading to a marked delay in rosette formation and overall growth. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c.2953A>G variant and shed light on the mechanisms leading to microcephaly in TALS. The study highlights the importance of RTTN in the self-organization of NSCs into neural rosettes and its role in maintaining proper cell cycle and mitotic processes.
In a long-term stationary phase (LTSP) experiment, Escherichia coli (E. coli) populations were allowed to adapt without external growth resources for up to six years. Whole-genome sequencing data from hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points revealed that E. coli continuously adapts genetically through the accumulation of mutations. This adaptation is highly convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The lineage structure of the populations is also convergent, with similar lineages established by the acquisition of the same RNA polymerase core (RNAPC) mutations. These lineages often behave similarly across populations. Convergent mutation acquisition was also observed, with different populations accumulating mutations to similar loci. The high parallelism of adaptations under LTSP enabled the identification of pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of historical contingency. These associations were found to be highly frequent, with a third of convergently mutated loci involved in at least one such association. The results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. The study provides insights into the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under prolonged resource exhaustion and highlights the importance of considering historical contingency in understanding evolutionary processes.
The male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has been found to code for a micropeptide that plays a crucial role in determining how mated females use stored sperm. The MSA transcript is a male-specific version of the iab-8 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which is expressed in both sexes in the posterior central nervous system. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, the iab-8 transcript does not. This study investigated the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript and found that the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA prevents downstream translation. These uORFs are present in the two unique 5' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA and prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. The study used cell culture and transgenic analysis to show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to this repressive mechanism. The results suggest that the iab-8 lncRNA is not translated into a protein due to the presence of uORFs, which is in contrast to the MSA transcript that codes for a micropeptide. The study provides new insights into the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript and the role of uORFs in preventing protein production. The findings have implications for our understanding of the complex regulation of gene expression in Drosophila.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, including N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to CDG. The clinical variability of CDG suggests that modifier genes may influence the phenotypes. To identify common genetic modifiers between CDG, the authors used evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis, which identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. The analysis revealed strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. The authors also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. The ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. The study highlights the potential of ERC analysis to identify common genetic modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) plays a crucial role in the encapsidation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) into nucleocapsids. The HBc protein contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) for pgRNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, particularly at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase (Pol) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. However, as capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation. Using a specific antibody, researchers observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state of HBc-Ser170 during pgRNA packaging. The polymerase-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed, and the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 was found to be dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via the epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. The Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and is associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These findings reveal the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation and suggest the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development.
The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and Caribbean, allowing for a natural experiment to study how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. This study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in this process by sequencing the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena (family Lucinidae) collected on either side of the Isthmus. The results showed that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, with those from the Caribbean having the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. This nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Further analysis revealed that the last common ancestor of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. The study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. The findings highlight the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.
The TAS2R family of G protein-coupled receptors plays a crucial role in bitter taste perception in vertebrates. While mammalian TAS2Rs have been extensively studied, the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain poorly understood. This study identifies 9,291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes and reveals that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TAS2R gene content. Phylogenomic analyses show that TAS2R genes are often found in clusters, with amphibians having additional clusters and more genes per cluster compared to other vertebrates. The study also finds that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although the total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Notably, TAS2R count is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays demonstrate that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. This suggests that increases in TAS2R number may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions in specific genes, a process known as gene subfunctionalization. The study's findings provide new insights into the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in vertebrates and highlight the importance of extra-oral TAS2Rs in amphibians.
A tri-protein complex containing Notch intracellular domain (NICD), RBPj, and MAML1 binds DNA as a monomer or cooperative dimer to regulate transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles (NDD) of Notch1 and Notch2 develop and age normally, but are sensitized to environmental insults. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation, but showed impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro and an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts. This suggests that Notch dimerization may not be essential for transcriptional regulation, but rather plays a role in modulating the proteome environment and innate immunity.

Further investigation using TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line revealed an unbalanced interactome in Notch2 dimerization-deficient cells, with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome. The use of the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid (VPA) showed that it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. These findings suggest that Notch dimerization in mammals may be less about transcriptional regulation and more about the overall proteome environment, with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions.
The theory of background selection, which describes how selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, has been extended to account for the effects of migration in an island model. Previous work had only quantified the effects of background selection on total neutral diversity (πT) and genetic differentiation (FST) in the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are low. The current study derives novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extends previous theory to the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are high. Simulations show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. The results suggest that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly in metapopulations with a larger effective population size. The study further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans. Theoretical predictions support the expectation that background selection weakly confounds locus-to-locus FST scans when gene flow is sufficiently common. Simulations suggest that this is true in an island model when migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles.
The increasing size of genetic and phenotypic data is crucial for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. However, practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions are hindered by methodological barriers, such as the need for complex statistical approaches to correct for confounders. Additionally, privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ) limit data sharing due to regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ). To address these issues, a federated approach has been proposed, where sensitive data remains at local sites and intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. A federated genetic association testing tool, FedGMMAT, has been developed using a federated statistical testing approach to correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among collaborating sites. FedGMMAT utilizes homomorphic encryption and a symmetric One-Time Pad ( OTP ) -like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics while aggregating them in the federated setting. The tool is flexible and can integrate multiple subject-level random effects and be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations. Using simulated and real datasets, FedGMMAT has been shown to achieve virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. This approach has the potential to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance in high-powered collaborative studies.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality rates. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer, but their accuracy varies across different populations. To address this issue, researchers have developed new algorithms to improve pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases, including prostate cancer. A recent study benchmarked the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. The study found modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared to a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. The findings underscore the importance of improving risk prediction algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. The study also demonstrated the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset and showed that genetic risk coupled with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer. The results suggest that PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone. However, given ancestry-associated prostate cancer incidence and outcome biases, it is crucial that risk scores work equally well across populations to limit disparities.
A drug repurposing screen was conducted on a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DPAGT1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. The Drosophila model exhibited a small, improperly developed eye phenotype. A library of 1,520 small molecules, 98% of which are FDA/EMA-approved, was screened to identify compounds that improved the eye phenotype. Forty-two candidate drugs were identified, and further analysis revealed that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. This suggests that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency, linking dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation. Genetic validation of other top drug categories, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1, also revealed novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms and potential therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG. These findings provide new insights into the biology of DPAGT1-CDG and identify potential therapeutic targets for the disorder. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of drug repurposing as a strategy for identifying new treatments for rare genetic disorders.
A novel computational model, the topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE), was developed to investigate the representation of limb pose in the somatosensory cortex. The model was trained on a large set of natural movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey centre-out reaching experiments: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model made several testable predictions, including the encoding across the cortex having a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs and few neurons encoding just a single joint. The topo-VAE model provides a principled basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. The model was designed to learn how to translate proprioceptive inputs from movements of the body into a latent representation of proprioception, with minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality. The authors aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding and formulated a novel computational model that predicts both neural coding of single neurons and the spatial organisation of these neurons across the cortex. The topo-VAE model was trained, validated, and tested on natural daily human arm movement kinematics, and the emergent proprioceptive representations in its cortical layer were explored.
The article reports the discovery of a functional ethylene receptor in the plant-associated bacterium Azospirillum brasilense, designated as Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 (AzoEtr1). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that putative ethylene receptors are present in other bacterial phyla, including non-pathogenic proteobacteria that associate with plants. The study demonstrates that AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity and that treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics reveal that ethylene causes widespread metabolic changes affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. These findings suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, indicating that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. This study provides new insights into the role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions and identifies potential targets for regulating beneficial plant-microbe associations. The discovery of a functional ethylene receptor in A. brasilense expands our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions and highlights the importance of ethylene as a signal molecule in these interactions.
This study investigated the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. Immunolocalization of INO80 at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, and the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicated incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) was reduced in Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of the histone variant H2A. Z. Instead, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on the sex chromosomes was observed in the absence of INO80. The data suggest that INO80 plays a role in DNA repair factor localization, facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema. INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DSB regions of the sex chromosomes and interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the axon regeneration pathway is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 has a dual function: it acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development. To understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration, researchers investigated the role of cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2. They found that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA. The study also found that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor, and that the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is essential for this process. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration in C. elegans.
The collective behaviour of zebrafish has been widely used to assess their physical and mental state, serving as a valuable tool to study the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and the effect of drugs. A new study demonstrates the potential of genetic modification in controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. The researchers genetically modified zebrafish by knocking out the col11a2 gene, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting col11a2-/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. The collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2-/- zebrafish were captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish were modelled by self-propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. This study demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model. The results show that by modelling the swimming behaviour of zebrafish as active matter, physiologically relevant behaviours can be revealed that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton. The study highlights the utility of this approach as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviours to genetic traits and physiological changes within the body.
The article presents a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations. The model combines the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. The results show good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, where elongated cells form network cords and round cells gather to create cobblestone-like aggregates. The study reveals that capillary-like networks develop in high integrity only when mechanical and chemical couplings work adequately, with cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively. The model encompasses the respective mechanisms of two VEGF forms on endothelial cells, with soluble VEGF inducing morphological changes and bound VEGF providing oriental signals. The capillary-like network development relies on adequate biogel deformation, sufficient bound VEGF, and a bound VEGF gradient to offer spatial cues for endothelial cells. The study highlights the importance of simultaneous mechanical and chemical coupling in capillary network development. While the computational results meet experiments in certain conditions, several problems remain, including the omission of bound VEGF in mechanical mechanisms and the inability of chemical mechanisms to fully reproduce results of tilted biogel experiments.
The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) family plays a crucial role in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, five TGF-β ligands have been identified: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3. These ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well-studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. This study demonstrates that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens and that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. The two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. The study also identifies TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 is known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A. The results show that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat4 expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited to double-strand breaks. The study reveals that Nat4 regulates the DDR signaling cascade by mediating its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity on histone H4. Cells lacking Nat4 exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph (γH2A) and diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Additionally, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks is significantly impaired in Nat4-deleted cells, leading to reduced Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation. Importantly, the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. This study highlights a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity. The findings expand the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR and shed light on a novel function for Nat4 N-terminal acetyltransferase in regulating the response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics.
The article introduces Orchard, a novel algorithm for reconstructing cancer phylogenies from bulk DNA sequencing data. Cancer phylogenies provide valuable insights into cancer development and guide treatment strategies. However, existing methods for reconstructing phylogenies become inaccurate when dealing with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. The algorithm optimizes each factor sequentially, allowing it to accurately reconstruct phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. Evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Orchard's large and accurate phylogenies are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. The algorithm can reliably reconstruct trees with up to 1000 mutations and 100 samples, alleviating the need for pre-clustering mutations. Orchard's reconstructions match or beat ground-truth baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer.
The article presents ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach for predicting the immunogenicity of CD8+ reactive epitopes. Immunogenicity prediction is a crucial step in the development of personalised cancer therapeutics, allowing for targeted and effective treatments. ImmugenX achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction, outperforming existing models by 7% in average precision. The model comprises a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module, and a set of context-specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. The pMHC encoding module performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art models on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability tasks. The integration of TCR context information further improves ImmugenX’s performance on immunogenicity prediction. The model’s performance is also evaluated for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing immunogenicity models and potential biases in public datasets. ImmugenX is designed as a modular framework, allowing for the addition of new inputs such as TCRs when available. The model is trained iteratively on related pMHC prediction tasks, enabling the use of all available data on immunogenicity-related pMHC prediction tasks.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association analysis of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens identified the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) as the causative gene for meat lightness and redness. The analysis revealed a significant association between PPP1CC expression and meat color, with a P-value of 8.65E-08. Mendelian randomization analyses further validated the causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness. Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout (PPP1CC-SSKO) mice were generated, which showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles, as well as a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and targeted metabolome analyses revealed that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes, and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intron of PPP1CC was found to regulate gene transcription activity. The study also detected differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, and expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of meat color and identify PPP1CC as a novel target gene for meat improvement technology. The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic basis of meat color for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology.
Biomedical researchers have developed a novel technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits within retinal ganglion cells. The technique involves presenting light stimuli to the retina at varying positions and angles, allowing for a tomographic reconstruction of subunits. Simulations demonstrate that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and experimental recordings from primate parasol ganglion cells validate the feasibility of this approach. The method has the potential to reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it suitable for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure. By identifying subunit locations, targeted stimuli can be used to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities, and functional synaptic weights of each subunit. This information can be used to evaluate the similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field, providing insights into the retinal circuitry. The STR technique has the potential to revolutionize the study of retinal function and may lead to a better understanding of the complex computations performed by the retina.
The article presents a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR for analyzing chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs) using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology. The method aims to identify genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics by quantifying the relative abundance of CRISPRi mutants in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted. CRISPRi-DR incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them. The method requires multiple sgRNAs for each target in the library, varying in predicted strength, and experimental quantification of sgRNA efficiencies in control conditions. The CRISPRi-DR model extends the Hill equation to incorporate an extra term representing the relative efficiency of each sgRNA targeting a gene. The model captures the non-linear interaction between sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration, where the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength. The authors demonstrate the performance of CRISPRi-DR in re-analyzing a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The results show that CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision compared to other related analytical methods, especially for noisier datasets. The method can be generalized to non-CGI datasets and provides a useful tool for identifying genes that interact with antibiotics.
The article presents a study that challenges the long-standing assumption that gene co-expression networks are organized into assortative modules, where genes within a module are more associated with each other than with genes in other modules. The authors use the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), a community detection method that does not assume modular organization, to analyze RNAseq gene expression data from two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. The results show that the SBM is able to identify ten times as many groups of genes as competing methods, and that several of these groups are not modular. Furthermore, the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. This suggests that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought, and that modularity may not be the main driver of gene co-expression network organization. The study highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information, beyond assortativity, when exploring biological networks. The authors also propose the use of more general measures of similarity, such as the weighted nested Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model (wnDC-SBM), to find meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation.
The study investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in post-transcriptional control in yeast. PABPC is involved in translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, the researchers used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and Ribo-Seq to analyze the abundance of the yeast proteome and transcriptome in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. The results showed that pab1Δ cells exhibited drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects in translation initiation and mRNA stabilization in pab1Δ cells were partly due to reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex, in addition to the general loss of Pab1's direct role in these processes. Furthermore, cells devoid of Pab1 manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. The study also found that deletion of PAB1 resulted in major changes in the transcriptome and proteome, but only minimal changes in relative translation efficiency. The results suggest that the elimination of PABPC is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. The study provides insights into the direct and indirect consequences of PAB1 deletion and highlights the complexity of interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells.
This study explores an alternative mechanism for generating slow brain rhythms in neurons, distinct from network-level mechanisms and intrinsically bursting neurons. The proposed mechanism involves the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and a one-dimensional slow dynamics of extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Using bifurcation analysis and the slow-fast method, the authors reveal that this coupling can generate a hysteresis loop and bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation, a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. The authors suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. A minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics is presented, which can contribute to a better understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies. The study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular potassium dynamics and Na+/K+-ATPase can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond. The findings demonstrate that the interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability in class I neuron models with SNIC dynamics can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions.
The study presents the COPS R-package, a framework for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. The framework was applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, the approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. The study emphasizes the importance of multi-objective evaluation, applying the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were found to be the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation of multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. The findings provide insights into the potential of multi-omics clustering analysis for cancer subtyping and may have implications for improving patient stratification and personalized treatment.
The SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in the development of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. A novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele was identified, which revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is necessary for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Furthermore, SEM-2 directly regulates the expression of hlh-8, a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor that plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. The data suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. These findings add to the understanding of the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. Previous studies have identified multiple transcription factors and signaling components essential for M lineage development, including LIN-12/Notch signaling and the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9. SEM-2 encodes the sole SoxC protein in C. elegans, whereas vertebrates have three SoxC proteins, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12. Amino acid P158 is conserved in SoxC homologs from vertebrates and is located near the end of SEM-2’s DNA-binding domain. SMA-9 and LET-381 repress the expression of sem-2 in the dorsal side of the M lineage to prevent it from specifying the SM fate. HLH-8 functions in proper patterning of the M lineage, including proper cleavage orientation, proliferation of the SMs, and differentiation and function of the vulval muscles.
