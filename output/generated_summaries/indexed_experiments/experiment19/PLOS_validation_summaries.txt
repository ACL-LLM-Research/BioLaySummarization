Title: Genetics and Regulatory Impact of Alternative Polyadenylation in Human B-Lymphoblastoid Cells

    A recent study investigated the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulating gene expression in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals and found that transcript end positions did not occur randomly in untranslated regions. Instead, they preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay.

    Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes, and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms. Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5, the researchers established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation.

    The study highlights the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The findings suggest that integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a critical tool in interpreting human genome variation. The study also speculates that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population.
A live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine, SIVΔnef, has been shown to be highly effective in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective efficacy are not well understood. To investigate this, researchers used deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to study the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. The study found that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection targets more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. As a result, the CD8 T cell repertoire expands to target highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These findings correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. The study also demonstrated that epitope escape leads to the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection, and that these responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells, contributing to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response. The results suggest that SIVΔnef is a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the importance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective efficacy of SIVΔnef and has implications for the development of effective HIV/SIV vaccines.
Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling plays a crucial role in coordinating the neutrophil response to Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa. Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), researchers found that IL-1R signaling is essential for fungal control at the onset of infection. The study demonstrated that IL-1R regulates the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the circulation in response to C. albicans. The study identified endothelial cells as the primary source of G-CSF during OPC, which responded to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. These findings establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection. The study highlights the importance of IL-1R signaling in coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa, which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination, and thus protects the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals in 48 endemic countries through annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs. This effort resulted in significant economic benefits, with an estimated US$21.8 billion in direct economic benefits gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, US$2.3 billion is attributed to the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Additionally, over 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefited from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19.5 billion. Furthermore, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saved the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2.2 billion. The economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, with favorable program implementation costs largely due to sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The study highlights the significant economic benefits of MDA for LF, making it an excellent investment in global health.
A novel model of neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD) has been established in medaka (Oryzias latipes) using a glucocerebrosidase (GBA) nonsense mutant (GBA-/-). This model displays pathological phenotypes similar to human neuronopathic GD, including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brain, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed pathological analysis revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Notably, disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka. This study provides insights into the pathological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD. Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease, caused by homozygous mutations in the GBA gene, leading to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and accumulation of its substrates. Mutations in GBA have also been linked to an increased risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the accumulation of α-syn in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. The GBA-/- medaka model provides a valuable tool for investigating the relationship between GCase deficiency and α-syn accumulation, and may aid in the development of novel therapies for neuronopathic GD and PD.
Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular pathogen, induces a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection. The bacterium's ability to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is crucial for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell–mediated protective immunity. However, research has shown that the impaired T cell response to L. monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not solely due to inefficient antigen presentation, but rather the direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression not only limits the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L. monocytogenes but also negates the response to bacteria within the cytosol. Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocytogenes prevents the generation of acquired immunity and limits the expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L. monocytogenes strain alone. The presence of L. monocytogenes within a phagosome suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restores protective immunity. These findings demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common subtype of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus (rs10483727, odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, p = 3.87×10−11). The SIX6 gene plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve. To further investigate the relationship between SIX6 and POAG, the authors sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls. Six nonsynonymous coding variants were identified, including five rare and one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was significantly associated with POAG (OR = 1.27, p = 4.2×10−10) in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets. The variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. The results showed that five variants, primarily found in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. Furthermore, the authors identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent on SIX6 genotype: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele (Asn141). The results suggest that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.
In the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile, a genetic switch known as the flagellar switch controls the production of flagella and glucosylating toxins. The flagellar switch is a 154 bp invertible sequence located upstream of the flgB operon and is flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats. When the flagellar switch is in the ON orientation, bacteria express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete the toxins. In contrast, when the switch is in the OFF orientation, bacteria are attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, are aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion. The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro. Gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C. difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. The flagellar switch affects transcription of the toxin genes by way of σD, impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C. difficile. Flagellar phase ON bacteria and recV mutants with the flagellar switch locked in the ON orientation display peritrichous flagella, engage in swimming motility, and produce the glucosylating toxins. In contrast, flagellar phase OFF bacteria and recV mutants with the flagellar switch locked in the OFF orientation are attenuated for transcription of flagellar genes and toxin production. The flagellar switch orientation controls toxin production in addition to flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility, indicating that these major virulence factors are coordinately phase variable in C. difficile.
The study investigated the spore differentiation pathway in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that relies on endospore formation for its infectious cycle. The researchers examined the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors (σF, σE, σG, and σK) in C. difficile, which are essential for controlling gene expression during endospore development. The results showed that while the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, there are significant deviations from the paradigm established in the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Specifically, the activity of σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. Furthermore, σK is not strictly required for heat-resistant spore formation. The study also found that the temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors is reduced in C. difficile compared to B. subtilis. The results suggest that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway. However, the study also highlights differences in the function and period of activity of the sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile compared to other Clostridial species, which may be related to the coordination of solventogenesis, toxin production, or other functions with sporulation.
The article presents a compact framework for modeling the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable. This reduction is shown to closely replicate the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models. The framework is useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously. Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. The framework is applied to a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. The known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth has occurred. The framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modification, such as ligand binding, multisite transcription factor regulation, and multisite methylation or acetylation.
The LsrR Quorum Sensing “Switch” Is Revealed by a Bottom-Up Approach
    The autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) quorum sensing system of E. coli was studied using a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction. The system was separated into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms. A new unreported negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model, revealing the importance of the LsrR regulator and its determinant role in the E. coli QS “switch”. The LsrR-mediated genetic “switch” of E. coli QS circuitry was found to be buried but still effective in the native system. The AI-2 uptake mechanism was taken apart and analyzed in isolation, leading to the speculation of new regulatory interactions within the network. A bottom-up approach was employed to analyze the natural biological network, isolating important regulatory elements and constructing a hypothetical model to predict the existence of new regulatory mechanisms. This approach allowed for the simulation of both the intact network and its sub-systems using the new proposed network architecture. The results provide a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network. The study sheds light on other regulatory pathways within the metabolic networks of bacterial cells and may be used to guide phenotypes in new ways as the quorum sensing switches become incorporated into various biotechnological applications.
This study investigated the effect of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) on the prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children living in rural areas of Gabon. The study found that schistosomiasis tends to increase the risk of Plasmodium infection, but a combined effect with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection significantly increases the risk. The incidence of malaria over time was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group, with a significant delay of time-to-first-malaria event only in children aged 6-10 years old infected with Schistosoma haematobium. The results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. The study highlights the need to account for STH and schistosomiasis co-infections when designing malaria control programs in areas of co-endemicity. The findings support the consideration of STH and schistosomiasis control as an additional tool for malaria control. The study's longitudinal design allowed for a more precise examination of the interactions between schistosomiasis and malaria, providing evidence for the cumulative impact of these co-infections on malaria outcome in school-age children.
IRF-5-Mediated Inflammation Limits CD8+ T Cell Expansion by Inducing HIF-1α and Impairing Dendritic Cell Functions during Leishmania Infection

    IRF-5-dependent inflammation induced by Leishmania donovani infection inhibits CD8+ T cell expansion and the development of short-lived effector cells (SLECs) by inducing HIF-1α in dendritic cells and altering DC functions. IRF-5 is involved in the transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, TNF, IL-23, and IL-6. IRF-5 is essential for the development of protective Th1 responses, and its ablation leads to a higher frequency of SLECs, enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Mice with targeted depletion of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that HIF-1α induction in DCs represents an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. HIF-1α upregulation in DCs resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression. Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells led to a higher frequency of SLECs, enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and significantly reduced parasite burden. These findings indicate that IRF-5-mediated inflammation induced by Leishmania at early stages of infection plays a detrimental role in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses.
A systematic review of 14 studies on American visceral leishmaniasis (VL) conducted in Latin America was conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with adverse outcomes and death. The review found that jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age less than 5 years, age greater than 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections were the strongest predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with poor outcomes. The review highlights the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models to aid in the identification and management of patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes. The lack of reduction in fatality rates of VL in Brazil is attributed to limitations in therapy, delay in diagnosis, and inadequate management of high-risk patients. The review suggests that undernutrition is not a risk factor for severity or mortality in VL, but rather a consequence of the wasting syndrome associated with the disease. The findings of this review provide valuable information for clinical practice and highlight the need for further research to develop effective prognostic models. The review emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the development of externally validated prognostic models to improve patient outcomes in VL.
The study investigated the antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates collected over a 30-year period in Algeria. The researchers analyzed 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in 14 localities where leishmaniasis is endemic, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. The 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC50 ) of potassium antimony tartrate ( Sb ( III ) ) and sodium stibogluconate ( Sb ( V ) ) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff ( ECOFF ) values were established to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible ( S+ ) or insusceptible ( S- ) to the trivalent form of antimony. The results showed a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) isolates was observed during the same period. The emergence of S- phenotypes correlated with the inclusion of L. killicki ( syn: L. tropica ) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study highlights the need for an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains. The results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria.
The study investigated the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn’s disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition. Researchers developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD. The results showed that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, leading to an increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. The study found that AIEC-colonized mice that developed infectious gastroenteritis had a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-naive animals exposed to the same infection stimuli. The tissue-associated expansion of AIEC required resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. The study suggests that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, the data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, which could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, surrounded by five accessory cells. The mechanisms governing the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. A screen for regulators of egg cell fate identified the lachesis ( lis ) mutant, which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, suggesting that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. The lis-1 mutant phenotype reveals two levels of cell fate regulation, one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cell. The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that in Arabidopsis distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization. In lis-1 mutant gametophytes, accessory cells become gradually recruited as gametic cells, and several morphological features that distinguish lis-1/LIS plants from wild type become more pronounced over time. The lis-1 mutation was mapped to the At2g41500 locus, which encodes a protein with seven WD40 repeats. These findings suggest that all cells in the female gametophyte are competent to differentiate gametic cell fate and that LIS is involved in a mechanism that represses gametic cell fate in accessory cells.
In a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis, a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) triggered by exposure to irritant soils, a qualitative study was conducted to explore the barriers related to the use of footwear. The study used the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes. A total of 242 respondents participated in focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies. The results showed that shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as "shameful." However, many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. Limited financial resources meant that people were unable to purchase more than one pair of shoes, ensuring their longevity, or afford shoes of the preferred quality. As a result, shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age. The study identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention, including financial constraints, poor suitability of shoes for daily activities, and low risk perception. These barriers are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs. The findings suggest that targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing, as well as their perceived capabilities to prevent NTDs, is crucial for effective prevention through shoe distribution programs.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons. Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. To understand how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of viral proteins, researchers investigated the association of Us9 with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are microdomains on the surface of infected cells that are involved in protein sorting and trafficking. The study found that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts and that this association is critical for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. In non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires characteristics of sympathetic neurons, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. These findings suggest that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. The study demonstrates that Us9 is essential for the axonal sorting of viral capsids and glycoproteins, and that lipid rafts play a critical role in this process.
Genetically identical cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit phenotypic variation in growth rate and stress tolerance under constant and benign conditions, a phenomenon known as nongenetic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity has important clinical implications, as it is observed in tumors and microbial infections. The study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this heterogeneity and found that it is controlled by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP )-regulated transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway. The study used genetic and chemical perturbations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression, to show that lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth and increased susceptibility to acute heat stress. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 were found to differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 being required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbations that increase intracellular cAMP levels reduced the slower-growing subpopulation and increased susceptibility to acute heat stress, while PKA inhibition slowed growth and decreased susceptibility to acute heat stress. The study suggests that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, acting through Msn2 and Msn4, underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance, and provides a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.
During the 2013-2014 outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Caribbean, a team of researchers conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis to understand the genetic diversity of the virus in infected individuals. The study focused on samples from Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands at the epicenter of the epidemic. Using deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines, the researchers identified changes in the consensus sequence and a diverse range of minority variants present in the population. Notably, they found that the overall diversity of the virus was significantly reduced after a single passage in cell lines. Furthermore, the team constructed an infectious clone from the outbreak and discovered a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure, not previously found in nature, which led to increased replication in insect cells. This new UTR structure was unique among circulating CHIKV strains worldwide. The study also performed an intrahost quasispecies analysis, revealing novel variants present in infected individuals. The findings suggest that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time since entering the naïve population in the Americas. The results highlight the importance of continued viral diversity surveillance over time to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. The study provides an in-depth look at the minority variants present during the ongoing CHIKV epidemic, identifying novel variants and structural elements that can inform future research on the pathogenesis, adaptation, and evolution of CHIKV in the Americas.
The study identifies UBTOR, a previously unannotated gene, as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. UBTOR depletion in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth and activates mTOR signaling, leading to increased cell growth. Conversely, UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complex, to inhibit mTOR signaling. In zebrafish models, disruption of the ubtor gene upregulates mTOR signaling and promotes HRAS(G12V)-mediated tumor formation. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrate that UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling. The study also shows that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes, and that NGF treatment upregulates UBTOR expression, which may help to keep mTOR signaling activity in check. The results suggest that UBTOR plays a role in regulating cellular growth and neoplasia, and that its dysregulation may contribute to cancer development. Overall, the study highlights the importance of UBTOR in mTOR signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
The study presents a comprehensive protein complex map of Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. Using in-depth biochemical fractionation and a rigorous methodology, the researchers identified 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 previously uncharacterized proteins. These complexes correlate with known pathways and proteins co-expressed across the T. brucei life cycle, providing potential functions for a large number of uncharacterized proteins. The study also validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, including a candidate involved in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. The protein complex map is the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date and serves as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. The results provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei and offer a useful resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and experimental leads. The study's findings are available at www. TrypsNetDB. org. The researchers used two complementary biochemical fractionation approaches to systematically study protein complexes in T. brucei, leading to the assignment of many previously uncharacterized proteins to complexes. The predicted essential complexes recapitulated previous findings for T. brucei, including the cytoplasmic ribosomal complex, proteasome, and T-complex, which are essential in all life stages of the parasite.
Lymph nodes (LNs) are a common site of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the dynamics of Mtb infection in LNs and its impact on LN structure and function are not well understood. This study investigated Mtb infection in thoracic LNs of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques using PET CT scans, bacterial burden, and immune function analysis. The results showed that LNs in Mtb-infected macaques exhibited increased metabolic activity early during infection, and at necropsy, almost all FDG-avid LNs contained viable Mtb or persistent Mtb DNA. The study found that Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaque LNs were better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaque LNs. In contrast to lung granulomas, LNs were found to be poor at killing Mtb, even with drug treatment. Granulomas that form in LNs disrupt LN structure, pushing out T cells and B cells, introducing large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb, and destroying normal vasculature. The data suggest that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection but also serve as important sites for the persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli. The study highlights the dynamic process of mycobacterial involvement in thoracic LNs and the need for further investigation into the role of LNs in Mtb infection.
A large collection of 47 nematode-infecting microsporidia has been isolated and cultured from wild nematodes, including Caenorhabditis elegans and other related species. The most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild is Nematocida parisii, which was previously identified as the first natural intracellular pathogen of C. elegans. In addition to N. parisii, six new species in the Nematocida genus have been described, as well as two new subclades, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. These microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and primarily infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level, spores of Enteropsectra exhibit a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off the plasma membrane, whereas spores of Nematocida exit via exocytosis. The host specificity of these microsporidia varies, with some species infecting multiple nematode species while others exhibit narrow host specificity. Furthermore, the microsporidian N. ausubeli fails to induce the transcription of genes in C. elegans that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent host response. This collection of microsporidia provides a rich resource for investigating host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts and highlights the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. Recent studies have shown that homo- and heterodimers or higher-order oligomers of chemokine receptors modulate receptor function. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the spontaneous homo- and heterodimerization of chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2. The results reveal that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol that differ from CXCR4. Cholesterol was found to modulate the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. The study provides a comprehensive structural overview of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs. The findings suggest that cholesterol can increase the dynamic range and versatility of associations of closely related transmembrane receptors.
Systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, has been traditionally characterized by symptoms such as prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. However, a sub-clinical form of the disease has been identified, presenting with one or two of these symptoms missing, and other findings such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. A third, unsuspected form of the disease, referred to as "atypical" systemic leishmaniasis, has been discovered. This form presents with symptoms masquerading as a condition of non-functional immune system, leading to recurrent secondary infections and a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. The atypical form was identified in 19.4% of 160 patients with suspected immune deficiency, who underwent specialized laboratory tests, including microscopic examinations and cultures of biopsies. These patients had close to normal laboratory profiles, but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites. The findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis has a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected and is more common than diagnosed to date. The disease is not limited to the pediatric age group, as adults were also affected. The authors recommend considering atypical systemic leishmaniasis in patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. The discovery of this new form of the disease highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating systemic leishmaniasis.
Genome-Wide Analysis of Human Disease Alleles Reveals That Their Locations Are Correlated in Paralogous Proteins
    A genome-wide analysis of human disease alleles was conducted to investigate the potential of variants occurring at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. A collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD was assembled and used to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. The results demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This suggests that information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study also found that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, indicating that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non-disease-causing variants along their lengths. These findings provide a novel resource for functional genomics and suggest that paralogous human genes can be used to identify new disease gene candidates and uncharacterized variants within them likely to have phenotypic consequences.
The study analyzed the transcriptomes of 44 Plasmodium falciparum isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had altered gene expression profiles compared to those causing uncomplicated malaria. Specifically, severe malaria parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure, and reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, a major target of protective immunity. Additionally, multiple chaperone proteins were down-regulated in severe malaria parasites. The study also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments, and confirmed previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. Notably, the severe malaria parasites had down-regulated genes involved in PfEMP1 surface expression, which may explain why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than immunity to uncomplicated malaria. The findings suggest that parasites adapt to or are selected by the host environment in severe malaria, and may inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria. Overall, the study provides new insights into the Plasmodium falciparum transcriptome in severe malaria and highlights the complex interactions between the parasite and the host environment.
Title: AAV-Delivered Antibody Mediates Significant Protective Effects against SIVmac239 Challenge in the Absence of Neutralizing Activity

    AAV vectors were used to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG1 form to rhesus monkeys, achieving persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved. Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus, the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects following repeated, marginal dose, intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac239. These effects included lowering of viral load at peak height, lowering of viral load at set point, and delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of infectious virus exposure. All of these effects were statistically significant. Notably, the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i.v. challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i.v. infectious units. These results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people. However, the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.
The article presents a numerical investigation of conformational relaxation properties in two motor proteins, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, using the coarse-grained elastic network approximation. The study challenges the assumption of linear response of protein molecules to thermal noise or structural perturbations, which is commonly used in protein dynamics studies. The authors found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. Specifically, the normal mode description fails to accurately describe functional mechanochemical motions in KIF1A, a monomeric motor protein from the kinesin superfamily. While slow conformational relaxation motions in myosin V can still be qualitatively characterized in terms of normal modes, the normal mode description breaks down completely for KIF1A. However, the study reveals that ordered and robust mechanochemical motions are characteristic for both protein motors, even though they cannot be described in terms of linear response. The results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered, as neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics. The study provides new insights into the conformational relaxation processes associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis in motor proteins, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of protein dynamics.
This study investigated the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of crosstalk between different clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. The researchers found that specific caveolar proteins, including Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, act as negative regulators of the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment (CLIC/GEEC) endocytic pathway. Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 inhibited the CLIC/GEEC pathway in a process independent of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAV3 also inhibited the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression. The expression of caveolar proteins led to a reduction in the formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers, as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the CLIC/GEEC pathway was upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. The inhibition by caveolins could be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and was associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components, as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. In the absence of cavins, CAV1 was itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway, but the pathway lost polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. Noncaveolar Cavin-1 was found to act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42. The study provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways.
The Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains are a subclass of atypical Receiver (REC) domains that lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue typically phosphorylated by sensory histidine kinases in two-component signaling systems. A comprehensive analysis of deposited REC domains revealed that ALRs are surprisingly common, comprising approximately 4% of all REC domains, or about 2 per completed genome in bacteria. These domains are enriched when attached to rare effector outputs and have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation. The ALR archetype, RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been structurally, biochemically, and genetically characterized, showing that ALRs largely retain the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. The conserved phospho-Asp site in ALRs is often substituted with residues such as Ser, Thr, Tyr, Arg, and Cys, which can be phosphorylated by bacterial Ser-Thr kinases, Tyr kinases, or arginine-specific kinases. These substitutions suggest that ALRs have diversified to accommodate various signaling inputs, including binding small molecules and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases. The identification of ALRs as an atypical REC subclass provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains and highlights the complexity and diversity of two-component signaling systems in bacteria, Archaea, and plants.
Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) have shown efficacy in clinical trials and practice, but most are attenuated or over-attenuated due to deletions or mutations in genes that counteract the host response. To address this limitation, a new generation of oHSVs has been developed that carry no deletions or mutations and gain cancer-specificity through specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors, such as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). These fully-virulent oHSVs replicate efficiently in tumor cells while sparing other cells in the tumor. This study reports on the first efficacy study of a HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent oHSV armed with IL-12 (R-115) in immunocompetent mice. The results show that both the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 (HER2-LLC1) tumor, with R-115 being more efficacious. Notably, mice that survived the primary treated tumor were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors, indicating an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response revealed that R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines, including IFNγ and T-bet, which promoted Th1 polarization. The study highlights the potential of fully-virulent, retargeted oHSVs as a novel approach to cancer therapy, eliciting local immunity and vaccine therapy towards distant tumors.
A recent study investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. The study compared the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and canarypox viral vector (ALVAC) to HIV. The results showed that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV, whereas ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analyses revealed that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-β) but little IL-17. The study also found that ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Depletion of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and suggest that the choice of vaccine vector may impact the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV infection.
The article presents a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution in therian mammals. X inactivation is the process by which females transcriptionally silence one of their two X chromosomes in each somatic cell. The study examines how conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies, which can range from strict paternally inherited X inactivation ( PXI ) to unbiased random X inactivation ( RXI ). The results indicate that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. RXI is favored over PXI when alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive, and the criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. The study also predicts that species-specific properties of mutation and genetic variation can affect patterns of selection for different X inactivation strategies, and that sex-differential selection can influence the relative transmission probabilities of female-deleterious alleles between maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes. The results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes.
The study investigated the antiviral potential of human zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). The results showed that overexpression of ZAP inhibited JEV infection, while depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication. In contrast, DENV and ZIKV were not affected by ZAP overexpression. ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3'-5' RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. JEV 3'-UTR, particularly in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide, was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP. The study identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus and suggested that ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection. The data also indicated that 3'-5' RNA degradation by the exosome complex is involved in the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection. Furthermore, the study found that ZAP overexpression boosted innate immune responses during JEV infection, as measured by increased mRNA levels of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines.
The study investigated the pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in C57BL/6 mice using wild-type strain ZH501 and attenuated vaccine strain MP-12. The results showed that mice infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with minimal clinical disease and cytokine response. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal, causing lymphopenia, platelet depletion, and a strong systemic cytokine response, which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. The study found that RVFV is hepatotropic, with significant clinical and histological data supporting liver involvement. However, a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent, instead, a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils, was observed. In the brains of ZH501-infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. The data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver function loss due to liver necrosis and hepatitis, while the long-term course of disease for those that survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature. The study highlights the differences in host response to infection with wild-type and attenuated RVFV strains, providing insights into the mechanisms of RVFV pathogenesis. The findings have implications for the development of effective vaccines and treatments for RVFV infection.
Chemotherapy-induced C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) promotes chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by enhancing the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and increasing the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. CCL20 activates the p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway through protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, which in turn promotes the expression of ABCB1 and CCL20, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances chemoresistance. This feedback loop is mediated by the activation of p65 NF-κB, which regulates the transcription of both ABCB1 and CCL20. As a result, CCL20 promotes the proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of TNBC cells and enhances their resistance to taxane. Furthermore, CCL20 also exhibits strengthening in resistance to taxane, demonstrating its pivotal role in the regulation of breast cancer malignancy. The study suggests that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway may reverse taxane resistance in breast cancer patients. The combination of taxane treatment and the adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 may greatly improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer, including TNBC.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. The parasite’s ability to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport proteins called GRAs across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane ( PVM ) into the host cell. GRAs have diverse roles in Toxoplasma’s intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting host cell functions and proteins. However, the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. A previous study identified a protein called TgMYR1 as essential for GRA transport into the host cell. To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, researchers screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. The study found that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1. The proteins are membrane-associated and MYR3 stably associates with MYR1, whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. The study also found that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.
The E2 protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) binds to the origin recognition complex 2 (ORC2), a component of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). However, ORC2 is not detected at the viral origin of replication. Depletion of ORC2 enhances viral replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes, but has no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes. In contrast, over-expression of HPV E2 decreases ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification. These findings imply that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation-dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins. ORC2 co-immunoprecipitates with BPV-1 and HPV-31 E2, and its depletion increases viral copy number in transient replication assays and in keratinocytes that maintain episomal HPV-16 genomes. Repeated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays failed to detect endogenous ORC2 near the HPV-16 or HPV-31 long control region (LCR), while ORC2 was detectable near the mammalian origin of replication present within the GM-CSF gene.
This study investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. A total of 564 cow milk samples were collected from 326 herds in 21 villages, and DNA was detected in 10.3% of the samples using IS711-based real-time PCR. Brucella DNA was found in the milk of all seropositive cows, but also in 8.3% of seronegative cows. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggested that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. The study highlights the need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. The results also suggest that vaccination of cattle with S19, in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1, might be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. However, further research is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region. The study's findings are concerning, given that consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region.
The study investigated the role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) and H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me3) in maintaining genome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. Z. tritici has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, and enriched with heterochromatic histone methylation marks, including H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. The researchers deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, kmt1 and kmt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. They used whole-genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure, and differences in gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains. The results showed that loss of H3K9me3 led to dramatic chromatin reorganization, with H3K27me3 being relocalized to regions enriched with H3K9me3 in wild-type strains. Many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of H3K9me3, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of H3K27me3 increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro, without large-scale changes in gene activity. The study concludes that H3K9me3 is essential for maintaining genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. The findings suggest that H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a "metastable" state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.
Title: Evaluation of Cost-Effective Strategies for Rabies Post-Exposure Vaccination in Low-Income Countries

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is crucial in preventing rabies, a fatal disease. However, life-saving vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible and unaffordable, particularly for the poorest populations who bear the largest burden of rabies. To address this issue, researchers analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits. The study found that PEP vaccination is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost ranging from $200 to less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of PEP was shown to result in significant savings in vaccine volume and costs, which could mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs for healthcare providers. The study also identified financing mechanisms that could make PEP more affordable and accessible, including subsidies for those in need and support for rabies control and prevention programs. The results suggest that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths and cost savings for healthcare providers. The study demonstrates that ID delivery of PEP is considerably more cost-effective than IM delivery in terms of averting rabies cases and saving lives.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, exploits host lipid droplets (LD) as a source of lipids for its intracellular development. The parasite replicates within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. The study found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in triacylglycerol (TAG) lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes increase until the onset of parasite replication. Toxoplasma accesses lipids stored in host LD and incorporates them into its own membranes and LD. Exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell, resulting in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids in very large LD inside the parasite. Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes host LD within the PV, some of which remain associated with Rab7 and become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity for lipid uptake from host LD. Additionally, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV. Gavage of parasites with lipids reveals the presence of endocytic-like structures containing lipidic material originating from the PV lumen. These findings highlight the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and its capability to scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.
Biomedical researchers have identified chalcones as potential inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L, a key enzyme involved in the parasite's life cycle. Fasciola hepatica is a liver fluke that causes fasciolosis, a widespread disease in cattle and sheep, and is increasingly recognized as an emerging zoonotic disease in humans. Current chemotherapy relies on triclabendazole, but resistance to this drug has been reported in several countries, highlighting the need for new control measures. A library of 40 flavonoid derivatives was screened for inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases (FhCL3 and FhCL1), and chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups emerged as effective inhibitors. One compound, C34, was found to bind tightly to juvenile-specific FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 was shown to be a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues, determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases. In vitro studies demonstrated that C34 reduces the ability of the parasite to migrate through the gut wall and induces a loss of motility phenotype, leading to parasite death within a week. Notably, C34 is not cytotoxic to bovine cells. This study identifies chalcones as novel inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins and opens new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and potentially other helminthic diseases.
The visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways, with bipolar cells (BCs) playing a crucial role in transmitting these signals to the inner retina. Using in vivo imaging, researchers investigated how BCs transmit signals to the inner retina and found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments directly contribute to differences in response dynamics. Voltage-dependent calcium channels in the synaptic terminal of BCs are responsible for the first major non-linear transformation of the visual signal as it is transmitted through the retina. The output from the synapse is impacted by variations in filtering of the presynaptic calcium signal, with smaller terminals responding to a step of light with higher relative release rates. The synaptic terminal of BCs exhibits strong rectification, with an increase in stimulus variance causing an increase in the mean rate of vesicle release even when the mean luminance is held constant. A model predicted that the rate of vesicle release would depress more profoundly in smaller terminals.
A novel probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) image data has been developed and tested using conjugate array tomography (cAT) datasets that provide voxel-conjugate fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) images of the same individual synapses. The method uses a probabilistic model-based synapse detector that accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. The algorithm was evaluated by comparing its performance to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its ability to reproduce known features of cortical synapse distributions. The results show that the algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. The probabilistic synapse detector may also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical. The method addresses the challenges of detecting synapses in immunofluorescence images and has potential applications in large-scale synapse detection and single-synapse molecular profiling of diverse synapse populations. The algorithm may also be useful for analyzing volume images large enough to contain complete neural arbors, allowing discernment of the relationships between detected synapses and their presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons.
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, and immune and nervous system functions. Impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport is mediated by two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 being responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2 is currently unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and investigate its coupling to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles. Using computational modeling and experimental approaches, including functional zinc transport assays, the authors demonstrated that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase, abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. Additionally, the authors showed that ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc resulted in vesicular pH alkalization, which was reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Computational energy calculations suggested that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ions. Therefore, ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger that concentrates zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and its role in zinc homeostasis.
This study identifies 14-3-3 proteins as novel interaction partners of Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) in both yeast and mammalian cells. Exo1 is responsible for processing stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells. The research reveals that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and other unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress. In yeast 14-3-3 deficient cells, Exo1-dependent single-stranded DNA gaps accumulate at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Furthermore, the study shows that 14-3-3 proteins facilitate fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations using DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis. The findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins act as central integrators of signals that regulate fork stability and processing. The study proposes that 14-3-3 proteins modulate Exo1 phosphorylation and activity to prevent unscheduled Exo1 activity behind stalled replication forks in a checkpoint-proficient background. The research also implies that 14-3-3 proteins may regulate additional targets during replication stress, possibly through modulation of their phosphorylation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of 14-3-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability during DNA replication stress.
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play a complex role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis. In humanized mice, HIV-1 infection leads to persistent infection and immunopathogenesis, characterized by type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, immune activation, and depletion of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. To investigate the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection, a monoclonal antibody was developed to specifically deplete pDC in humanized mice. Depletion of pDC prior to HIV-1 infection abolished the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during acute HIV-1 infection, resulting in increased HIV-1 replication. However, pDC depletion also reduced cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate. During chronic HIV-1 infection, pDC depletion reduced IFN-I and ISG induction, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Notably, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells, including T cells, was reduced in pDC-depleted mice, despite increased viral replication. These findings suggest that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and promoting HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis. The results also indicate that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective antiretrovirus treatment.
Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit HIV infection in primary macrophages through the activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a transcription regulator that controls the expression of anti-oxidant genes. SFN mobilizes Nrf2 to reprogram cellular gene expression, leading to a block in HIV infection after reverse transcription but before the formation of 2-LTR circles. This restriction is mediated by Nrf2, as siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 increased HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. The study found that macrophages express sufficient Nrf2 to maintain a partial restriction on HIV infection even in the absence of SFN. In contrast, SFN did not inhibit HIV infection in primary T cells or in other cell lines tested. The results suggest that SFN's anti-viral activity is not due to direct modification of the virus or a cellular component required for infection, but rather through the activation of Nrf2. This study highlights a novel way to trigger Nrf2-mediated inhibition of HIV infection, which could have implications for the development of new anti-viral therapies. The findings also contrast with previous studies showing that Nrf2 activation is beneficial for other viruses, such as Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and Dengue virus.
Geohelminth infections are common among pregnant women in rural western Kenya, with 76. 2% of 390 participants infected with at least one geohelminth species. The most prevalent species were Ascaris lumbricoides ( 52. 3% ), hookworm ( 39. 5% ), and Trichuris trichiura ( 29. 0% ). Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] 1. 8, 95% confidence interval [ CI ] 1. 1–3. 0 ) and the lack of treatment of drinking water ( AOR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1–3. 1 ). However, geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or low body mass index. Hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference ( adjusted mean decrease 0. 7 cm, 95% CI 0. 3–1. 2 cm ). Hookworm infections with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces ( 11 women ) were associated with lower hemoglobin ( adjusted mean decrease 1. 5 g/dl, 95% CI 0. 3–2. 7 ). Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with A. lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia ( OR 0. 4, 95% CI 0. 2–0. 8 ) compared to women without A. lumbricoides.
The study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of mycolactone, a macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, on the nervous system. Mycolactone has previously been shown to have cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties, which are attributed to its ability to block the Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells. This study aimed to determine whether mycolactone affects the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which are involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance. The researchers found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cell types without affecting their viability. Notably, mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia, which are critical contributors to neuroinflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve, mycolactone injected into the spinal canal decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity. The study provides evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, suggesting that its analgesic properties may be partially explained by its anti-inflammatory effects. These findings have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for chronic pain management.
The study investigated the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and clinical phenotypes of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. A total of 425 individuals, including 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls, were genotyped for 28 SNPs in eight genes. The results showed that IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24-0.63], BONF = 0.0034). In contrast, MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele were associated with an increased risk of latent infections (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07-2.53], BONF = 0.6697 and p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18-2.95], BONF = 0.2157, respectively). The study also confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was associated with a higher risk (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49-4.91], BONF = 0.0301) and APOL1 G1 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29-0.70], BONF = 0.0129) of developing HAT. No associations were found with other candidate genes. These findings suggest that host genes are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea.
The genetic structure and diversity of 38 South Asian Indians from Singapore were investigated through deep whole-genome sequencing as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP). The samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio compared to other Asian populations. The genetic makeup of the SSIP samples was found to be closely related to South Indians when compared to a panel of well-defined Asian Indians. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and showed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of the relative relatedness between SSIP samples and archaic hominins (Denisovan, Neanderthal) revealed higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations than in SSIP. The SSIP samples clustered distinctly from Europeans in the global population structure analysis with autosomal SNPs. The data resource for these samples is publicly available and is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of the 1,000 Genomes Project. The study provides insights into the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore and contributes to the understanding of the complex genomic diversity present in the Indian subcontinent.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, exhibits intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. However, a rare subset of clinical isolates from Thailand, including strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, exhibit aminoglycoside susceptibility. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) revealed the absence of amrB transcripts in 708a and reduced levels in 2188a and 3799a. Serial passage of 2188a and 3799a on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded mutants that became resistant to other aminoglycosides and macrolides, whereas mutants could not be obtained with 708a. Transcript analysis showed that the resistance of the 2188a and 3799a mutants was due to upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression. The amrAB-oprA operon was found to be missing in 708a due to a large deletion of more than 70 kb of genetic material. This deletion also removed gene clusters for malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis, as well as the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, putative type 1 fimbriae, and secreted chitinase. Despite missing several putative virulence genes, 708a was found to be fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. The study suggests that strain 708a may be a suitable candidate for genetic manipulation experiments using Select Agent compliant antibiotics.
During the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper (Th) cells into Th1 versus Th2 states, researchers observed that transcription factors Tbet and Gata3 are co-expressed in individual cells at high levels, contrary to the expected mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors. This co-expression is distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming and is not positively correlated with cytokine expression in individual cells. However, the expression of cytokines in the entire cell population is still in concert with the expression level of the transcription factor. The study suggests that transcription factors may be responsible for de-condensing the cytokine locus during early activation of CD4 T cells. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors is observed, revealing a weak intracellular network otherwise overruled by strong extracellular cytokine signals. The results indicate that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during the early differentiation process, instructed by extracellular cytokines. This interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression. The study provides insights into the interplay between extracellular cytokines and intracellular transcription factors on the fate specification of single cells during early CD4 T helper cell differentiation.
In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the protein PAQR-2 plays a crucial role in adapting to low temperatures by regulating fatty acid desaturation. PAQR-2 is homologous to the insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for growth at 15°C, a temperature that is usually acceptable for this organism. By screening for novel paqr-2 suppressors, researchers identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. These findings suggest that PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, and Δ9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Genetic evidence supports this model, as paqr-2 suppressors normalize the levels of saturated fatty acids, and low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue the paqr-2 mutant. Furthermore, PAQR-2 is shown to be a transmembrane protein essential for the regulation of Δ9 desaturases during cold adaptation via the modulation of phosphatidylcholine levels. This regulatory axis controls the increase in unsaturated fatty acids during cold adaptation, which is essential for the organism's survival. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in C. elegans and highlight the importance of PAQR-2 in regulating fatty acid metabolism.
The structure of herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions has been studied using electron cryo-tomography, revealing a previously unsuspected feature at the portal vertex. This feature extends across the tegument layer, forming a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. The location of this assembly suggests it plays a role in genome release into the nucleus and is important for virion architecture. The discovery of this feature is supported by evolutionary and structural links between HSV-1 and tailed bacteriophages, which share a common origin with herpesviruses. Tailed bacteriophages have a well-characterized genome packaging and release machinery, which includes a portal and a complex apparatus (the tail) located at the portal vertex. The HSV-1 portal occupies a similar position and has a similar subunit organization as that of tailed bacteriophages, suggesting that equivalent machinery might be present in herpesvirus particles. The tegument layer of HSV-1 virions is a proteinaceous layer that surrounds the capsid and is bounded by a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope. The infectious HSV-1 particle varies in size, but the capsid has a constant diameter of 1250 Å. The capsid is composed of pentons, hexons, and triplexes, which are the main structural features of the icosahedral capsid. The discovery of the tail-like assembly at the portal vertex of HSV-1 virions provides new insights into the structure and function of herpesviruses, which cause a range of diseases from cold sores and chicken pox to congenital defects, blindness, and cancer.
This study investigated the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 (rω-1) on HIV-1 infection in vitro. The results show that SEA can modulate CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and HIV-1 infection. Specifically, SEA was found to block DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 trans-infection by binding to kappa-5, a component of SEA. Additionally, DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2-promoting conditions induced T-cell populations that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X4 infection. This effect was not observed when DCs were exposed to SEA under Th1 or Th1/Th2 (Tmix) promoting conditions. Furthermore, T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs demonstrated a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. The study also found that rω-1, a plant recombinant protein with similar functions to natural ω-1, induced T-cell populations that were less sensitive to HIV-1 R5 infection, associated with reduced IFN-γ and MIP-1β expression, and reduced CCR5 expression. These findings suggest that SEA and rω-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity and may influence disease course in co-infected individuals. The study provides evidence that helminthic infections, such as Schistosoma mansoni, may have a beneficial effect on HIV-1 infection, and highlights the potential for deciphering mechanisms to modulate immune responses beneficial for limiting viral transmission or reducing viral loads.
The article presents a dynamic model that explains the phenomenon of neural-activity-induced shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter. The model accounts for experimental data from wild-type and gene knockout individuals and identifies key mechanisms contributing to ECS shrinkage. These mechanisms include neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride through passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane. The model suggests that the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl− (NKCC1) and Na+/HCO3− (NBC) cotransporters are critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. The authors propose that measuring ECS shrinkage, membrane potential, and ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations in wild-type and knockout individuals, as well as obtaining data on neuronal water, sodium, and chloride uptake during activation, is essential for further understanding this phenomenon. The model framework is considered sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia–neuron interaction models for normal and pathophysiological situations.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression of transposons and repetitive DNA elements is suppressed by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway. This pathway involves RNA Polymerase V ( Pol V ) producing long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) that guide ARGONAUTE4 ( AGO4 ) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. However, the mechanism by which chromatin modifying enzymes are recruited to chromatin is unknown. This study investigated the role of SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, in the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ), the study found that SPT5L/KTF1 binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing downstream of Pol V but independently of 24-nt siRNA. Additionally, SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. The study also showed that binding of both AGO4 and SPT5L/KTF1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of several loci. The results suggest that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for the direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and the role of SPT5L/KTF1 in this process.
This study investigated the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, from ticks to mammals. The authors found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs, as RpoS-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut lumen and form an unusual morphotype, referred to as round bodies, during the later stages of the blood meal. Round body formation is rapidly reversible and appears to be attributable, in part, to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which provides NAD+ for glycolysis. The authors also demonstrated that RpoS is induced during the nymphal blood meal but is not expressed by spirochetes within replete larvae or unfed nymphs, indicating a bipartite regulation of RpoS during the tick phase of the enzootic cycle. Furthermore, the study revealed a previously unsuspected role for RpoSBb in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission and the existence of a default survival mode, round body formation, triggered when spirochetes are unable to produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph. These findings highlight the importance of RpoS-dependent gene expression in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and provide new insights into the tick-phase of the enzootic cycle.
In Arabidopsis, gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) play crucial roles in regulating stamen development. GA promotes stamen filament elongation, pollen maturation, and anther dehiscence by triggering the degradation of DELLA proteins. However, the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development is not well understood. This study reveals that GA acts through JA to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, which are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes. The loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restores the expression of these MYB genes and promotes stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. The myb21-t1 myb24-t1 myb57-t1 triple mutant exhibits a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Genetic and molecular studies demonstrate that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, resulting in increased JA content in young flower buds. Furthermore, exogenous application of GA to GA-deficient plants induces the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 and restores normal floral development. These findings establish a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA, where modulation of the JA pathway by GA is a prerequisite for GA to regulate normal stamen development in Arabidopsis. The study also suggests that other GA-regulated JA-independent factors are necessary for normal stamen filament development.
This study investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in modulating lifespan extension by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous research has shown that the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is essential for longevity phenotypes resulting from DR, but it is unclear whether additional targets of this pathway also modulate lifespan. HIF-1 is a transcription factor complex that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. The study found that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, and its loss-of-function mutant extends lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fails to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. The study also found that increased lifespan by HIF-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. The results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF-1 in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway. The study suggests that HIF-1 acts downstream of the nutrient-responsive TOR-S6K pathway to determine lifespan in C. elegans.
The study investigated the changes in chromatin organization and transcription factor binding in human epidermal keratinocytes as they transition between different functional states, including differentiation and migration. The results show that when keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, they form unique complements of typical enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. These super-enhancers are linked to gene expression that confers functions associated with the respective cell state and are enriched for skin disease sequence variants. The transcription factor GRHL3, which promotes both differentiation and migration, binds preferentially to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes, where it represses the expression of migration inhibitors in collaboration with the transcriptional repressor REST. GRHL3 is also located within super-enhancers that regulate key epidermal differentiation transcription factor genes, and it represses the formation of progenitor and non-keratinocyte super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. The study highlights the reciprocal regulatory relationship between GRHL3 and chromatin domains, including super-enhancers, and suggests that GRHL3 regulates divergent gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching locations of chromatin binding in the context of enhancer landscapes that are distinct for each state. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how a single transcription factor can control distinct gene expression programs under different physiological states within the same cell type.
This study investigates the coevolutionary dynamics between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. Endogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have integrated into the host genome and are transmitted vertically from generation to generation. Some ERVs have been found to interfere with the replication of related exogenous retroviruses, suggesting that they may be used by the host as restriction factors to block pathogenic retroviral infections. The study focuses on the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 enJSRV proviruses in sheep, which have been integrating into the host genome for the last 5-7 million years. Two enJSRV proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication ( ∼ 9, 000 years ago ). Interestingly, a provirus escaping the transdominant enJSRVs has emerged very recently, most likely within the last 200 years. The study suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. The findings indicate that the evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in sheep is a continuous process that has not reached equilibrium.
The diagnosis of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species, relies heavily on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays. However, the sensitivity of standard microscopic procedures is limited, making molecular detection methods more appealing. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of two real-time PCR assays targeting Schistosoma mansoni (Sm) and Schistosoma haematobium (Sh) in excreta, biopsies, and sera for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy. A total of 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis were analyzed using PCR and compared to microscopic examination and serological assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination (HA), and Western Blot (WB) assay. The results showed that PCR significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis, from 4% to 10.5% and from 33.7% to 48.8%, for Sh in urine and Sm in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta (microscopy). The specificity of serum PCR was 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The study suggests that Schistosoma PCRs outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology. Serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration when serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) to estimate conformational energies of large, structurally complex molecules, such as the natural product Archazolid A. Archazolid A is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase produced by the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra. The researchers employed Gaussian process regression, a Bayesian non-parametric ML method, to model the relationship between molecular structure and quantum mechanical (QM) properties. They used a simple molecular representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances to encode the conformations of Archazolid A. The ML model was trained on a dataset of relaxed conformations and their corresponding energies calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory. The results show that the ML model can accurately predict energies of new conformations with a mean absolute error of less than 1 kcal/mol. The study also demonstrates that the predictive variance of the ML model can be used to assess whether a conformation is in the interpolation region, allowing for a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up. This approach has the potential to enable significant speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures, which is particularly relevant for pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The study contributes to the development of innovative ML algorithms that are tightly integrated with molecular dynamics techniques, providing access to long-term simulations of challenging chemical and biomolecular systems.
A new approach for monitoring ebolavirus in wild great apes has been developed through the non-invasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) in fecal samples. This method allows for the identification of gorillas with antibodies to EBOV, with an overall prevalence rate of 10% on average, indicating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was found in gorillas previously thought to be unexposed to EBOV, suggesting that they may have been protected from exposure by topological barriers of transmission. The new approach enables early detection of increased incidence of exposure, identification of immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and tracking of vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Additionally, this method may prove valuable in the development and employment of prospective epidemiological ebolavirus studies in wild great ape populations. The study represents the first time ebolavirus antibodies have been detected in wild great ape fecal samples, carrying important implications for the future management and survival of these primates. This breakthrough has significant implications for the development of intervention strategies to protect apes against future Ebola virus disease (EVD) infections, including vaccination, as ebolavirus vaccines have been shown to protect laboratory monkeys from disease.
A novel type III effector protein, XopL, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, has been identified to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta. This activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates the formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, which is not present in any previously characterized E3 ligase. Mutation of amino acids in the central cavity of the XL-box disrupts E3 ligase activity and prevents XopL-induced plant cell death. The N-terminal region of XopL contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein interaction module for ubiquitination target recognition. The E3 ligase activity of XopL is required to provoke plant cell death, while suppression of PAMP responses solely depends on the N-terminal LRR domain. The unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain within XopL highlights the variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking this eukaryote-specific activity. This study demonstrates that pathogenic bacteria have employed different solutions to fulfill the otherwise typical eukaryote-specific function of E3 ubiquitin ligases during co-evolution with their hosts.
This study investigated the interaction between circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) and B cells in individuals with early acute HIV infection and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T and B cell function. The research used the RV254 cohort of HIV-infected individuals in stages 1/2 and 3 of acute infection. The results showed that cTfh cell function was impaired in individuals treated in stage 3 compared to those in stage 1/2. Cocultures of cTfh and B cells demonstrated lower B cell survival and IgG secretion in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and elevated plasma viral load. Elevated viral load was found to correlate with decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, suggesting a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also observed in the mature B cell compartment, with a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. The study suggests that early ART for acutely HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory. The findings indicate that cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells.
A miniaturized screen of a Schistosoma mansoni serotonergic G protein-coupled receptor (Sm. 5HTR) has been conducted to identify novel classes of parasite-selective inhibitors. The study aimed to address the need for next-generation anthelmintics to combat schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, which has several suboptimal features. The researchers pharmacologically profiled Sm. 5HTR, a downstream modulator of PZQ efficacy, using a miniaturized screening assay compatible with high-content screening. This approach employed a split luciferase-based biosensor sensitive to cellular cAMP levels, resolving the proximal kinetics of GPCR modulation in intact cells. The data revealed a divergent pharmacological signature between Sm. 5HTR and its closest human GPCR homolog, Hs. 5HTR7, supporting the feasibility of optimizing parasitic-selective pharmacophores. New ligands and chemical series with potency and selectivity for Sm. 5HTR over Hs. 5HTR7 were identified in vitro and validated for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. Sm. 5HTR also exhibited an unusual antagonist-evoked inactivation mechanism, a phenomenon also observed at Hs. 5HTR7, enhancing its appeal as a target for anthelmintic ligand design. The study demonstrates the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high-throughput screening format and highlights the promise of Sm. 5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for the development of next-generation anthelmintics.
During embryonic development, the formation of germ layers is crucial for the establishment of the metazoan body plan. The ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm layers must be separated to prevent intermixing, yet the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary also serves as a substratum for mesoderm migration. A new study reveals that localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary is essential for ectoderm-mesoderm segregation. EphrinB/EphB signaling plays a key role in this process, with multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors expressed on each side of the boundary. Forward signaling across the boundary in both directions is necessary for tissue separation, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and RhoA. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation. Instead, it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum. The study suggests that the ephrinB/EphB mechanism of tissue separation may be conserved in other organisms, such as zebrafish and Drosophila, where a cleft-like ectoderm-mesoderm boundary is also observed. The findings have implications for our understanding of germ layer formation and tissue separation during embryonic development.
The study presents a novel approach to classifying children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using multivariate data analysis of markers of oxidative stress and DNA methylation. Blood samples from 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers were analyzed for metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways. Fisher Discriminant Analysis enabled the correct classification of 96.1% of neurotypical participants and 97.6% of the ASD cohort. Furthermore, kernel partial least squares was used to predict adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field, suggesting that the metabolites under consideration are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis and that the statistical analysis used here offers potential for extracting important information from complex biochemical data sets. The study also highlights the importance of incorporating biochemical data into ASD diagnosis to enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses. The multivariate statistical analysis presented in this study provides unprecedented quantitative classification results for separating participants into ASD and neurotypical cohorts based solely on biochemical data.
The article presents a Bayesian geostatistical analysis of leishmaniasis incidence in Brazil over a 10-year period (2001-2010). Leishmaniasis is a significant public health concern in Brazil, with an estimated 350 million people at risk and approximately 2 million cases annually. The study employed Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, with a focus on spatial and temporal patterns. The models were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations for fast approximate Bayesian inference. Bayesian variable selection was used to identify the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of both types of leishmaniasis. The results showed that precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were significant risk factors for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (standard deviation: 7,676) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (standard deviation: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Spatially explicit, high-resolution incidence maps identified priority areas for leishmaniasis control efforts, with the highest numbers of infected people predicted in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The study provides a deeper understanding of the determinants of leishmaniasis in Brazil and highlights the need for targeted control efforts to reduce disease incidence.
In a large cohort study conducted in southern Vietnam, researchers compared the clinical features of dengue in 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue infection. The study found that while the overall clinical picture was similar in both age groups, there were distinct differences in the pattern of complications. Children experienced more frequent and severe signs of vascular leakage and shock, whereas adults were more likely to exhibit bleeding manifestations and organ involvement. Additionally, adults had significantly lower platelet counts than children, with thrombocytopenia being more severe in adults. The study also found that secondary infection, but not serotype, was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia. Notably, the effect of age on platelet count persisted even after recovery, indicating that healthy adults have intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children. These findings highlight the importance of considering age-related physiological differences in the management and treatment of dengue infection. The study's results have implications for the development of guidelines for the use of blood products, such as platelet transfusions, which are becoming increasingly common in dengue-endemic countries despite a lack of evidence supporting their routine use. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the clinical features of dengue in adults and children, which can inform research on disease pathogenesis and improve patient care.
Sooty mangabeys (SM) are natural hosts of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVsmm), which replicates robustly without causing disease. In contrast to HIV infection in humans and SIV infection in macaques, SIVsmm infection in SM is non-pathogenic. A novel CCR5 mutation, a two-base pair deletion (Δ2), was identified in SM, resulting in a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This mutation was present at a 26% frequency in a large SM colony, along with a 3% frequency of a CCR5Δ24 deletion allele that also abrogates surface expression. The mutant allele was also found in wild SM in West Africa. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells displayed a gradient of CCR5 expression across genotype groups, which was highly significant for CD8+ cells. Notably, the prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type animals. SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro, and Envs from both CCR5-null and wild-type infected animals used CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1 in addition to CCR5 in transfected cells. These findings suggest that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM, which may enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of restricted CCR5 expression.
The co-existence of transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor MEF2 complexes influences tumor aggressiveness in leiomyosarcomas (LMS). MEF2 transcription factors (TFs) can support both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on their interaction with co-activators or co-repressors. These interactions regulate histone modifications associated with gene activation or repression, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a critical role in generating a MEF2 repressive environment. In LMS, high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. The knockout of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells by restoring the transcriptional proficiency of some MEF2-target loci. HDAC9 also coordinates the demethylation of H3K4me3 at the promoters of MEF2-target genes. Notably, class IIa HDACs do not bind all the regulatory elements bound by MEF2, allowing for the coexistence of actively transcribed and strongly repressed MEF2-target genes. These repressed genes are poised in terms of chromatin signature. The study identifies class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, as potential druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in LMS. The findings suggest that LMS can be clustered into two groups based on MEF2 dysfunction, with one group exhibiting low proliferation and low MEF2 levels, and the other group showing high MEF2 and class IIa HDAC levels, which is associated with poor patient survival.
Hydrophobins are a group of proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play a crucial role in their interaction with the environment and have potential applications in nanotechnology. This study used a combination of protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to investigate the surface structure of films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by Trichoderma reesei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry, but experimental data show P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. Computational simulations indicate the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three-protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film suggests that this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films. The study provides a detailed atomic resolution picture of the assembled structure of hydrophobin films at the air-water interface. The unique macroscopic properties of hydrophobin films arise from cooperative effects in the stabilization of the film resulting from interactions between interlocking proteins in the structured surface network. The findings have implications for both biological and nanotechnological applications of hydrophobins.
The study reports the functional characterization of threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) from Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis. Recombinant LdThrRS was expressed in E. coli and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that LdThrRS is localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in Leishmania promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and attenuated infectivity. These mutants were also more susceptible to inhibition by the known ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. An in silico-generated structural model of LdThrRS was compared to human ThrRS, showing considerable similarity. Borrelidin displayed a strong affinity for LdThrRS (KD: 0.04 μM) and inhibited the aminoacylation activity of recombinant LdThrRS (IC50: 0.06 μM). Furthermore, borrelidin inhibited the promastigotes stage of parasites (IC50: 21 μM). The study demonstrates that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival and is a potential target for drug discovery efforts. The results suggest that LdThrRS could be targeted by small drug-like molecules with strong affinity, making it a promising new class of targets in antileishmanial drug discovery.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune receptor RIG-I through the presence of a 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp) on the viral RNA in association with a 3′ poly-U/UC tract. A detailed structure-function analysis of RIG-I and poly-U/UC RNA interactions revealed that the 34 nucleotide poly-uridine "core" of this sequence tract is essential for RIG-I activation. Interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences in the RNA are also required to achieve optimal RIG-I signal induction. 5′-ppp poly-U/UC RNA variants that stimulated strong RIG-I activation efficiently bound purified RIG-I protein in vitro, and RNA interaction with both the repressor domain and helicase domain of RIG-I was required to activate signaling. The poly-U/UC U-core sequence conferred non-self recognition of the RNA and innate immune signaling by RIG-I when appended to 5′-ppp RNA that lacks PAMP activity. HCV poly-U/UC RNA variants that strongly activated RIG-I signaling triggered potent anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo using a mouse model of PAMP signaling. These studies define a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection.
This study investigated the role of eosinophils and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in promoting the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. Eosinophils were found to be necessary for normal larval growth, and IL-4 competent eosinophils were sufficient to support growth in the absence of adaptive immunity. Gene expression in infected muscle tissue indicated a regenerative response and a shift in energy source. Eosinophils suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in nurse cells, consistent with enhanced glucose uptake and glycogen storage by larvae. The data suggest that eosinophils promote larval growth through an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. This interaction between parasite and host facilitates worm growth by co-opting an innate host cell response. Further experimentation is needed to establish the direct mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 enhances glucose uptake in host cells. The study also found that the effect of eosinophils on larval growth depends on their IL-4 competence and is independent of ILC2. Transfer of IL-4-/- eosinophils failed to improve larval growth in PHIL/Rag1-/- mice, supporting the role of IL-4 in eosinophil-mediated larval growth.
Genome-wide replication timing studies have suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of large domains of coordinated origin firing separated by originless transition regions. However, a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in HeLa cells contradicts this view. DNA combing in HeLa cells sorted into four temporal compartments of S phase shows that replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase, with a mean of 0. 7 kb/min and a maximum of 2. 0 kb/min. Multi-scale analysis of a genome-wide replication timing profile reveals a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min. This suggests that HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Instead, temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase. Replication timing gradients are set by the delay and spacing between successive origin firings rather than by the velocity of single forks. Activation of internal origins in a specific temporal transition region is directly demonstrated by DNA combing of the IGH locus in HeLa cells. These findings are corroborated by analysis of published origin maps in HeLa cells and replication timing and DNA combing data in several other cell types, with the exception of embryonic stem cells where regions of unidirectional fork progression seem more abundant.
The article explores the concept of slowness as an objective for spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) in the nervous system. The authors propose that the ability to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables, such as perspective or lighting conditions, can be attributed to the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. They investigate how this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. The authors first demonstrate that slow feature analysis (SFA), an algorithm based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, another implementation of slowness learning. They then show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by STDP with a specific learning window. The authors derive STDP learning windows that implement SFA and the "trace rule" and find that the resulting learning windows are compatible with physiological data in terms of shape and timescale. Their analysis suggests that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics. The theory indicates that irreversible input statistics may generate oscillatory weight dynamics, offering a novel interpretation for the functional role of STDP in physiological neurons.
In a study on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), researchers have identified a previously unrecognized phenomenon called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells when exposed to cancer therapy. The study used a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer phenotypically diverse NSCLC cells with mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. The researchers monitored the growth dynamics of mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry were used to characterize the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures, revealing that the combination of wild-type and mutant cells in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug-sensitive cells despite drug pressure. This growth was attributed to a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values of the cells. The study also used an ex vivo human tumor model to determine that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates with prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. These findings suggest that profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy, and that non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells plays a significant role in drug resistance. The study highlights the importance of understanding how phenotypically distinct cells within the same tumor interact to promote resistance to therapy.
A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted in Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania, to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. A total of 1,228 participants above the age of 5 years were randomly selected from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude of residence, and ownership of domestic mammals. The seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae was found to be 67.9%, ranging from 42.8% to 91.4% among the nine sites. Multivariable analysis revealed associations between SFG-seropositivity and age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. The study suggests that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the more rural population of Mbeya Region, and its spread may be limited by temperature and higher elevation. The findings are compatible with previous descriptions and add information on risk factors for SFG rickettsioses in southwestern Tanzania. The study highlights the need for further research to examine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses and to determine the causative pathogens in a prospective study. The results also suggest that SFG rickettsiae may contribute to the disease burden in the population, particularly in rural areas.
This study investigates the role of oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, in the innate immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm commonly used as a model organism in biomedical research. The researchers conducted an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify regulators of innate immune defense genes and found that two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases, which synthesize oleate, are essential for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. The study shows that C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Serratia marcescens. However, the addition of exogenous oleate rescues this susceptibility, indicating that oleate is necessary for innate immune activation and pathogen defense. The researchers also found that oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation on its own, suggesting that it acts in conjunction with other factors to promote immune responses. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that oleate and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as γ-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, affect immune effector expression and pathogen resistance through distinct mechanisms. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the importance of oleate in the innate immune response of C. elegans and suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Scientists have identified a novel compound, PC1, that selectively inhibits the growth of certain bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens, by targeting guanine riboswitches. Guanine riboswitches regulate the expression of genes involved in purine metabolism, which is essential for bacterial survival. PC1, a pyrimidine compound, binds to guanine riboswitches and causes transcription attenuation of the downstream open reading frame, leading to bactericidal activity. This activity is only observed in bacteria that use guanine riboswitches to control the expression of the guaA gene, which codes for a GMP synthetase. Notably, PC1 exhibits bactericidal activity even when bacteria are grown in a rich medium, suggesting that it targets a specific metabolic pathway. In a mouse model, administration of PC1 was shown to reduce Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. The study demonstrates the potential of using existing structural knowledge to design novel antibiotics that target guanine riboswitches. This approach may provide a new strategy for developing powerful and selective antimicrobial compounds, particularly against community-acquired bacterial infections. The findings also highlight the importance of guanine riboswitches in bacterial metabolism and their potential as targets for antibiotic development.
The study investigated how gaze influences the construction of mental space during navigation in primates by examining navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys searching a virtual reality maze for a reward. The results show that hippocampal cells sensitive to place also responded to variables such as head direction, point of gaze, or task context. Many cells fired at the sight (and in anticipation) of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal’s logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. The findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. This conjunctive type of coding appears ubiquitous across mammals, consistent with the encoding of task-related demands by hippocampal neurons in rodents. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the variables controlling the activity of hippocampal cells, bridging the gap between studies in rodents and primates, including humans, collected in real and virtual environments. The results suggest that the counterpart of place cells in primates is expressed as activity related to point of gaze in conjunction with other variables essential to navigation, such as position and identity of visual elements at key instants of trajectory planning.
The article presents a spatial analysis of gene expression patterns at the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in vertebrate development. The MHB is characterized by a well-defined pattern of locally restricted gene expression domains, which is established and maintained by a regulatory network between several transcription and secreted factors. A Boolean analysis of the spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB reveals key regulatory interactions in this network. The analysis predicts a maintaining, rather than inducing, effect of Fgf8 on Wnt1 expression, which is experimentally validated using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures. The results show that Fgf8 maintains, but does not induce, ectopic Wnt1 expression in these explants. This finding, combined with previously validated interactions, allows for the construction of a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB. Analyses of Boolean, differential equation, and reaction-diffusion models of this network confirm that it is able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB as well as time-courses of expression patterns under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks, and that the spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help to understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.
Theileria annulata, an apicomplexan parasite, transforms infected host cells, inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized cell population. The parasite develops into a schizont, which remains tethered to host cell microtubules (MTs) and engages with the cell's astral and central spindle MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis to secure its distribution between the two daughter cells. The molecular mechanism by which the schizont recruits and stabilizes host cell MTs is not known. The plus ends of growing MTs, which are dynamic and constantly switching between phases of growth and shrinkage, are thought to provide the first point of contact with the parasite. The end-binding protein 1 (EB1), a central component of the MT plus end protein interaction network, is a key regulator of host cell MT dynamics. The schizont recruits EB1 through its surface protein p104, which contains a consensus SxIP motif that binds to EB1. This interaction is cell cycle regulated and is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB1 via a bona-fide SxIP motif. The findings provide new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton. The schizont's association with host cell MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis is crucial for its persistence in the transformed host cell, and the interaction with EB1 is essential for the distribution of the schizont between the two daughter cells during cytokinesis.
In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, broken replication forks result in DNA breaks that are normally repaired via homologous recombination or break-induced replication ( BIR ). Research has shown that mild insufficiency in the replicative ligase Cdc9 leads to a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and longer telomeres. This telomere lengthening requires functional telomerase, the core DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad53, and the components of the BIR repair pathway – Rad51, Rad52, Pol32, and Pif1. The Mec1-Rad53 induced phosphorylation of Pif1, previously found necessary for inhibition of telomerase at double strand breaks, is also important for the role of Pif1 in BIR and telomere elongation in cdc9-1 cells. Two other mutants with impaired DNA replication, cdc44-5 and rrm3Δ, exhibit a similar long telomere phenotype dependent on the Pif1 phosphorylation locus. The study proposes a model in which the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity and leads to telomere lengthening. The DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes telomere-stabilizing telomere extension while repressing deleterious de novo telomere addition events at DNA breaks. This mechanism may explain previous reports of constitutive activation of Rad53 and longer telomeres in rrm3 mutants and cdc44-5 cells.
A novel diagnostic tool for onchocerciasis, an infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, has been developed using a luciferase immunoprecipitation system ( LIPS ). This system utilizes four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens : Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1. The LIPS assay was tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections. The results showed that antibody responses to the four different Onchocerca volvulus antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The use of a mixture of the four antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format ( QLIPS ) showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The QLIPS format had the best performance with 100% sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84%, and 93% for distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus from Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis-infected sera, respectively. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool for diagnosing individual Onchocerca volvulus infections and for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus infection.
A 54-month iron-folic acid and de-worming program was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. The program involved weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming. A prospective cohort design was used to assess the impact of the program on mean hemoglobin levels and the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helminth infection. The study enrolled 389 women aged 16-45 years prior to the intervention. After 54 months, 76% of participants were taking the iron-folic acid supplement and 95% had taken the most recent deworming treatment. The mean hemoglobin level increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, and anemia prevalence decreased from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. The results indicate that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections, maintaining them below the level of public health concern.
The Epstein-Barr Virus Glycoprotein gp150 Forms an Immune-Evasive Glycan Shield at the Surface of Infected Cells
    The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) exploits immune evasion strategies to persist and produce virus in the face of primed immunity. A novel, broadly acting immunoevasin, gp150, is expressed during the late phase of viral replication and inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and the non-classical, lipid-presenting CD1d molecules. The mechanism of gp150-mediated T-cell escape does not depend on degradation of the antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp150’s cytoplasmic tail. Instead, gp150 creates a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen through its abundant glycosylation. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. B cells infected with a gp150-null mutant EBV displayed rescued levels of surface antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d, supporting an important role for iNKT cells next to classical T cells in fighting EBV infection. EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle. This mechanism is novel in herpesvirus biology and further supports the notion that herpesviruses use diverse ways to achieve escape not only from T cells, but also from iNKT cell immunity. EBV gp150 is encoded by the BDLF3 gene, which is unique to EBV and the closely related Rhesus lymphocryptovirus (LCV). The study provides evidence that gp150 shields the recognition of surface molecules in a glycan-dependent manner, representing a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses.
The translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) is a conserved protein among all pathogenic chlamydial species, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia caviae, and Chlamydia muridarum. A peptide antiserum specific to the Tarp actin binding domain was generated and shown to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro and Chlamydia trachomatis entry in vivo, indicating an essential role for Tarp in chlamydial pathogenesis. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from multiple chlamydial species and Chlamydia trachomatis serovars revealed multiple putative actin binding sites. In vitro polymerization assays demonstrated that Chlamydial Tarps harbored variable numbers of actin binding sites and promoted actin nucleation. These findings indicate that Tarp-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. The Tarp actin binding domain is present in all examined strains and is essential for Chlamydia trachomatis invasion. The mechanism of Tarp actin nucleation appears to be distinct from known eukaryotic actin nucleators. Furthermore, a peptide antiserum targeting the actin binding domain prevented Tarp-mediated actin nucleation and reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection when delivered into host cells. These results suggest that the actin nucleating activity of Tarp is required for Chlamydia trachomatis invasion.
A novel procedure, the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique, has been developed for the precise quantification of Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This technique is essential for determining the prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum in mammalian hosts, which is crucial for calculating transmission rates and assessing environmental contamination. The FEA-SD method involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy, allowing for improved visualization of S. japonicum eggs. This technique is particularly useful for identifying and quantifying S. japonicum eggs in fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and carabao (water buffalo) in the Philippines. The FEA-SD method removes nearly 70% of debris from the fecal samples, rendering the remaining debris translucent and facilitating accurate microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs. This technique has been shown to be as efficient as real-time PCR (qPCR) for determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement. The FEA-SD method has the potential to be a valuable surveillance tool for animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity or where schistosomiasis japonica is suspected to be eliminated following control efforts.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) are the first identified causes of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin B, form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1(I) chain and has cis/trans isomerase activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for the structural stability of collagen, but its absence may disrupt protein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. A novel mouse model, Lepre1H662A/H662A, was generated with a knock-in mutation in the catalytic domain of P3H1, inactivating its 3-hydroxylase activity and causing loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the collagen α1(I) chain of bone and a reduction to 9% 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the α1(II) chain of cartilage. The mice showed decreased trabecular bone mass but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. This new model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The results suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The findings highlight the importance of this complex in collagen modification and maintenance of bone mass.
The P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. This invasion is associated with a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype, characterized by abnormal phenotypes such as sterility, in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains. A survey of 181 strains revealed that approximately 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Genomic and transcriptomic data indicate that the P-element is responsible for this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype. The invasion of the P-element in D. simulans occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously across three continents, with strains containing the P-element being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Strains collected from the latter phase of the invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype. In comparison to D. melanogaster, the spread of the P-element in D. simulans is surprisingly fast. Both D. simulans and D. melanogaster have evolved to suppress the dysgenesis phenotype by the end of the invasion, suggesting strong selection to ameliorate the P-element's effects. The study highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish elements and the rapid adaptation of species to mitigate their impact.
The use of rhodamine B to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti for mark-release-recapture experiments and estimating the efficacy of sterile male releases has been investigated. Rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, was administered via sugar-feeding to males at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% (w/v) in 50% honey solutions during free flight. The results showed that all concentrations produced >95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days of feeding, with 0.4 and 0.8% solutions producing the longest-lasting body marking. Importantly, rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness and proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males. These results suggest that rhodamine B is a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) control strategies. Additionally, rhodamine B marking is a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods. Compared to other methods, such as PCR and stable isotope semen labeling, rhodamine B marking is less expensive and less time-consuming.
Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock by binding to the T cell receptor and major histocompatibility class II molecule on antigen-presenting cells. However, a new study reveals that superantigens must also bind directly to the CD28 homodimer interface on T cells to elicit toxicity. CD28 is a costimulatory molecule that plays a crucial role in the immune response, and its interaction with superantigens is essential for the induction of Th1 cytokine genes that mediate lethal shock. The study shows that blocking access of superantigens to CD28 is sufficient to block lethal toxic shock, and that peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface can inhibit the induction of Th1 cytokines and protect mice from lethal superantigen exposure. Furthermore, the study identifies a conserved β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in superantigens that is essential for binding to CD28. Structural analysis reveals that CD28 can be accommodated as a third receptor in the quaternary complex formed by the superantigen, T cell receptor, and major histocompatibility class II molecule. The findings of this study highlight the critical role of CD28 as a receptor for superantigen toxins and broaden the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms.
The Wnt/Tcf1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Unlike its mitogenic effect in somatic cells, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway triggers an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs through the activation of the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus. The Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. This effect is dependent on β-catenin and Tcf1, but not Tcf3, indicating specialized and non-overlapping functions of Tcf/Lef factors in mESCs. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in the downregulation of some cell differentiation genes, while the expression of pluripotency genes remains unperturbed. Tcf1 recruitment is enriched at the promoters of cell cycle genes, including the Ink4/Arf locus. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibition or β-catenin stabilization transcriptionally regulates the expression of the Ink4 and Arf family members in a Tcf3-independent manner. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces an increased expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as the tumour suppressors Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b. These findings demonstrate that the Wnt/Tcf1 pathway restricts embryonic stem cell cycle through the activation of the Ink4/Arf locus.
This study investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the immune response to dengue virus (DENV) infection. pDCs are innate immune cells that produce interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and express membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL) in response to viral exposure. The study found that pDCs from mild dengue patients exhibited higher frequencies of mTRAIL expression compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL were also increased in mild dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. In vitro experiments showed that exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDCs and relocalized TRAIL from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-2-induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDCs, suggesting that endocytosis is involved in DENV-2 activation of pDCs. Coculture of pDCs with DENV-2-infected monocytes revealed a decrease in antigen detection, which was also observed after exogenous IFN-α treatment. The study suggests that pDCs play an antiviral role in DENV-2 infection and that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may contribute to the outcome of the disease. The results indicate that pDC activation is associated with mild dengue fever and that IFN-α and TRAIL levels are positively correlated with pDC activation.
Differences in Reactivation of Tuberculosis Induced from Anti-TNF Treatments Are Based on Bioavailability in Granulomatous Tissue
    A computational study investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in both active and latent phases of infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been linked to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) in animal studies. The study extended previous mathematical models to examine the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) in TB control and pathology. Virtual clinical trials (VCTs) were simulated to analyze the effects of two commonly used anti-TNF therapies: anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion. The results showed that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor causing reactivation of latent infection, and that sTNF, even at low levels, is essential for controlling infection. The study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the reduction of inflammation with the need to maintain resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation. The findings also indicate that anti-TNF therapy will likely lead to numerous incidents of primary TB if used in areas where exposure to Mtb is likely. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of action of anti-TNF treatments and the role of TNF in TB control and pathology.
This study investigated inter-population differences in retrogene loss and expression in humans using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and RNA-Seq data from the Geuvadis Consortium. The researchers developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome and experimentally confirmed the existence of 193 retroduplication variations ( RDVs ), the majority of which resulted from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported. The study found that the frequency of retrocopy absence was low for the majority of retrogenes, with only a few showing absence in more than 50% of individuals. In contrast, new retropositions were expected to have absence close to 100% of alleles in at least some populations. The researchers also examined retrocopy expression levels and found 9 retrogenes that underwent statistically significant differential expression between populations. Furthermore, they experimentally confirmed the expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals. The expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of these retrocopies may suggest some functionality. The study highlights the potential of retrocopy polymorphisms as markers for human population history and ongoing evolutionary processes, and provides new insights into the functional implications of retrocopy variation.
This study investigated the relationship between the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain and the inflammatory response to praziquantel treatment in pigs with neurocysticercosis (NCC). The researchers analyzed 196 histological specimens from 11 pigs naturally infected with T. solium cysticerci, comparing the inflammatory responses to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues. The results showed that cysticerci in the parenchyma provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation after treatment compared to those in the meninges or corticomeningeal locations. The inflammatory score (ISC) of meningeal cysticerci was not significantly affected by treatment, while the increase in ISC score in corticomeningeal cysticerci was correlated to the extent of the cysticercus adjacent to the brain parenchyma. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. The inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to parenchymal cysticerci. These findings suggest that the location of T. solium cysticerci in the brain influences the inflammatory response to praziquantel treatment, which may explain why subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC. The study highlights the importance of considering the location of cysticerci in the brain when developing treatment strategies for NCC.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 communities in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin for trachoma control had previously been implemented. The study aimed to investigate the presence of yaws, a treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, in these communities. Children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled, and samples were collected for treponemal serology and lesion PCR. A total of 90 children with 98 lesions were enrolled, and syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities, which had previously been treated for trachoma. The results suggest that H. ducreyi may be associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. The study highlights the need for integration of diagnostic testing into both pre- and post-MDA surveillance systems to better inform yaws control programs. The findings have implications for the World Health Organization's (WHO) yaws eradication campaign, which relies on mass distribution of azithromycin.
Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in treating HIV infection, the persistence of the virus in the body remains a significant challenge. T cell homeostasis is a major driver of HIV persistence, and cytokines involved in regulating memory T cell homeostasis trigger the Jak-STAT pathway. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, were evaluated for their ability to block the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. The study found that Jak inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells. Additionally, Jak inhibitors inhibited γ-C receptor cytokine (IL-15)-induced viral reactivation from latent stores, preventing the transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells. The study demonstrated that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence in vivo, and that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of γ-C cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15) ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets in vitro and ex vivo. The results suggest that Jak inhibitors represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence, and that specific blockade of these events may be integrated into future curative strategies.
In a study on Spodoptera exigua larvae infected with the species-specific baculovirus SeMNPV and the generalist baculovirus AcMNPV, gene expression analysis revealed that immune-related genes are down-regulated after infection. Contrary to the expected host transcriptional shut-off, a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes were observed in the first 36 hours following infection. The down-regulation of immune-related genes was confirmed in the larval gut, where the expression of these genes affects the status of gut microorganisms responsible for growth and development functions. An increase in gut bacterial load was observed after infection, suggesting that the down-regulation of immune-related genes may be a consequence of viral infection. Subsequent experiments showed that gut bacteria enhance baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion. The study suggests that the host immune response processes and pathways are affected by baculoviruses, and that gut microbiota play a significant role in viral infection. The findings indicate that the role of gut microbiota cannot be ignored when studying virus infection, and that baculoviruses may manipulate host immune responses through mechanisms such as microRNAs that target both viral and host genes. The study extends previous works on the differential expression of host genes after infection with baculoviruses in other lepidopteran species.
Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in understanding the process of apomixis, a type of asexual reproduction in plants that produces seeds without fertilization. Apomixis is of great interest in agriculture due to its potential to improve crop yields and reduce the need for fertilization. A key component of apomixis is apomeiosis, a deregulation of meiosis that results in a mitotic-like division. Researchers have isolated and characterized a novel gene that controls the entry into the second meiotic division. By combining this gene with two others that affect meiotic processes, they created a genotype called MiMe, in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis. This results in the production of functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. The MiMe genotype and apomeiosis phenotype are a crucial step towards understanding and engineering apomixis. The study found that MiMe plants undergo a mitotic-like division instead of a normal meiotic division, without affecting subsequent sexual processes. The gametes produced by MiMe plants retain the mother plant's heterozygosity for every genetic marker tested, confirming that they are genetically identical to the mother plant. This discovery has significant implications for the development of apomixis in crops, potentially leading to improved crop yields and reduced fertilization requirements.
The prioritization of disease-causing genes is a significant challenge in the post-genomic era. Current methods exploit protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify candidate disease-causing genes. However, these methods rely on a static picture of human PPIs, neglecting the fact that diseases impact specific tissues with distinct PPI networks. This study addresses this limitation by integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information to construct tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 healthy human tissues. The results show that tissue-specific PPI networks significantly improve gene prioritization accuracy compared to generic PPI networks. Furthermore, they enable the prediction of novel disease-tissue associations, highlighting sub-clinical tissue effects that may be missed in early detection. The study demonstrates that incorporating tissue-specific expression information into gene prioritization schemes markedly improves prediction accuracy, particularly when focusing on cases where the disease-related gene is expressed in the associated tissue. The tissue-specific variant of the algorithm yields higher area under the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) and gives the correct gene a higher ranking than the original variant more often than not. The study also extends the method to infer new disease-tissue associations by constructing tissue-specific PPI networks and utilizing them for gene prioritization. The results show that the tissue-specific approach enhances the performance of the gene prioritization algorithm.
The article presents a two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, as well as varying selection pressures and dominance values depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. The model is used to investigate the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimize the spread of resistance. The results show that both strategies can last over 500 mosquito generations ( approximately 40 years ) in 24% of runs, while in those runs where resistance had spread to high levels by 500 generations, 56% favoured sequential use and 44% favoured mixtures. The model suggests that mixtures are favoured when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low, while sequential deployment is more robust when insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes. The results also indicate that resistance to an insecticide always spreads slower if it is used in a mixture, although this may not be sufficient to outperform sequential use. The study emphasizes the importance of designing and implementing a flexible modelling strategy to investigate the spread of insecticide resistance in vector populations and to identify vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance.
The sialome of Rhodnius neglectus, a vector of Chagas disease, was investigated using next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. A total of 4,230 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were deposited in GenBank, from which 636 CDS of proteins of putative secretory nature were extracted. Proteomic analysis confirmed 73 of these proteins. The sialome of R. neglectus was characterized, revealing the presence of serine protease transcripts, as well as ubiquitous protein families such as lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. Metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families were less abundant. The study aimed to catalog the transcripts of R. neglectus salivary glands with probable function in hematophagy using RNAseq and mass spectrometry. The secreted class was organized into subclasses, including previously known gene families present in hematophagous saliva, such as lipocalin and antigen-5, as well as gene families not commonly reported in triatomine saliva, such as serine protease and disintegrin. Notably, only one serine protease was detected by proteomic analysis, despite a high number of transcript reads assigned to this subclass. The study provides new insights into the sialome of R. neglectus and contributes to the understanding of hematophagy and the complex interplay between vectors and their vertebrate hosts.
This study investigated the genomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to different soil bacteria to predict environment-specific genetic effects on life history traits. The researchers used transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to various bacteria isolated from grassland nematodes or soils. Many of the regulated genes are predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting that similar genes could influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems. Mutations that inactivate 21 of the identified genes were used to show that most contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. The study also demonstrated that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, can have a large effect on gene expression, with important consequences for fitness. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments. This suggests that differential expression is predictive of functional importance. The study used C. elegans as a model for understanding the responses of bactivorous soil nematodes to their bacterial environment, as it is related to many relevant nematode taxa and is an excellent model for understanding naturally occurring nematode-bacterial interactions.
Gene expression noise plays a crucial role in the robust organization of the early mammalian blastocyst, a critical event in mammalian embryo development. The blastocyst consists of an inner cell mass ( ICM ) surrounded by a trophoectoderm ( TE ), a shell of cells that later form extraembryonic structures. A multi-scale, stochastic modeling approach was used to investigate the design principles responsible for the robust establishment of these structures. The results suggest that stochasticity in the expression of critical genes promotes cell plasticity and has a critical role in accurately organizing the developing mouse blastocyst. Asymmetry in the levels of noise variation of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while ameliorating the potentially detrimental effects of stochasticity. Furthermore, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, creating a time window during which each cell can continually read its environment and adjust its fate. The results indicate that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. The study also found that the amount of expression noise within embryos is consistent with the amounts required to provide a benefit, suggesting that noise-induced plasticity has the capacity to improve organization. The findings support the hypothesis that gene expression noise has a substantial positive influence on TE/ICM organization and adds significant robustness for the correct structural arrangement of mouse blastocysts.
The study investigated the ability of germline antibody gene segments to encode polyspecific antibodies, which can bind to multiple antigens. It was found that the structural flexibility of germline gene-encoded antibodies allows for promiscuous binding to diverse antigens, and that the binding affinity and specificity for a particular epitope typically increase as antibody genes acquire somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. The study used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing the residues that enable polyspecificity. The study demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition and identified key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework that are critical contributors for polyspecificity in germline antibodies. The results suggest that computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding. The study also found that designing antibodies for polyspecificity recovered germline gene-encoded sequences, while designing antibodies for monospecificity to a single target returned sequences similar to the mature antibody. This trend increased in strength with the number of somatic mutations accumulated.
Locusts exhibit two interconvertible behavioral phases: solitarious and gregarious. While solitarious individuals are repelled by other locusts, gregarious insects are attracted to conspecifics and can form large aggregations such as marching hopper bands. Biological experiments have shown that crowding biases conversion towards the gregarious form. To understand the formation of marching locust hopper bands, a partial integrodifferential equation model was constructed to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. The model incorporates the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level. Stability analysis revealed conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large-scale transition to the gregarious phase. A model reduction enabled quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and the time scale for this to occur. Numerical simulations provided descriptions of the aggregation's structure and revealed transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. The model predicts aggregation and mass gregarization, suggesting several possible future biological experiments. A continuum mathematical model of behavioral phase for interacting gregarious and solitarious locusts was constructed to investigate the onset of an outbreak. The model classified and quantified group dynamics in wide swaths of parameter space, revealing that in the limit of low densities, both phases are uniformly spread and the solitarious phase dominates. For sufficiently large populations, a dense, traveling patch of gregarious locusts suddenly emerges, while solitarious locusts become more and more scarce. The critical density beyond which the gregarious group forms was calculated, as well as the final ratio of gregarious to solitarious locusts. Behavioral state is plastic and strongly dependent on local population density, with gregarization dominating when large numbers of locusts gather at the same site, potentially leading to a destructive outbreak.
The study characterizes a structural intermediate of flavivirus membrane fusion using tick-borne encephalitis virus as a model. Flaviviruses possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) that mediates fusion at acidic pH, undergoing a conformational change from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. By exposing virions to alkaline pH instead of acidic pH, the researchers were able to trap the particles in an intermediate conformation where the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to membrane merger. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. The use of nonphysiological conditions allowed the dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, where membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion. The study demonstrates that the flavivirus fusion process can be separated into two discrete stages by the application of alkaline pH, which triggers the formation of a prehairpin intermediate and its interaction with target membranes but not hairpin formation and membrane fusion.
This study investigates the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. By comparing Red List data for the British and South African floras, the authors demonstrate that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, contradicting a simple, trait-based model of extinction. A comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape flora reveals a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks, but the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades, the authors suggest that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. They find that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. The results have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions like the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. The study highlights the need for detailed knowledge of interspecific phylogenetic relationships within higher taxa to estimate the true impact of plant extinctions on the loss of evolutionary history across the angiosperm tree-of-life.
Biomedical research has identified Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1 as two new interacting proteins of Dectin-1, a major phagocytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity. Dectin-1 plays a crucial role in the phagocytosis of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans by cells of the innate immune system. BTK and Vav1 are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae, but are absent from mature phagosomes. They localize to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. BTK and Vav1 colocalize with the lipid PI(3,4,5)P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol (DAG), which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, researchers show that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lack BTK or Vav1 show reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild-type mice. This study identifies an important role for BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C. albicans.
This study aimed to identify the environmental factors and areas favorable to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) transmission to both cattle and humans in Madagascar, as well as human behaviors that contribute to human infections. An integrated analysis of environmental, cattle, and human serological data was conducted using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). The results showed that humid environments and high cattle density were positively associated with cattle and human seroprevalence rates, suggesting that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission. The study also highlighted the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle. Furthermore, frequent contact with raw milk was found to contribute to human infection. The analysis suggested that vectorial transmission probably occurs in both cattle and humans in the at-risk humid environments of the western, north-western, and eastern-coast areas, where Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes are present. The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematical modeling. The study provides new insights into RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar and highlights the need to adapt control measures to the specific eco-climatic areas and transmission routes.
The transmission of prion states between non-identical proteins, such as between homologous proteins from different species, is often inefficient. This inefficiency is attributed to sequence differences in prion proteins, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To explore the nature of transmission barriers, researchers used a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system. The prion form of Rnq1, [PIN+], is common in wild and laboratory yeast strains and facilitates the appearance of other prions. The prion domain of Rnq1 carries four discrete QN-rich regions, which can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants revealed that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission. However, transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength, even in the absence of amino acid mismatches in transmitting regions. This suggests that multiple prion determinants in complex prion domains act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and transmission barriers are determined by this cooperative fold. The study highlights the complexity of prion transmission and the importance of understanding the cooperative interactions between prion determinants. The findings have implications for our understanding of prion biology and the mechanisms of prion transmission.
The article introduces a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genetic analysis using deep learning. This approach leverages multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from input summary statistics to output population genetic parameters of interest. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning for population genetic inference and feature learning by applying it to the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography in Drosophila melanogaster. The method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection without sequential steps for these two factors. The authors apply their method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia, inferring both overall demography and regions of the genome under selection. The results reveal many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, soft sweeps, and balancing selection, with soft sweeps and balancing selection occurring more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Additionally, the demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme. The authors also discuss the potential of deep learning as a new inference framework for population genomic analysis, highlighting its ability to distinguish informative summary statistics from uninformative ones and its potential to accommodate more complex models than existing techniques.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6 and E7 disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway by impairing the localization and de-ubiquitination of FancD2. Cells expressing E6/E7 are hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although E6/E7 activate the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, they inhibit the completion of the repair by multiple mechanisms. E6/E7 impair FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSBs), which hinders the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs. Additionally, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, an essential process for effective ICL repair. Delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination is associated with increased chromatin retention of FancD2, hindering USP1 de-ubiquitinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. E6-mediated p53 degradation does not affect the cell cycle-specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting FancD2 de-ubiquitination. Furthermore, E6 reduces the expression and foci formation of Palb2, a repair protein downstream of FancD2. These findings reveal unique mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
The Southern Chiapas focus of onchocerciasis in Mexico has undergone semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin since 1998. In 2003, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 50 communities, and an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen in 2009. An in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessment was conducted in six sentinel communities that had undergone two rounds of ivermectin treatment per year and three extra-sentinel communities that had undergone four rounds of ivermectin treatment per year. The results showed that none of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s.l. black flies collected during the dry season of 2011 contained Onchocerca volvulus parasite DNA, indicating an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-ULCI) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Serological assays conducted on 4,230 children aged 5 years and under revealed that 2/4,230 individuals were exposed to O. volvulus (0.05%; one-sided 95% confidence interval = 0.08%). These findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community. The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas aims to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by O. volvulus infection and eventually eliminate transmission of the parasite in all 13 foci in Latin America. The population at risk in the Southern Chiapas focus comprised about 21% of the total at-risk population in the Americas.
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cell cytosol. A transcriptional activator known as PrfA regulates gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells. However, the signal that stimulates PrfA activation has not been defined. This study identifies a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, secreted by L. monocytogenes that enhances the escape of the bacteria from host cell vacuoles and may facilitate PrfA activation. The pPplA pheromone is generated via the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. Bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrfA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests that the pPplA peptide may signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the confines of the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol. The pPplA peptide pheromone is released by L. monocytogenes following its cleavage and processing from the secretion signal sequence of the PplA lipoprotein, and its production enhances L. monocytogenes escape from host cell vacuoles and is required for full bacterial virulence.
This study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, overcomes reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) produced by the host during infection. A whole-genome transposon sequencing analysis ( Tn-seq ) was performed to compare gene requirements for colonization in adult mice with and without treatment of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ). The results showed that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair ( MMR ) system, such as MutS, displayed a significant colonization advantage in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in NAC-treated mice. Further analysis revealed that the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC-treated mice was the leading cause of MutS mutant enrichment due to oxidative stress during infection. Additionally, the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in NAC-treated mice was significantly higher than that in NAC+ mice. These findings support a paradigm in which V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. The study also demonstrated that ΔmutS passage and complementation can be used to model hypermutation in diverse pathogens to identify novel stress resistance mechanisms. The results suggest that V. cholerae may utilize increased mutation rates as a temporal strategy for adopting advantageous phenotypes during infection of a ROS-rich host.
The study investigated the role of the Mlh1-Mlh3 endonuclease in meiotic recombination and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in baker’s yeast. Sixty new mlh3 alleles were analyzed, revealing five that specifically disrupted MMR and one that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The Mlh1-mlh3-32 allele, which disrupted meiotic crossing over, displayed wild-type endonuclease activity in vitro, while the Mlh1-mlh3-45 allele, which disrupted MMR, showed reduced endonuclease activity. The Msh2-Msh3 complex stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and mutant strains, revealing increased noncrossover events in all mlh3 mutants compared to wild-type. This suggests that recombination intermediates are resolved through alternative pathways in the absence of Mlh1-Mlh3. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh3, highlighting the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s enzymatic activity. The findings also demonstrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination pathways.
Biomedical research has shown that the structure of the host population plays a significant role in the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens after treatment discontinuation. When antibiotics are used intensively to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea, resistance levels in the pathogen population increase rapidly. As a result, older drugs are often discontinued and replaced with new ones. However, resistance levels often decline slowly or persist indefinitely, even after treatment is stopped. This phenomenon is attributed to the low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of the drug. A recent study reveals that host population structure, particularly heterogeneity in the number of contacts, also influences reversion dynamics. During treatment, host contact structure leads to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population. After treatment is stopped, host contact structure affects competition dynamics, mitigating the fitness advantages of the resistant strain. As a result, the rate of reversion and the probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level are lower. Simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in host structure is maximal when fitness costs of resistance are small, which is a biologically plausible parameter range for many pathogen-drug combinations. The study highlights the importance of considering host population structure in understanding the reversion dynamics of drug-resistant pathogens after treatment discontinuation.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable and characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although several highly penetrant ASD gene variants have been identified, there is growing evidence to support a causal role for combinatorial effects arising from the contributions of multiple loci. This study investigates the synergistic interactions between Drosophila orthologues of genes spanned by de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with autism. The researchers examined synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from dosage variants of unique human-fly orthologues in Drosophila and observed numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are jointly affected by large de novo CNVs. These CNVs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including a patient carrying a 22q11.2 deletion. The study demonstrates that dosage alterations of the unique Drosophila orthologues of candidate genes from de novo CNVs that harbor only a single candidate gene display neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants. Furthermore, the study shows that pairwise dosage changes within the set of orthologues of candidate genes affected by the same single human de novo CNV result in significant synergistic effects. The phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse supports a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change. The study illustrates mechanisms through which synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease.
Biomedical research has shown that CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) during Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in C57BL/6 mice. However, the mechanisms by which these cells mediate their pathogenic activity during malaria infection remain poorly understood. A recent study utilized intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometric analysis to investigate the behavior of brain-infiltrating T cells in mice infected with both ECM-inducing (P. berghei ANKA) and non-inducing (P. berghei NK65) infections. The results showed that T cells accumulated within the perivascular spaces of the brains of mice infected with both strains, but exhibited arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection. This behavior was characterized by the formation of long-term cognate interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen-presenting cells within the brains during P. berghei ANKA infection. The study also found that pathogenic CD8+ T cells colocalized with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, cellular apoptosis was a rare event and did not result in loss of cerebral vasculature or correspond with the extensive disruption to its integrity observed during ECM. The data suggest that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vihiga County, Kenya to determine the burden of Tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. A total of 437 participants, aged 5 years and above, were clinically examined for the presence of Tungiasis in 21 villages across three sub-locations. The overall prevalence of Tungiasis was found to be 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7-25.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the occurrence of Tungiasis was associated with low economic status, as indicated by a monthly income of Ksh ≤ 1000 (adjusted odds ratio 27.85; 95% CI: 4.13-187.59), lack of toilet facilities (4.27; 0.82-22.34), age of participant ≤14 (27.41; 10.02-74.99), no regular use of closed footwear (1.98; 0.987-3.97), and common resting place inside the house (1.93; 0.96-3.89). The study used Geographic Information System (GIS) to map the geographic distribution of Tungiasis in the area, showing that Chambiti and Selelwe villages had the highest concentration of cases. The findings suggest that Tungiasis is an important health problem in Vihiga County, primarily due to the low economic status of the affected population. The study highlights the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies to address the disease.
A computational model of auxin transport in Arabidopsis roots has been developed to investigate the dynamics of vascular patterning and lateral root initiation. The model considers the regulation of auxin efflux transporters by auxin and cytokinins in a spatial context, taking into account cell shape, polarity, and cell walls. Analysis of the model reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is theoretically unlikely and not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for the necessary feedbacks that amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. The model demonstrates the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness and predicts a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning. Simulations show that polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilizes auxin accumulation within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in xylem-pole pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. The model also reveals that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other. The study provides insights into the dynamics of transverse auxin transport and will contribute to the construction of three-dimensional models of auxin transport and root growth in Arabidopsis.
The neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in phase-related locomotor plasticity in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. A conserved transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein B (CREB-B), has been identified as a key mediator in this pathway. CREB-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region. The phosphorylation of CREB-B at serine 110 site dynamically changes in response to population density variation and is negatively controlled by NPF2. The involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity is further validated by RNAi experiment and behavioral assay. Protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. The study reveals a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity. CREB-B acts as a key mediator of the NPF/NO signaling pathway in regulating phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts. The essential role of CREB-B in locomotor plasticity is achieved through its direct control of NOS transcription under NPF2 regulation, and PKA transmits the effects of NPF2 on p-CREB-B. This study extends previous findings by uncovering two key signal components, CREB-B and PKA, in the NPF2/NO signaling pathway involved in the regulation of phase-related locomotor plasticity. The findings present a previously undefined regulatory mechanism on NOS transcription in insects and shed light on how neuromodulator/TF/effect gene network contributes to environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
The study investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), the researchers mapped regions bound by ZLD before, during, and after the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), a period of widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. The results showed that ZLD binds to thousands of regions in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. Early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage, but surprisingly, ZLD also binds to the promoters of genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is strong, suggesting that ZLD plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT. The study found that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. The results indicate that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a central role in regulating genome activity at the MZT. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ZLD activation and its role in early embryonic development.
Scientists have identified 109 novel protein–protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach. These interactions were found to be crucial for the regulation of circadian rhythms. One notable interaction was between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1, which resulted in the destabilization of BMAL1. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed using circadian expression data to predict the timing of PPIs. Systematic phenotyping using RNAi and overexpression suggested that components involved in dynamic interactions play a crucial role in circadian regulation. Analysis of a global dynamic network in the liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting regulatory interactions to specific phases. The study predicts that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. The findings provide a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics and highlight the importance of precisely timed PPIs for the circadian clockwork. Further research is needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the PPI network among circadian oscillator proteins and their dynamics, as well as the regulation of circadian output processes via time-of-day dependent PPIs.
The solution structure of a repeated unit of the ABA-1 Nematode Polyprotein Allergen (NPA) of Ascaris has been determined using protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein adopts a novel seven-helical fold, comprising a long central helix that participates in two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and the amino acid sidechains affected by ligand binding were identified. Recombinant ABA-1A contains tightly-bound ligand(s) of bacterial culture origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first mature, post-translationally processed, unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source, and it belongs to a new structural class. Nematode polyprotein allergens (NPAs) are a unique class of lipid-binding proteins found only in nematodes, and are synthesized as large, tandemly repetitive polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid-binding proteins. NPAs are central to the transport and distribution of small hydrophobic compounds between the tissues of nematodes, and may play key roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection. Immune responses to NPAs have been associated with naturally-acquired resistance to infection in humans, and the immune repertoire to them is under strict genetic control. NPAs have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of ciguatera fish poisoning in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people. This represents a 60% increase in the annual incidence of ciguatera compared to the 1973-1983 period, when the reported annual incidence was 104 cases per 100,000 people. Taking into account under-reporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera over the last 35 years. Ciguatera is a type of fish poisoning caused by the consumption of coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxin, which can lead to acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, as well as chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is often under-diagnosed and under-reported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. Ciguatera is a significant public health problem, particularly in vulnerable island communities, and its incidence is expected to increase due to environmental changes such as global warming, eutrophication, and coastal development. The study highlights the need for well-funded multidisciplinary research teams to translate research advances into practical management solutions to address this growing public health concern.
This study investigated the impact of benznidazole treatment on the functional response of Trypanosoma cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. Thirty-eight chronic Chagas disease patients and twelve healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T. cruzi antigens to analyze the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells before and after benznidazole treatment. The results showed that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in chronic Chagas disease patients compared to healthy donors. Additionally, a higher ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations was observed in chronic Chagas disease patients. Benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. The co-expression level of inhibitory receptors was reduced after treatment simultaneously with the enhancement of the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α was observed after treatment. These findings suggest that CD4+CD8+ T cells could be an important component of the immune response against T. cruzi infection during the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Benznidazole treatment improved the quality of antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cell responses and partially reversed the exhaustion process of these cells.
The study identifies Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) as a primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism and its role in seedling growth and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Lipidomic profiling of multiple plc mutants revealed that the plc2-1 mutant had increased levels of its substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphoinositide metabolic pathways. AtPLC2 displayed a distinct tissue expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. The seedlings of plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects that were complemented by heterologous expression of AtPLC2, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth. Moreover, the plc2-1 mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER stress as evidenced by changes in relevant phenotypes and gene expression profiles. The study highlights the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth, and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response. The findings suggest that AtPLC2 is a major phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C involved in phosphoinositide metabolism, seedling growth, and ER stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.
The article challenges the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level by introducing a principled measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, denoted as Φ. This measure is used to evaluate the cause-effect power of simple systems across different spatial and temporal scales by considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. The cause-effect power is evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. The results show that black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. This leads to the conclusion that a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which local maxima of Φ are identified during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, providing a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries. The results refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level.
The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of electron transport, which plays a crucial role in modulating cellular adaptation to environmental changes and can also cause cellular damage under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation. To investigate the mechanism and determinants of ROS production, a rule-based model of complex III was extended to account for electron transport, proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential generation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. The model was validated by fitting respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. The analysis revealed an association between ROS production and levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, was also found to be valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted and confirmed experimentally. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC. The model describes various states of respiratory complexes formed during electron transport, including those containing free radicals, which can be responsible for passing unpaired electrons to oxygen and forming superoxide radicals and other forms of ROS.
The article presents a semi-analytical approach to investigate the transport properties of molecular motor ensembles in eucaryotic cells. Motor proteins, which convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, work in teams to facilitate unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long distances. Disruptions in the transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor characteristics, are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. The study focuses on the effects of mutations on the transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. The results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces can determine the average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. Furthermore, mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is near the mutant’s stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. A semi-analytic method is developed to analyze the transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. This method can also be used to introduce alterations of single motor parameters to model mutations and deduce their effects on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors. The approach is easily implementable, and a software package is provided for general use.
The CACNA1C gene, which codes for the α subunit of Cav1. 2 L-type high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, has been associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. This study investigated the role of the Cacna1c gene in learning by selectively ablating it in mice and examining their behavior on an operant cue discrimination task. The task required mice to perform a nose poke response on one side of a touchscreen box in response to a light square in the upper central position of the screen and on the other side in response to the stimulus in the lower position. The results showed that Cacna1c knockout mice did not exhibit impaired learning in general, but rather adapted an outcome-based strategy to increase reward feedback across trials. In contrast, the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. This suggests that the Cacna1c gene plays a specific role in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The findings may also have implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with the CACNA1C gene. The study used a detailed, individual-level analysis of learning combined with Bayesian selection among computational models estimated from the empirical data to examine the effects of Cacna1c knockout on the learning process. The results indicate that the Cacna1c gene is involved in the selection of behavioral strategies rather than the strengthening of associative links.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being released worldwide to suppress arbovirus transmission. However, their ability to invade and persist in populations depends on interactions with environmental conditions, particularly temperature fluctuations. This study investigated the effects of cyclical heat stress on Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti. The researchers reared larvae infected with three types of Wolbachia ( wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA ) under diurnal cyclical temperatures of 26–37°C. The results showed that wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections exhibited reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbachia, and a sharp decrease in Wolbachia density in adults. Furthermore, these infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to 26–37°C across all life stages. In contrast, the wAlbB infection was maintained at a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under this temperature cycle. These findings have significant implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions across different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing. The study demonstrates that cyclical temperatures can impact the effectiveness of Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti, suggesting that temperature control is crucial for the success of Wolbachia-based arbovirus suppression programs.
The study aimed to investigate the natural history of adenovirus infections in non-human primates, including great apes and macaques. The researchers found that healthy populations of these animals shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in their stools, with shedding frequencies ranging from 22-38% among chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. In contrast, shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, comparable to previously reported frequencies. The study also identified 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques, which were fully sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ape adenoviruses could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, and that there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses. Furthermore, the study found that the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross-species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The findings suggest that adenoviruses are capable of establishing chronic infections following an initial exposure, which may or may not be clinically relevant. The study highlights the importance of considering the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut when designing and interpreting human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors. The results also warrant caution for primate handling and housing due to the high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates.
The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleus in the form of chromatin, with the fundamental structural unit being the nucleosome, a protein-DNA complex where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Using molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method, the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA were calculated. The results showed a free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping, which agrees with values obtained in single-molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating multiple potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping, with the dominant path likely being asymmetric. The unwrapping process was found to start at one end of the DNA, where the first five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped, followed by further unwrapping of 15 base pairs. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.
The study identifies a new mechanism by which the protein Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) protects cells from oxidative stress. ApoD is an extracellular lipid-binding protein with antioxidant properties that is secreted by astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the nervous system, to help neurons cope with oxidative stress. While the protective role of ApoD has been established, the cellular mechanism by which it exerts its effects was unknown. The study reveals that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic environment of the lysosome and helps to maintain lysosomal pH gradients by preventing lysosomal membrane permeabilization. This function is necessary and sufficient for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in both astrocytes and neurons. The study also shows that ApoD is required for two lysosomal-dependent biological processes: myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy in a Drosophila in vivo model. The results uncover a previously unknown biological function of ApoD and suggest that lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity is a new mechanism critical for the outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. The study provides a route of entry and a repair mechanism for lysosomes in pathological situations, opening up therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies from two geographically distant Ethiopian localities, Melka Werer (MW) and Addis Zemen (AZ), were studied for their biology, genetic analyses, and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani. The two colonies exhibited distinct life-cycle parameters, including different requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI mitochondrial genes revealed no genetic differences between the two colonies. F1 hybrids developed successfully with higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Experimental infections with L. donovani showed that even the lowest infective dose tested (2×10^3 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donovani infections in about 50% of the P. orientalis females. Using higher infective doses, the infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. Leishmania development in P. orientalis was fast, with metacyclic promastigotes present in the thoracic midgut and haptomonads colonizing the stomodeal valve by day five post-blood feeding. Both MW and AZ colonies of P. orientalis were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donovani strains, with an infective dose of one or two L. donovani promastigotes per sand fly blood-meal. The development of L. donovani was similar in both P. orientalis colonies, suggesting that the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in non-endemic area Melka Werer cannot be attributed to different susceptibility of local P. orientalis populations to L. donovani.
A patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was conducted for advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a Schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county of the People's Republic of China. The study aimed to quantify the quality of life and disability weight (DW) of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, which has not been included in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. A total of 215 cases were confirmed as advanced schistosomiasis japonica and evaluated using the European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (EQ-5D plus), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. The results showed that most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, including pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety or depression (80.9%). The overall DW was estimated to be 0.447, with age-specific DWs ranging from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. Multivariate regression models revealed that DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. The study provides updated data for a revision of the GBD and for evidence-based decision-making in the national schistosomiasis control program in the People's Republic of China.
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as nagana, are highly prevalent parasitic vector-borne diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. These diseases are transmitted to humans through the bite of a tsetse fly infected with the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) spp. A retrospective-cross-sectional study in Kenya used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in the country's 7 tsetse belts, where tsetse species are capable vectors for T.b.rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT. The study aimed to assess the potential of HAT-acquired infection in these areas. A multilevel study design estimated the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, nested within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. Tsetse fly's impact on disability was conceptualized via two exposure pathways: directly from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection or indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional deficiencies and poverty. The study identified tsetse belts that were significantly associated with increased disability prevalence and evaluated the direct and indirect exposure pathways. The results suggest that incorporating reports on disability from the national census is a promising surveillance tool that may enhance future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of HAT and AAT and the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas are likely contributors to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level.
The study investigated the mechanism of action of hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. HMBA was found to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the subsequent release of active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The released P-TEFb was then recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation and viral production. This process was dependent on the transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the phosphorylation of HEXIM1. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway or expression of a mutant HEXIM1 protein that could not be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonized HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. The study suggests that HMBA targets the pivotal cellular co-factor P-TEFb for the reactivation of HIV transcription. The findings reveal a regulatory mechanism that releases P-TEFb from HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA and provide insights into how modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation. Additionally, the study shows that HMBA can stimulate HIV transcription independently of NF-κB and that Tat can blunt the effects of P-TEFb reassembly by competing with HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA for binding to P-TEFb.
The presence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) in Leishmania parasites has been linked to the development of aggressive forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), including mucosal (ML) and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). LRV is associated with elevated parasitaemia, destructive hyper-inflammation, and an overall exacerbation of the disease. To improve detection and quantitation of LRV in Leishmania strains and species, researchers have developed various techniques, including the use of an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (J2). This antibody specifically and quantitatively recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a sequence-independent fashion, allowing for immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot applications. These methods complement existing detection tools, such as nucleic acid purification and quantitative real-time PCR. The J2 antibody was successfully used to detect LRV in several parasite strains, a freshly isolated patient sample, and lesion biopsies of infected mice. The study proposes that refinements of these methods could be transferred to the field for use as a diagnostic tool in detecting LRV and assessing the LRV-related risk of complications in cutaneous leishmaniasis. LRV has been detected in New World Leishmania species, including L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, and L. guyanensis, which are at risk for developing ML or DCL. The LRV dsRNA genome is recognized by host Toll-like-receptor (TLR3), exacerbating the disease in a dose-dependent manner. The study demonstrates the potential of the J2 antibody as a diagnostic tool for predicting LRV-related risk of leishmanial dissemination.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are closely-related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. To trigger pedestal formation, EPEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. The ability to generate these structures correlates with bacterial colonization in several animal models, but the precise function of pedestals in infection remains unclear. This study investigated the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells and found that both pathogens formed distinct bacterial communities, or "macrocolonies," that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Notably, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell. These data reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission. The study highlights the importance of EspFU in EHEC colonization and provides new insights into the mechanisms of EPEC and EHEC infection.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from helminth pathogens, such as Fasciola hepatica, have been isolated using differential centrifugation (DC) as the most widely accepted method. However, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been used to purify EVs from other pathogens, raising questions about the optimal purification method for helminth pathogens. This study compared DC and SEC methods for EV purification from F. hepatica culture media. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy revealed that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC-purified EVs. Protein quantification and Western blotting showed that SEC purification resulted in a higher EV purity to free excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield ratio compared to DC, with reduced soluble free cathepsin L proteases in SEC EV preparations. Proteomic analysis further demonstrated that DC-purified EVs contained more ESP and tegumental proteins than SEC-purified EVs. The results suggest that DC and SEC purification methods do not isolate equivalent EV population profiles, and caution should be taken when choosing an EV purification method. The study proposes that SEC methods should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies due to their higher EV purity to protein yield ratio and reduced contamination from ESP and tegumental components. The findings have implications for the development of reliable protocols for helminth pathogen EV analysis and application development, particularly in the context of host-pathogen communication and immunity.
The study employed a reverse-engineering approach to investigate the role of post-transcriptional regulation in pattern formation during the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers used detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression for the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant to develop and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation. The study aimed to determine whether post-transcriptional regulation is necessary for patterning in this system and to establish the structural and practical identifiability of the fitted model. The results showed that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrated that the uniqueness and specificity of the fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other complex biological processes. The approach involved fitting the model to protein expression data, using mRNA patterns as external inputs or boundary conditions, and analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters. The results were found to be robust and specific, yielding biologically plausible and informative values for rate parameters related to the time scale and diffusive properties of gap gene patterning. The study contributes to the understanding of the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in animal development.
This study investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse model. The results show that Toll-like receptor 3 ( Tlr3 ) expression is low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increases during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in Tlr3 or the adaptor molecule Trif ( TrifLps2/Lps2 ) exhibited significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in Tlr3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, a major contribution of the non-hematopoietic cell compartment in the Trif-mediated antiviral host response was detected in adult animals. Furthermore, a significant age-dependent increase of TLR3 expression was also detected in human small intestinal biopsies. The study suggests that upregulation of epithelial TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. Tlr3-Trif mediated innate immune signaling significantly influenced epithelial cytokine and chemokine expression, antiviral effector cell recruitment, and viral shedding in adult but not neonate mice. The results identify the postnatal increase in the intestinal epithelial expression of Tlr3 as a key factor determining the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection.
The study analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls of similar ancestry to identify rare, exonic variations associated with ASD. The data were generated by two centers using different methods for sequencing and variant calling. To ensure the distribution of rare variation was similar across centers, variants were filtered based on fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. Gene-based analyses of association were performed using both meta-analysis and mega-analysis, with the latter showing better power due to the nature of many gene-based tests. The study also explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and found that principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. Despite using a variety of gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, no new risk genes for ASD were identified in this sample. The results suggest that standard gene-based tests require much larger samples of cases and controls to be effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD. The study highlights the challenges of identifying rare variants associated with complex traits like ASD and the need for larger sample sizes to achieve genome-wide significance.
A retrospective study investigated the association between polymorphisms in the chitotriosidase and AMCase genes and the incidence of Madurella mycetomatis mycetoma in a Sudanese population. Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent causative agent of eumycetoma in Sudan, an infection characterized by the formation of grains. The study included 112 eumycetoma patients and 103 matched controls. Four polymorphisms in the chitotriosidase and AMCase genes were studied : a 24-bp insertion in the chitotriosidase gene ( rs3831317 ), resulting in impaired chitinase activity ; a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in the AMCase gene ( rs61756687 ), resulting in decreased AMCase activity ; a SNP ( rs41282492 ) and a 10-bp insertion in the 5’UTR region of the AMCase gene ( rs143789088 ), both resulting in increased AMCase activity. DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The study found that the polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased odds of eumycetoma ( odds ratio 2. 9; p = 0. 004 ). No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase. The results suggest that decreased chitotriosidase activity is associated with an increased risk of Madurella mycetomatis mycetoma.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) has long been studied as a prototype for viral latency, characterized by an acute or lytic phase followed by a latent phase. However, recent evidence suggests that the latent phase may not be as quiescent as previously thought, with lytic genes being transcribed during this state. To investigate this further, a highly sensitive Cre-marking model was used to study HSV-1 infection in mice. The results show that the distinction between lytic and latent phases is not as clear-cut as previously believed. Approximately half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred after the initial acute infection, and direct evidence was found that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency. This is consistent with either limited stochastic lytic gene expression being an integral part of latency or the early presentation of these proteins to CD8+ T cells providing an opportunity for reactivation to be halted at an early stage by an immune mechanism. The study also examined a virus where Cre was driven by the promoter for ICP47, a protein associated with immune recognition, and found that in some cases, the virus that spreads after the first week of infection initiates lytic gene expression. These findings provide direct evidence that lytic promoters can generate protein during latency and highlight the complex relationship between adaptive immunity and viral gene expression through all phases of HSV-1 infection.
Misfolding and aggregation of host proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases. In prion diseases, the host prion protein is misfolded to form a pathogenic protease-resistant form, PrPSc, which accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigated the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation in the CNS of mice infected with three different scrapie strains (22L, ME7, and RML) using dual-staining immunohistochemistry. The results showed that PrPSc from each strain had a distinct pattern of cell specificity, with strain 22L mainly associated with astroglia, strain ME7 mainly associated with neurons and neuropil, and strain RML showing a mixed pattern depending on the brain region.

The study also examined the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus of infected mice at preclinical times. Surprisingly, despite the differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains, and the small differences observed correlated with variations in the early disease tempo. Gene upregulation was associated with activation of both astroglia and microglia detected in early disease prior to vacuolar pathology or clinical signs. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed markedly from that seen in two acute viral CNS diseases, LaCrosse virus and BE polytropic Friend retrovirus, which had reactive gliosis at levels similar to the prion-infected mice.
The 3D organization of chromosomes plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell function. To understand the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding, researchers have developed polymer models and simulation methods to investigate the multi-spatio-temporal scales of chromosomes. However, chromosomes are long and densely packed, making it challenging to develop adequate models and simulation methods. To address this issue, the authors proposed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. The model accurately accounts for the polymer entanglement length and volumic density, capturing the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system. This approach offers a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and allows for the study of long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. The authors applied this strategy to investigate the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). The results show that a combination of the coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. The study demonstrates the utility of the coarse-graining approach to study chromatin organization in drosophila and highlights the importance of accounting for the time evolution of chromosome organization in quantitative models.
The article presents an integrative modeling approach to understand the mechanisms underlying cell type specificity of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). eQTLs are genetic variants that influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. The authors analyzed eQTL data from eleven studies on seven cell types and integrated it with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project. They found that eQTL SNPs overlap with hundreds of cell type-specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell-specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. Furthermore, they showed that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation. The study highlights the importance of integrating eQTL data with CRE data to understand the cell type specificity of eQTLs and to predict the function of GWAS SNPs with phenotypes relevant to cell types lacking eQTL data.
The development of a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits N-linked glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates has been achieved using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. This cell line, referred to as MGAT1− CHO, contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1), a key enzyme in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. As a result, monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1− CHO cell line exhibit improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) directed to the V1/V2 domain and the V3 stem, while preserving the structure of glycan-independent epitopes. The MGAT1− CHO cell line maintains a normal doubling time and ability to grow at high cell densities, making it a suitable substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. The development of this cell line addresses the challenge of producing vaccine immunogens that display early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, which are critical for binding to glycan-dependent bN-mAbs. This achievement has significant implications for the design and manufacture of HIV vaccines, particularly those targeting glycan-dependent epitopes.
The structure of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) from Brugia malayi, a parasitic nematode responsible for lymphatic filariasis, has been determined using X-ray crystallography. T6PP is essential for nematode survival due to the toxic effects of trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation. The protein structure consists of a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses identified five residues crucial for binding and catalysis. A proposed model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex suggests a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions. This is in contrast to the homolog sucrose-6-phosphate phosphatase, which relies on extensive hydrogen-bond interactions. The results indicate that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, utilizing substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket and non-native binding to the trehalose pocket. The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests a common strategy for inhibitor design, potentially leading to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics. A model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex was constructed using molecular dynamics simulations, providing a platform for inhibitor design.
A novel computational framework has been developed to simulate vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in whole, heterogeneous tumours. This framework incorporates realistic tumour vasculature and spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumour fluid dynamics. The model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed to investigate how tumour vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumour fluid transport. The framework was applied to an orthotopic murine glioma and a human colorectal carcinoma, and sensitivity analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the key biological mechanisms that determine tumour fluid transport. The results showed that incorporating realistic tumour vasculature is crucial for accurately predicting spatial flow heterogeneities induced by blood vessels. Furthermore, the study found that reducing tumour interstitial fluid pressure is not necessary to increase tumour interstitial perfusion, and that developing an interstitial fluid pressure gradient across the tumour is the key response. Vascular normalization was also found to alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity within tumours, suggesting that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumours.
HIV-1 can spread through both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes, but the relative importance of cell-cell transmission in natural infection and its vulnerability to inhibition by neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers used tailored experimental strategies to investigate the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission. The study found that the activity of these inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action. Specifically, gp41-directed agents remained active, while CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, lost potency during cell-cell transmission. This suggests that CD4bs mAbs preferentially block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. The findings provide a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in vivo. The study highlights the need to consider the efficacy of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies in blocking cell-cell transmission, which is a critical aspect of HIV infection in vivo. The results have implications for the design of neutralizing antibody-based HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, as it remains uncertain whether both cell-free and cell-cell spread of HIV must be blocked with equal efficacy or if only the dominant transmission mode needs to be targeted.
The article proposes a feedback model of attention that explains the diverse effects of attention on neural firing rates and receptive field structure in the visual system. The model suggests that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas like V1. The proposed mechanism requires the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range lateral inhibition between neighboring cells produces competitive effects that are automatically scaled to receptive field size in any given area. The model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters. It also makes the novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell. The model suggests that the observed effects of attention arise spontaneously from the interaction of feedback connections between higher and lower areas with short-range divisive mutual inhibition between neighboring cells within each area. The source of attentional modulation in the model is a plain response modulation of the top layer, which models the intermediate layers of the visual cortex.
The Drosophila posterior signalling centre (PSC) plays a crucial role in controlling hemocyte homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The PSC acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors, preserving their multipotent character necessary for differentiation into lamellocytes, a specific immune cell type required to fight wasp parasitism. A short type I cytokine-related receptor, CG14225/Latran, has been identified as essential for switching off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes, allowing for massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitization. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor, and antagonizes Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. In response to wasp parasitism, there is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the Latran/Domeless ratio. This sequence of events leads to the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling by Latran. The specific function of Drosophila Latran is the first in vivo example of a role for a non-signalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, raising the question of whether short, non-signalling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity. JAK/STAT activity has been associated with several human diseases, including leukaemia, and knock-out studies in mice point to a central role of this pathway in hematopoiesis and regulation of immune functions.
This study investigated the recombination patterns of two begomoviruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus (ToLCV), during a 120-day experimental infection of tomato plants. The results show that the recombination patterns between these viruses can be highly complex, with some recombinant genomes containing up to 58 detectable recombination breakpoints. The study found that local degrees of sequence similarity, but not genomic secondary structure, strongly influence the location of recombination breakpoints. Additionally, natural selection plays a significant role in shaping the overall patterns of recombination, favoring the preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The study also found that selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-genomic interactions, such as those required for proper protein and nucleic acid folding, is strong. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the imprint of selection favoring the preservation of co-evolved longer-range protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions can be used to identify the exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in begomoviruses and highlight the importance of selection in shaping the evolution of these viruses. The study's results also have implications for understanding the emergence of begomoviral crop pathogens, which have been attributed to natural inter-species recombination.
This study investigates the relationship between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution in eukaryotes and archaea. Nucleosomes, the basic repeat units of eukaryotic chromatin, have been suggested to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. Contrary to the popular idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukaryotes, histone proteins have also been discovered in some archaeal genomes. Despite fundamental differences between eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is strikingly conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The study examines whether selection or mutation can explain concordant substitution patterns in the two kingdoms and finds that neither the mutation nor the selection model are sufficient to explain the observed association. Instead, the study demonstrates that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a third model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. The study shows that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
The conformational diversity of a protein’s native state plays a crucial role in modulating its function. The selection paradigm suggests that different ligands shift the conformational equilibrium by binding to the protein’s highest-affinity conformers. A novel procedure has been developed to identify key positions that sustain conformational diversity associated with ligand binding. This method involves normal mode analysis of a coarse-grained protein model to explore conformational features. The procedure was applied to a refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in their bound and unbound forms. The results show a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on normal mode subspaces associated with ligand binding and position-specific evolutionary conservations obtained from multiple sequence-structure alignments. Positions whose mutations alter these subspaces the most are defined as key positions, which are dynamically important residues that mediate the ligand-binding conformational change. These positions are found to be evolutionary conserved and are mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein, such as β-sheets and α-helix. The findings suggest that these key positions are essential for the evolutionary conservation of protein conformational diversity required for ligand binding. The results provide new insights into the relationship between protein structure, dynamics, and function, and highlight the importance of conformational diversity in protein-ligand interactions.
The study investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by engineering an Mtb strain with regulated FBA levels. Depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, the essentiality of FBA could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, enabling the generation of an fba knockout (Δfba) strain. In vitro studies of Δfba revealed that lack of FBA could only be compensated for by a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, where growth and metabolism of butyrate were dependent on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings suggest that FBA is a potential drug target in both replicating and persistent Mtb. The study expands our understanding of the multiplicity of in vitro conditions that define the essentiality of Mtb's FBA in vivo. The results have implications for the development of new chemotherapies for tuberculosis, as Mtb mutants lacking metabolic enzymes are among the most attenuated in the mouse model of tuberculosis.
The study investigated the role of the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Leishmania lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, and mTXNPx is one of the enzymes responsible for peroxide removal in this organism. The researchers generated mTXNPx null mutants (mtxnpx−) and found that they were unable to thrive in a murine model of infection. However, the avirulent phenotype of mtxnpx− was not due to the lack of peroxidase activity of mTXNPx, as these mutants behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants added exogenously or generated by macrophages during phagocytosis ex vivo. Furthermore, mtxnpx− were also avirulent when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount an effective oxidative phagocyte response. To definitively conclude that the peroxidase activity of mTXNPx is not required for parasite survival in mice, a peroxidase-inactive version of this protein was used to rescue the non-infective phenotype of mtxnpx−. The results suggest that mTXNPx has a novel function as a molecular chaperone, which may explain the impaired infectivity of the null mutants. This premise is based on the observation that the enzyme is able to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro. The findings change the paradigm that regards all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins as peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate that these enzymes can be determinant for pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, specifically the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, for progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV-infected patients. A multicenter, prospective diagnostic test study was conducted in two secondary and eight tertiary-care facilities in Mexico, including 288 HIV patients with suspected PDH. The reference standard for diagnosis was Histoplasma capsulatum growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or compatible histopathologic examination. The results showed that 29.5% of patients had PDH, with a sensitivity of 67.1% and specificity of 97.5% for the HUAg test. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. In 10.5% of PDH-proven patients, a co-existing opportunistic infection was diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. The study found a high specificity but low sensitivity of the IMMY-HUAg test, suggesting that while it may be useful for starting early antifungal treatment, a culture-based approach is necessary due to frequent co-infections. The results are consistent with previous studies, which have reported varying sensitivities and specificities for different HUAg tests. The study highlights the importance of considering co-infections when diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients and the need for a culture-based approach to confirm diagnosis.
Title: Metagenomic Analysis of Human Diarrhea: Viral Detection and Discovery
    Summary: 
    Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, with approximately 1. 8 million deaths annually. However, in up to 40% of cases, no etiologic agent can be identified. Metagenomic sequencing offers a systematic and unbiased approach to characterizing microbial populations, including viruses, in stool during episodes of acute diarrhea. This study employed a “micro-mass sequencing” strategy to analyze eukaryotic viral communities in diarrhea specimens from 12 children. The approach involved minimal starting sample quantity ( <100 mg stool ), minimal sample purification, and limited sequencing ( 384 reads per sample ). The results revealed known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. This study demonstrates the potential of micro-mass sequencing to define the diversity of viral communities found in fecal samples from diarrhea patients. The findings provide a foundation for future studies to assess whether novel or unexpected viruses detected play a causal role in human diarrhea. This research expands on previous metagenomic studies of human stool, which have been limited to analysis of a few specimens from healthy patients. The results of this study will serve as a springboard for further investigations into the roles of diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.
Zika and dengue outbreaks in the Dominican Republic were compared using national surveillance data from 2015 to 2016. The study found that dengue cases were predominantly reported in individuals under 20 years old, with 75% of cases occurring in this age group. In contrast, Zika infections were more evenly distributed among the population. Dengue attack rates were higher in males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000 population), while Zika infections were more common in females (7.64 per 10,000 population) compared to males (2.72 per 10,000 population). The reproductive number (R0) calculations also showed a significantly higher metric among females for Zika (1.84) compared to males (1.72). Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) attack rates were slightly higher in males (0.62 per 10,000 population) compared to females (0.57 per 10,000 population). The study found little evidence that existing dengue immunity affected Zika attack rates at the population level. However, sex-specific over-reporting may have confounded R0 and incident risk calculations. The findings suggest that community awareness campaigns may have influenced increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Therefore, media campaigns and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 2 ( PARP2 ) is the predominant enzyme responsible for poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in response to DNA damage and immune responses. Unlike in animals, where poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP1 ) accounts for more than 90% of overall cellular PARP activity, PARP2 makes the greatest contribution to PARP activity and organismal viability in Arabidopsis in response to genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin C or gamma-radiation. Plant PARP2 proteins carry SAP DNA binding motifs rather than the zinc finger domains common in plant and animal PARP1 proteins. PARP2 also makes stronger contributions than PARP1 to plant immune responses, including restriction of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA double-strand break abundance. In contrast, poly ( ADP-ribose ) glycohydrolase 1 ( PARG1 ) is the major contributor to poly ( ADP-ribose ) removal from acceptor proteins in Arabidopsis. The activity or abundance of PARP2 is influenced by PARP1 and PARG1, which physically interact with each other and with PARG2. These findings suggest that core aspects of plant poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation are mediated by substantially different enzymes than in animals, indicating the likelihood of substantial differences in regulation. The results also indicate that PARP1 and PARP2 both contribute to poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation, but that PARP2 is the primary Arabidopsis enzyme responsible for poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation activity in response to DNA damage.
In C. elegans, the Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 ( PHR ) proteins regulate synapse formation and axon termination. The PHR protein RPM-1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. A new MAP kinase pathway has been identified that suppresses synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants, but not axon termination defects, in mechanosensory neurons. This pathway includes MIG-15 ( MAP4K ), NSY-1 ( MAP3K ), JKK-1 ( MAP2K ), and JNK-1 ( MAPK ). The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, suggesting a role in synapse development. Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway impairs synapse formation in wild-type animals. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit likely resulting from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These findings indicate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway restricts both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1, suggesting a complex regulation of synapse formation and learning in C. elegans.
The study investigated the evolutionary change within a bipotential switch that controls the sperm/oocyte decision in hermaphroditic nematodes. A bipotential switch is a transcription factor that can activate or repress the same target gene in response to changing signals from upstream genes. The study confirmed that the sex-determination protein TRA-1 is bipotential by identifying a co-factor, TRR-1, which is required for spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis briggsae. TRR-1 works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex to promote the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests revealed that TRR-1 works through TRA-1 to activate Cbr-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. The study also showed that TRR-1 regulates the development of the male tail and that Cbr-tra-2 and Cbr-trr-1 double mutants resemble Cbr-tra-1 null mutants, indicating that the two regulatory branches control all TRA-1 activity. Furthermore, the study found that the relationship between the two branches of the switch has shifted rapidly during evolution, with C. briggsae trr-1 null mutants preventing hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, while C. elegans fem null mutants prevent spermatogenesis. However, synthetic interactions confirmed that both halves of the switch exist in each species, suggesting that the same phenotype can be produced by alternative, complementary mechanisms.
The article introduces two new measures of integrated information, ΦE and ΦAR, which can be applied to time-series data to quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states. These measures overcome the limitations of ΦDM, a previous measure of integrated information that is defined only for discrete Markov systems, which are rare in biology. ΦE and ΦAR are designed to be easy to apply in practice and can be used to examine information integration in real and model systems. The authors use simulations to demonstrate the in-practice applicability of the new measures and explore their properties. The results provide new opportunities for examining the relationship between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, the findings also pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities, such as the integrated information theory of consciousness (IITC). The IITC posits that consciousness is equivalent to integrated information and has the status of a fundamental property of the universe. The new measures of integrated information, ΦE and ΦAR, can be used to test hypotheses and specify synthetic models aimed at examining the role of integrated information in neurocognitive processes. Future work will involve empirically examining integrated information in neuroimaging and other biological datasets, investigating how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations, and determining the theoretical implications of the new measures.
A Bayesian geostatistical analysis was conducted to investigate the spatial distribution of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in two recently affected districts of Uganda. The study aimed to provide a more robust evidence base for targeting control measures by accounting for spatial autocorrelation, incorporating uncertainty in input data and model parameters, and undertaking predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in the future. A generalized linear geostatistical model was used in a Bayesian framework to analyze the relationship between HAT prevalence and several social, environmental, and climatic variables. The results strongly supported the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. The analysis also confirmed the confounding effect of healthcare accessibility on the spatial distribution of HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicated an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of livestock trading for continued disease spread. The study demonstrated the utility of Bayesian geostatistical modeling for predicting HAT prevalence based on external covariates and provided strengthened evidence of the role of livestock trade in the continued spread of Rhodesian HAT within Uganda. The results emphasize the need for adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.
The feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems has been a long-standing assumption in the complexity-stability debate. However, this assumption has not been rigorously tested. The authors of this study provide analytical results and simulations that show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems. This challenges the conventional wisdom that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems. The authors extend their analysis to different interaction structures and intensities, finding that feasibility and stability are warranted in systems with weak interactions, regardless of species richness. This suggests that the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. The study highlights the importance of considering the feasibility of equilibria in ecological systems, particularly in species-rich communities where interactions should be moderate to ensure stability. The authors also demonstrate that network architecture plays a non-trivial role in determining equilibrium abundances, contradicting previous suggestions that topology has a minor role in system stability. Furthermore, the study shows that the probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially as the size of the network grows. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of ecosystem dynamics, one that takes into account the complex interplay between interaction strength, network architecture, and species richness.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to investigate the sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C. burnetii antibodies. The overall sero-prevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. However, no correlation was found between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or when accounting for spatial proximity between households. Multilevel regression analysis revealed that cattle obtained from markets and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had the highest sero-prevalence. In humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and variations were observed between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact, specifically grazing and dealing with abortion material, was also a risk factor for human exposure. The study suggests that environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, but human exposure patterns are likely driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The findings highlight the importance of livestock contact in the transmission of C. burnetii and indicate that livestock markets may be a suitable target for interventions. The study provides evidence of the endemicity of C. burnetii in Western Kenya, although the prevalence is relatively low.
The genome sequences of Schistosoma mansoni, a blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, have been analyzed to identify potential targets for novel anti-schistosomal interventions. Bioinformatics analysis revealed 33 putative DEAD-box RNA helicases in the S. mansoni genome, including three vasa-like genes, Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3, which are members of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the vasa-like nature of these genes. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 are expressed in various developmental stages of S. mansoni, including sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with high expression in the undeveloped egg. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis revealed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 are transcribed in the posterior ovary, where oocytes mature. The expression of these vasa-like genes in germ cell-rich tissues and organs of the adult female schistosome suggests that they may serve as informative landmarks for germ line transgenesis of schistosomes. This approach could aid in the development of novel anti-schistosomal interventions. The identification of vasa-like genes in S. mansoni highlights the potential of DEAD-box RNA helicases as targets for intervention in schistosomes. Germ cell-specific expression of these genes may provide a valuable tool for monitoring the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome germ line.
The Hippo signaling pathway plays a crucial role in organ development and tissue homeostasis, but its function in heart valve formation and maintenance was previously unknown. This study investigated the role of VGLL4, a transcriptional co-repressor in the Hippo pathway, in heart valve development and homeostasis. The results show that VGLL4 is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-EMT stage and is maintained until the adult stage. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that only loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells led to valve malformation with expanded expression of YAP targets. Furthermore, semi-knockout of YAP in VGLL4-ablated hearts significantly constrained hyperproliferation of arterial valve interstitial cells. These findings suggest that VGLL4 is essential for heart valve development and that manipulation of Hippo components may be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease. The study also found that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal arterial valve morphology and cardiac hypertrophy in aged mice, while semi-knockout of YAP rescued heart malformation induced by VGLL4 deletion. The results identify a previously unknown function of VGLL4 in valve remodeling and homeostasis, and suggest that mutations in VGLL4 may underlie human congenital heart valve dysplasia.
Recent studies have reported the presence of soft selective sweeps in humans, Drosophila, and HIV, suggesting that positive selection acts on standing genetic variation and multiple beneficial mutations. However, other researchers have questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. To reconcile these opposing results, three recent studies were evaluated using population genetic theory and extensive simulation. The analysis revealed that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genomic variation. The authors argue that the lack of sufficient model testing and statistical performance analyses underlying these claims of recurrent soft sweeps has led to inaccurate views of the evolutionary processes governing these organisms. The generalization of these results has resulted in misleading answers to decades-old questions in population genetics, with some suggesting a dominant role for positive selection in shaping patterns of genomic variation. The authors conclude that pervasive soft sweeps are a highly unlikely explanation for the observed patterns in humans, Drosophila, and HIV, given the highly non-equilibrium history of these organisms and the model specifics outlined by Jensen.
Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue fever, exhibit inhibited host-seeking behavior for three days following a blood meal due to a hemolymph-borne humoral factor. Head Peptide-I, a candidate peptide mediating this suppression, shows sequence similarity to short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs) that signal through Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Like Receptors (NPYLRs). The authors identified eight NPYLRs in the Ae. aegypti genome and screened them in a cell-based calcium imaging assay for sensitivity to a panel of peptides. Four NPYLRs responded to one or more peptide ligands, with NPYLR1 being the only receptor sensitive to Head Peptide-I and sNPFs. Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes. To investigate the role of NPYLR1 in host-seeking inhibition, the authors generated npylr1 null mutant strains using zinc-finger nucleases. However, npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior, suggesting that NPYLR1 alone is not required for host-seeking inhibition. The study deorphanized four Ae. aegypti NPYLRs and identified NPYLR1 as a candidate sNPF receptor sensitive to Head Peptide-I, but other receptors, additional peptides, or both may regulate this behavior. The findings propose two models for the regulation of host-seeking behavior in Ae. aegypti.
This study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ondo State, Nigeria, using satellite-derived environmental data and spatial analysis. The research employed multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Saaty’s analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the weight or importance of individual schistosomiasis risk factors, including temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover. These factors were reclassified and overlaid to identify areas vulnerable to schistosomiasis. The weighted overlay analysis was conducted after assigning weights to each factor based on the AHP. The prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in the study area was also determined through parasitological analysis of urine samples collected through random sampling. The results showed that 82% of the area falls under the high and very high risk category, with one community (Oba Ile) having the lowest risk and the risk increasing in the four remaining communities (Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese). The predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from the field study, with high risk zones corresponding to known endemic communities. The study demonstrated that environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schistosomiasis transmission and effective monitoring of disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities. The findings suggest that satellite-derived environmental data can be used to determine schistosomiasis risk levels in an area using relevant techniques.
Pneumococcal meningitis, a bacterial infection of the brain caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, results in significant morbidity and mortality. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin ( PLY ) is a key factor in determining the neuropathogenic potential of pneumococci. This study investigated the role of PLY in synaptic damage during pneumococcal meningitis. Post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis showed selective synaptic loss in the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex. A similar effect was observed in mice with pneumococcal meningitis only when the bacteria expressed PLY. Exposure of acute mouse brain slices to non-lytic concentrations of PLY caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduced this pathology. PLY increased glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices, and in mouse astrocytes, PLY initiated the release of glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner. The study proposes that PLY plays a significant role in pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. This is the first demonstration of synaptic pathology in pneumococcal meningitis and highlights the potential of PLY to dysregulate glutamate control in the brain, inducing excitotoxic damage. The findings suggest that PLY is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis and may contribute to the long-term cognitive decline observed in survivors of the disease.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers, and understanding their infectious life cycle is crucial for developing new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides. Research has shown that the HPV infectious life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus produced in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. However, it has been unclear why HPVs must first establish infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium. Using chemical biology approaches, scientists have revealed that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Specifically, they found that the recipient cell must enter the M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to take place. Inhibitors of the G1, S, G2, and early M phases of the cell cycle efficiently prevented infection, while late M phase inhibitors had no effect. These findings suggest that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. This discovery provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, where cells are progressing through the cell cycle. These results have important implications for HPV control, as they define a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection. Further research is needed to confirm the physiologic relevance of these findings in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models.
The study identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. The researchers used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNAs in both mycelial and yeast phases of the fungus. The results revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in the mycelial phase and 7 in the yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins, and the gene qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 was more closely related to homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp. Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in the mycelial phase. The biogenesis of both milRNAs was dependent on dcl-2, but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in a knockdown strain, supporting the regulatory function of milRNAs. These findings provide the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and the possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.
Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia in 2013 and spread throughout the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Two potential Aedes mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, may have contributed to the transmission of ZIKV. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013-2017 outbreak. Field-collected Ae. aegypti (three populations) and Ae. polynesiensis (two populations) from the Pacific region were orally exposed to a ZIKV strain isolated in the region in 2014. The results showed that ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between Ae. aegypti populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous between these populations. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. The study found that Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis from the Pacific region had a low ability to transmit ZIKV. The results suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, or a large immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013-2017 outbreak.
The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist is a master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. To study the structure of Xist in cells, the authors developed Targeted Structure-Seq, a new approach that combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. This method allows for high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads, providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. The authors used Targeted Structure-Seq to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist. The analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. The repeat A region of Xist is a functional element important for gene repression. The authors validated the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect that this approach will be particularly useful for advancing our mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs. The data generated by Targeted Structure-Seq can be used to develop a conformational model of full-length Xist, providing insight into RNA function, molecular evolution, and modularity.
A new statistical framework has been developed to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases. The framework connects various predictive indices and allows for the estimation of metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ), the mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, and the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of the population at the highest risk. The framework also enables the construction of graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, including the ROC curve, the density of risks, and the predictiveness curve. The results from simulations match well with theoretical estimates, and the methodology has been applied to nine complex diseases to evaluate the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants. The study highlights the importance of complementing AUC with other measures to assess the performance of genetic risk prediction models, as a high level of statistical significance does not necessarily equate to good predictive power. The framework provides a more comprehensive assessment of prediction model performance by incorporating additional indices and graphs, such as the net reclassification improvement ( NRI ), the integrated discrimination improvement ( IDI ), and risk distribution plots. This approach is particularly useful when established risk thresholds exist, as a large part of the ROC curve may be derived from cutoff points not of clinical interest.
A new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) was evaluated and compared to the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) and another RDT. The new RDT, SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, uses recombinant antigens and was tested on 57,632 individuals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The results showed that SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity at 71.2%, followed by CATT at 62.5% and SD BIOLINE HAT at 59.0%. CATT had the highest specificity at 99.2%, while SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had specificities of 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. The sensitivity of the tests was lower than previously reported due to the identification of cases from partially overlapping sub-populations. All three tests were more sensitive in passive screening than in active screening. Combining two or three tests increased sensitivity, with a combination of SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 reaching 98.4% in passive and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was more sensitive than SD BIOLINE HAT but less specific than CATT. The study suggests that using two or more tests can enhance the sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms, but may also decrease specificity.
In the municipality of Comapa, Department of Jutiapa, Guatemala, a region with persistent Triatoma dimidiata infestation, a decade of vector control activities has shown mixed results. Despite multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS), the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% in 2001-2002 to 27% in 2011. However, household construction materials alone predicted less than 10% of infested houses. Chagas disease seroprevalence in school-aged children declined by 10-fold, from 10% in 1999 to 1% in 2015. In contrast, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remains above 10%. After a decade of vector control activities, there is evidence of reduced transmission, but the continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. Systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation. The study highlights the need for sustained efforts to control Chagas disease in areas with persistent infestation, such as Comapa, where ecological, biological, and social risk factors contribute to the persistence of T. dimidiata infestation.
The bacterium Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and shares a common virulence strategy with the human pathogens enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The genome of C. rodentium strain ICC168 was previously sequenced and found to display characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen, including a large number of pseudogenes and IS elements. This study further investigates the genomic flux in C. rodentium, focusing on the impact of mobile genetic elements on its genome evolution. The results show that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable due to repeat-mediated, large-scale genome recombination and the active transposition of mobile genetic elements, such as prophages. An additional strain, EX-33, was sequenced to confirm that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species and that many inactivating mutations are common to both isolates and likely occurred early in the pathogen's evolution. The study draws parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens and suggests that C. rodentium may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The findings indicate that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that is still adapting to its new lifestyle, with many of its virulence functions located on horizontally acquired mobile genetic elements.
The article presents a computational framework for analyzing stochasticity in gene expression by inferring biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The authors propose a method to estimate these rate constants from protein expression distributions without making any limiting assumptions. They derive analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution and show that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions. An efficient algorithm is developed to infer gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. The method is applied to a particular steady-state protein distribution, and the results show that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets. However, the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanisms, allowing for the distinction between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs and regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. The framework is shown to be a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression. The method agrees with the current standard approach and identifies rate constants not previously obtainable in the restrictive regime where the standard method operates. In 91% of tested cases, the method obtains estimates of individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants, and in some cases, it identifies all underlying rate constants.
A novel vaccination strategy using bovine herpesvirus 4 ( BoHV-4 ) vectors expressing different monkeypox virus ( MPXV ) glycoproteins has been investigated for its efficacy in protecting against lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. Three recombinant BoHV-4 vectors, each expressing A29L, M1R, and B6R glycoproteins, were constructed and demonstrated to be safe and capable of expressing their transgenes following intraperitoneal administration. A small challenge study showed that BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with the other two vectors was able to protect 100% and 80% of STAT1(-/-) mice against mortality and morbidity, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of BoHV-4-based vectors as a vaccine platform for MPXV. The results are significant given the lack of FDA-approved therapies against MPXV and the limitations of current vaccines due to safety concerns. The use of BoHV-4 vectors may provide a safer and more effective alternative for protecting against MPXV, particularly in populations where smallpox vaccination is contraindicated. The study's findings have implications for the development of a vaccine against MPXV, which is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in Africa and has the potential to be used as a bioterror agent.
The ApaH-like phosphatase TbALPH1 has been identified as the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack homologues to the subunits of the decapping complex. Instead, TbALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation, consistent with a function in mRNA decapping. RNAi depletion of TbALPH1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in total mRNAs that are deadenylated but have not yet started 5’-3’ decay. In vitro experiments show that recombinant TbALPH1 protein sensitises the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only if an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase is included. This indicates that the decapping mechanism of TbALPH1 differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2 by leaving more than one phosphate group at the mRNA’s 5’ end. The substrates of eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatases are unknown, but the substrate of the related bacterial enzyme ApaH, diadenosine tetraphosphate, is highly reminiscent of a eukaryotic mRNA cap. TbALPH1 localises to P-bodies and its depletion causes the accumulation of deadenylated mRNA molecules that have not yet started degradation. Its exclusive co-localisation with the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA suggests that both enzymes are members of the same pathway. The data provide strong in vivo evidence for TbALPH1 being the trypanosome decapping enzyme. ApaH-like phosphatases are present in all branches of the eukaryotic kingdom, and this is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase.
The inactivation of the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells has been shown to trigger their neogenesis and conversion into functional β-like cells. Using conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, researchers demonstrated that the selective inhibition of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells at any age. This conversion induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, with the glucagon+ cells generated being subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. The study found that Pax4 is dispensable for these regeneration processes, indicating that Arx represents the main trigger of α-cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis. Importantly, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and thereby reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. The findings suggest that strategies aiming at inhibiting the expression of Arx, or its molecular targets/co-factors, may pave new avenues for the treatment of diabetes. The study provides evidence that the sole loss of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to initiate a continuous cycle of glucagon+ cell neo-formation and their conversion into β-like cells, leading to the regeneration of a functional β-like cell mass.
Eukaryotic cells employ a battery of regulatory mechanisms to prevent re-initiation of DNA replication at each of the thousands of origins in their genome. These mechanisms reduce the activity of replication initiation proteins to minimize the probability of re-initiation from multiple origins. However, recent studies have revealed that origins re-initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, suggesting an additional layer of replication control that can differentially regulate re-initiation at distinct origins. Novel genetic elements, termed re-initiation promoters (RIPs), have been identified that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of specific origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. The RIP elements map to ∼60 bp AT-rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. These elements do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and thus specifically act as re-initiation promoters. During the induction of re-replication, Mcm2-7 reassociates with both origins that preferentially re-initiate and origins that do not, suggesting that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after Mcm2-7 associates with origins. This local level of control creates a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential that is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-replication are compromised. These findings provide the first insight into how diversity can be introduced in the regulation of eukaryotic replication origins.
Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant public health concern, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1. A retrospective analysis of 170 HIV-1-infected patients with IA in Japan revealed that the clinical presentation of IA was similar to that in non-HIV-1-infected individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, while three died from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was effective in 165 cases, with no significant difference in recurrence rates between patients who received luminal treatment and those who did not. However, recurrence was more frequent in patients who were HCV-antibody positive or acquired syphilis during follow-up. Genotyping of E. histolytica was performed in 14 patients, but no correlation was found between genotype and clinical features. The study suggests that luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, likely due to re-infection. The findings support the use of metronidazole or tinidazole as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated amebiasis in HIV-1-infected individuals, and highlight the need for educational approaches to prevent new amebic infections in high-risk groups.
A study was conducted in the Mandoul focus of Chad to assess the impact of adding tsetse control to medical activities on the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and is transmitted by riverine species of tsetse flies. The study aimed to determine whether the addition of vector control to case detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and consequently decrease the annual incidence of HAT in the area. A census of the human population was conducted, and a pre-intervention survey of tsetse distribution and abundance was implemented. Tiny targets, which attract and kill tsetse, were deployed in the riverine habitats of tsetse in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The impact on tsetse and HAT incidence was assessed through nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015. Mathematical modeling was used to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening. The results showed that 70.4% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, and 62.8% of the reduction in new infections can be attributed to tsetse control. The study suggests that the combination of tsetse control and medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in 2014 and 2015. Model predictions anticipate that elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level.
A retrospective study of 1245 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain from 2009 to 2017 was conducted to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with the infection. The majority of cases (66.9%) were immigrants, with South America being the most frequent area of origin. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases, and detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients. Serological tests were used to diagnose the remaining cases. Treatment with ivermectin, compared to albendazole, was found to be the most strongly associated factor with achieving a cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study suggests that screening for Strongyloides stercoralis infection should be mandatory in patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, particularly those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation. The results of this study contradict those of a previous observational study in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which found that ivermectin treatment was not effective in all patients. The study highlights the need for a combination of diagnostic strategies, including classical parasitological methods, serology, and PCR, to accurately diagnose strongyloidiasis.
Vaccination is a crucial method for protecting against infectious diseases, and determining the optimal inoculum dose is a critical component of vaccine design. The inoculum dose refers to the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used in a vaccine formulation. While higher inoculum doses can stimulate a stronger immune response, they may also cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a mathematical modeling framework that combines experimental data to determine the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity. This framework was applied to data from influenza A virus ( IAV ) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus ( HPIV ) infection of cotton rats at various inoculum doses. The results showed that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen, and that protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. The framework can be used to predict the optimal inoculum dose for a given vaccine and setting, taking into account required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity. This approach can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum. The study demonstrates the potential of combining mathematical models with experimental data to inform vaccine design and improve public health outcomes.
The study investigated the spatial fluctuations in expression of the heterocyst differentiation regulatory gene hetR in Anabaena filaments under nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-deprived conditions. A chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion was used to measure hetR expression levels at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments. Statistical analysis revealed that hetR expression fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of approximately two to three cells. This coupling is primarily due to intercellular molecular transfer rather than cell division. The study found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments. A comparison of hetR-gfp expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions highlighted the differences between the HetR inhibitors PatS and HetN, as well as the differences in specificity between the septal proteins SepJ and FraC/FraD. The results demonstrate that proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell-cell communication combine to control the coupled fluctuations of gene expression that give rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in Anabaena. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying heterocyst differentiation and the development of multicellular patterns in cyanobacteria.
This study investigated the differential replication efficiencies of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) and genotype III (GIII) in avian cultured cells and young domestic ducklings. A serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs in China revealed a genotype shift from GIII to GI, with an average ratio of GI/GIII infection of 1.87. To understand the reasons behind this shift, the replication kinetics of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI strains and four GIII strains, were compared in mosquito C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC). The results showed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in DF-1 and PIEC cells, with titers reaching 22.9-225.3 fold higher than those of GIII strains. In vivo, young domestic ducklings inoculated with GI strains developed higher viremia titers and displayed a longer viremic duration than those inoculated with GIII strains. These findings suggest that GI viruses have an enhanced replication efficiency in birds, which may contribute to their increased transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle. The 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII viruses may be responsible for the enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in birds. These results provide insight into the reasons behind the JEV genotype shift from GIII to GI in China.
The Candida albicans biofilm transcription factor (TF) network is composed of six genes (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) that regulate biofilm formation. A systematic genetic interaction approach was used to analyze the network by generating all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and quantitatively analyzing the genetic interactions between them. The results showed that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with all six network heterozygous mutants exhibiting alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). Furthermore, many double heterozygous mutants showed phenotypes as severe as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent. The analysis revealed that the network has properties of a "small-world" network, which is highly efficient but not robust. The study also found that Tec1 is a network component whose expression is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the function of other network TFs, and that Rob1 expression is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network TFs. Additionally, the heterozygous Ndt80 deletion mutant was found to be hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a Tec1-dependent manner. Overall, the genetic interaction analysis of this network has provided new insights into the functions of individual TFs and the role of the overall network topology in its function. The study suggests that the structure and function of the biofilm TF network contributes to the ability of small perturbations to be communicated through the network to regulate the expression of a functionally important member of the network.
Leishmania infantum asparagine synthetase A (LiAS-A) is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine in an ATP-dependent manner, using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. Previous studies suggested that LiAS-A is essential for Leishmania donovani survival, making it a potential drug target. However, this study aimed to investigate the role of LiAS-A in Leishmania infantum. The results show that LiAS-A can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen donors, similar to Trypanosoma spp. and L. donovani. Targeted gene replacement was used to generate LiAS-A null mutants in L. infantum, which did not display significant growth or infectivity defects under normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. However, a severe impairment of in vitro growth was observed when null mutants were cultured in asparagine-limiting conditions. These findings indicate that LiAS-A is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal conditions. Therefore, LiAS-A is not considered a suitable drug target against L. infantum parasites. The study also highlights the differences in asparagine metabolism between Leishmania and Trypanosoma species, suggesting that asparagine homeostasis is differently regulated among trypanosomatids.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy. The review included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries worldwide, involving a total of 4740 subjects ( 2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 people without epilepsy ). The pooled odds ratio ( OR ) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity was 1. 69 ( 95% CI 1. 42–2. 01 ). A positive association was consistently reported in the restricted analysis, including studies that used Western Blot as a confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger populations, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome. The results provide epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy. New studies supported this association, particularly population-based studies. The findings suggest that health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp. are strongly advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis. The association between toxocariasis and epilepsy is still debated, but the updated meta-analysis provides a more accurate estimate of the relationship between the two conditions. Toxocariasis is a common helminthiasis infection worldwide and is potentially preventable, making it an important public health concern.
The article describes a novel ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA-335 (miR-335) that modulates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs activate ATM, which leads to the downregulation of miR-335, a microRNA that targets CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR). CREB, a transcription factor, is responsible for miR-335 expression and its binding to the promoter region is reduced after IR, consistent with previous studies showing that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CREB, reducing its transcription activity. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells results in reduced CtIP levels, post-IR colony survival, and BRCA1 foci formation. In patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, miR-335 expression is elevated, CtIP levels are reduced, and BRCA1 foci formation is decreased. Treatment with miRNA antisense oligonucleotides (AMO-miR-335) partially rescues colony survival, BRCA1 foci formation, and CtIP levels. These findings suggest that an ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions. The study proposes a working model in which the downregulation of miR-335 by ATM-CREB increases CtIP protein expression after IR-induced damage, enhancing the DNA damage response (DDR). The miR-335-CtIP axis impacts BRCA1 foci formation, cell cycle checkpoint regulation, DNA repair, and cell survival.
The study investigated the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, in learning during social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents that differed in their sophistication, and were led to believe they were either playing against another person or engaging in a casino-style game. Results showed that participants won against the sophisticated mentalizing agents in the social framing, but lost in the non-social framing. Furthermore, participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. These findings demonstrate the added value of mentalizing in learning during repeated social interactions and suggest that deciphering intentional behavior relies on a priori attributing mental states to others. The study supports the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which proposes that the brain assumes others are Bayesian learners and updates recursive beliefs based on repeated observation of others' behavior. The results indicate that social framing induces mentalizing and recursive inference, and that domain-general learning heuristics are vulnerable to artificial mentalizing agents in non-social contexts. The study provides the first demonstration of the importance of mentalizing in learning during social interactions.
Title: FastGGM: An Efficient Algorithm for the Inference of Gaussian Graphical Model in Biological Networks

A novel algorithm, FastGGM, has been developed for the statistical inference of Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) in biological networks. GGM is a probability model that characterizes the conditional dependence structure of a set of random variables by a graph, and has wide applications in the analysis of biological networks. However, existing approaches are either not statistically rigorous or are inefficient for high-dimensional data. FastGGM is an efficient algorithm that implements the estimation of GGM and obtains p-value and confidence interval for each edge in the graph, based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015). Simulation studies demonstrate that FastGGM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current implemented algorithm for Ren et al. without losing any accuracy.

FastGGM has been applied to two real data sets: transcriptomic data from a study of childhood asthma and proteomic data from a study of Alzheimer’s disease. The resulting networks reveal interesting interactions and the differential networks between cases and controls show functional relevance to the diseases. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package named “FastGGM” and is available for download. FastGGM provides an opportunity for researchers to study large-scale networks, such as gene/protein networks, using GGM in practice. It is an exact implementation of the asymptotically normal and efficient estimation established by Ren et al. (2015), and hence is statistically sound. FastGGM can make it feasible to infer biological networks under the framework of GGM at a whole-genome scale.
The striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network plays a crucial role in the learning and execution of movement sequences, with its population firing rates varying coherently on slow behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of a local MSN network has been shown to exhibit such activity, but only at realistic connectivities and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). This study investigates how MSN network-generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity, as would occur in a behavioral task. The results show that at unrealistically high connectivity, a stable winners-take-all type regime is found, where network activity separates into fixed stimulus-dependent regularly firing and quiescent components. In contrast, at lower connectivity, a more dynamically active regime occurs, where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. Only in the transition regime between these two do weak changes in cortical driving interact with many population components, resulting in reproducible activation of sequential cell assemblies for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. This activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes. The study suggests that the local MSN network has optimal characteristics, neither too stable nor too unstable, but rather optimized to generate stimulus-dependent activity patterns for long periods after variations in cortical excitation. The findings are supported by dynamical systems theory and have implications for understanding how the striatum processes sensory stimuli and behavioral task events.
The study investigated the relationship between polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast cells. Polarized exocytosis transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, while endocytosis retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. The study found that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p couples polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis, Sec4p binds Las17/Bee1p ( yeast Wiskott—Aldrich Syndrome protein [WASp] ) in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, whereas the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization established that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. The results support a model in which Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis to control surface expansion and refine cell polarization. The study also found that Sec4p physically interacts with Las17p and Sla1p, and induces Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in vitro. These findings suggest that Sec4p plays a specific role in actin patch assembly and endocytic internalization.
Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. The prevailing mechanistic explanation for this injury, known as the NAPQI zonation hypothesis, suggests that the formation of the reactive metabolite NAPQI within hepatocytes increases from the periportal space to the central vein (CV) of the liver lobule, leading to early perivenous necrosis. However, this hypothesis has not been directly challenged in mice due to the difficulty in controlling influential variables and obtaining sequential intracellular measurements at different lobular locations within the same mouse.

To address this limitation, virtual hepatocytes were used to simulate the behavior of liver cells in response to APAP exposure. These virtual cells were configured to exhibit location-dependent behaviors based on independently configured periportal-to-CV gradients. The results of these virtual experiments showed that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is insufficient to explain early perivenous necrosis. To develop a more comprehensive explanation, two additional features were incorporated into the model: a glutathione depletion threshold that decreases in the CV direction, and the ability to repair mitochondrial damage that also decreases in the CV direction. The inclusion of both features enabled the model to successfully replicate the observed phenomenon of early perivenous necrosis. This merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity in mice and offers a plausible explanation for the variation in necrosis scores among genetically diverse mouse strains.
This study aimed to improve the early diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in congenitally infected children. The diagnosis of infants born to T. cruzi-infected mothers currently relies on the detection of parasites by INP micromethod or the persistence of T. cruzi-specific antibody titers at 10-12 months of age. The study quantified parasitemia levels in 51 congenitally infected children using PCR and grouped them according to the results of one-year follow-up diagnosis. The results showed that neonates diagnosed by INP micromethod within the first month after delivery had a median parasitemia of 1,700 parasites/mL. Infants diagnosed at six months of age had a median parasitemia of 20-500 parasites/mL, while those diagnosed by serology at around 1 year old had a median parasitemia of 5-20 parasites/mL. T. cruzi parasites were isolated from 19 congenitally infected children, with 18 genotyped as DTU TcV (former lineage TcIId) and one as TcI. The study found that some children (22 out of 51) had parasitemia levels below the detection limit of the INP micromethod. The results suggest that more sensitive parasitological methods are needed to ensure early T. cruzi congenital diagnosis and prompt trypanocidal treatment. The study highlights the importance of developing more sensitive diagnostic methods to improve the early detection of T. cruzi infection in congenitally infected children.
A biophysical model of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been developed to predict growth rate and cellular composition from a coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment rich in resources. The model was applied to past measurements of growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio in seven E. coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from one to seven. The results showed that growth rate decreased for strains with fewer than six copies. The model was able to reproduce these measurements and suggested that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. Furthermore, the model predicted that increasing the copy number beyond seven would result in a densely packed cytoplasm with ribosomes and proteins, leading to weakened binding affinities and no substantial increase in growth rate. This prediction is consistent with other experiments. The model also suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. Additional observations regarding strains with altered rRNA operon copy numbers, such as nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response, are qualitatively consistent with the model.
The Arabidopsis MYB protein RSM1 interacts with the transcription factors HY5/HYH to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid ( ABA ) and salinity. RSM1 is a member of the MYB-related subfamily and has been implicated in plant development, stress responses, and hormone signaling. Down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of RSM1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Genetic analyses reveal that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses of seed germination, post-germination development to ABA and abiotic stresses, and seedling tolerance to salinity. Pull-down and BiFC assays show that RSM1 interacts with HY5/HYH in vitro and in vivo. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 ( ABI5 ), thereby regulating its expression, while RSM1 interaction also stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. The results suggest that HY5/HYH and RSM1 may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complicated proton pump of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Recent X-ray structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I revealed that redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule, far from the membrane domain. This implies that proton pumping within the membrane arm is driven indirectly via long-range conformational coupling. However, the molecular mechanism and the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites remain unclear. To address this, researchers deleted the gene for a small accessory subunit of Yarrowia complex I, resulting in a stable subcomplex ( nb8mΔ ) that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain. Analysis of the subunit composition of holo and subcomplex revealed that two subunits ( ND4 and ND5 ) with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters were missing in nb8mΔ. Notably, nb8mΔ still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. These findings suggest that the membrane arm of complex I harbors two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a long helical transmission element. This discovery provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of proton pumping in complex I and has implications for understanding the role of complex I in bioenergetic diseases.
This study investigated the effect of febrile temperatures on the binding affinity of antibodies to malarial and dengue antigens in vitro. The researchers used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ( ITC ) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) to measure the affinity of antibody-antigen complexes at 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. The results showed a significant increase in affinity at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C for both malarial and dengue antigens. Thermal equilibration of the protein partners prior to measurements further increased their binding affinity. The study suggests that febrile temperatures may play a positive role in modulating immune responses to infection by enhancing the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. The findings also highlight the importance of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity, particularly for samples with limited availability. Thermal equilibration of protein partners prior to in vitro assays may improve binding affinities and inform on the optimal temperature conditions for testing. The study provides new insights into the role of fever in regulating immune responses and has implications for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases caused by malarial and dengue viruses.
Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental process in cellular morphogenesis, generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors. To maintain continuous flow, local remodeling through crosslink unbinding and/or filament disassembly is necessary. However, how local remodeling tunes stress production and dissipation, and how this affects long-range flow, remains poorly understood. A computational model was developed to study a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress. The model included asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover. The analysis showed that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady-state flow in response to external stress. Steady-state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τm, then decreases with lifetime above τm. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τc, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady-state flow. When filament lifetimes are shorter than both τc and τm, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady-state stress on filament turnover cancel each other, resulting in flow speed being insensitive to filament turnover. This framework provides a basis for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, a quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis was performed to identify genetic loci that overcome the inhibition of seedling growth on high sugar media. A glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GSQ11, was mapped through selective genotyping and confirmed in near-isogenic lines in both Col and C24 backgrounds. Allelism tests and transgenic complementation showed that GSQ11 lies within the ANAC060 gene. The Col ANAC060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. A single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in Col ANAC060 affects the splicing patterns of ANAC060, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) that is present in the C24 ANAC060 protein. The absence of the TMD results in the nuclear localization of ANAC060. Glucose induces GSQ11/ANAC060 expression in a process that requires abscisic acid ( ABA ) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate transcription. The truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuates ABA induction and ABA signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity. This negative feedback from nuclear ANAC060 on ABA signaling renders seedlings insensitive to high sugar concentrations. The Col ANAC060 allele reduces ABA sensitivity and Glc-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI4 expression is also reduced in Col ANAC060 lines.
The Diguanylate Cyclase HsbD Intersects with the HptB Regulatory Cascade to Control Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm and Motility
    The molecular basis of second messenger signaling relies on proteins that synthesize, degrade, or bind cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) to produce coherent functional outputs. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, c-di-GMP regulates various behaviors, including the transition from planktonic cells to biofilm communities. However, the multiplicity of c-di-GMP control modules and regulated cellular functions raises the question of signaling specificity. This study demonstrates how c-di-GMP signaling gains output specificity in P. aeruginosa through the intersection of the c-di-GMP synthase gene hsbD with the HptB regulatory cascade. The HptB pathway controls biofilm formation and motility by involving both HsbD and the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. The rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade relies on the original interaction between HsbD and HsbA and the control of HsbD dynamic localization at the cell poles. HsbD and SadC, another c-di-GMP synthase, intersect within the same global regulatory network (Gac/Rsm) in a hierarchical order, contributing to the high c-di-GMP regime necessary for P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. The study suggests that HsbD and SadC act at distinct positions in the c-di-GMP network that controls P. aeruginosa behavior, with HsbD controlling biofilm formation and motility, and SadC regulating biofilm formation and swarming motility.
The study investigated the learning and generalization of visuomotor mappings based on contextual information. Participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while visual feedback was manipulated to require different visuomotor mappings depending on the target shape. The target shapes were morphed between spiky and circular shapes, and participants learned to associate each shape with a specific visuomotor mapping. After training, participants were tested on novel target shapes that had not been learned previously. The results showed that participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one, consistent with a Bayesian learning model. This model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the results. The study found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results, suggesting that this model may be a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings. The study also found that participants could extract the linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping and generalize accordingly, but this was not the primary mechanism of learning. The results indicate that learning the associations between shape cues and visuomotor mappings requires explicit awareness of the cues’ role, and that the Bayesian learning model provides a more accurate prediction of generalization.
The inferior olivary nucleus provides the cerebellum with one of its two main inputs, the climbing fibers, which are believed to be involved in timing of motor commands and motor learning. Climbing fiber activation leads to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, silencing them for a brief period. Research has shown that climbing fibers can transmit a short burst of spikes as a result of an olivary cell somatic spike, potentially increasing the information transferred to the cerebellum. A three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell was used to investigate the factors determining the size of the climbing fiber burst. The results suggest that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and that charge flow between the soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. Furthermore, the study found that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a significant effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. The model predicts that there may be a phase-dependency of climbing fiber burst size, but only in a limited range of sub-threshold oscillation (STO) amplitudes and in coupled cell ensembles of sufficient size. The study highlights the importance of understanding the electrophysiological properties of the inferior olivary nucleus to better comprehend the information it can and cannot transfer to the cerebellum.
A computational model of human liver iron metabolism has been developed to provide a quantitative understanding of the complex biochemical network involved in iron sensing and regulation. The model includes the core regulatory components of iron metabolism and was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and kinetic properties obtained from several publications. The model was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation recreated the dynamics and time scale of the system's response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was also created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation, providing a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. The model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve further knowledge of this system. The model is the most detailed quantitative mechanistic model of cellular iron metabolism to date, allowing for a comprehensive description of its regulation. It can be used to elucidate the link from genotype to phenotype, as demonstrated here with hereditary haemochromatosis. This computational modelling effort constitutes a clinical translational approach, enabling data from multiple sources to improve our understanding of human iron metabolism.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in regulating molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope by selectively controlling the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Despite its importance, the transport mechanism of the NPC remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure that mimics nucleocytoplasmic transport. This model takes into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats grafted on the elastic structure of the NPC and the hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and FG-repeats. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, the model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex through the NPC is approximately 2.6 ± 0.13 ms, with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The simulations also reveal that the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. Furthermore, the model shows that the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. Additionally, the study found that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport. The results also suggest that cytoplasmic filaments play a crucial role in the selectivity barrier of the NPC, as NPCs lacking these filaments exhibit high permeability to inert cargos.
Determining the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate (NHP) models is crucial for testing interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. A limiting dose of the infectious agent, where only a fraction of animals become infected, is often used in these models. However, finding the correct dose is challenging, as using too-high or too-low a dose can lead to false negative results and excessive animal use. To address this issue, a new protocol has been developed to determine the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time (AID50). This protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources required while providing an estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. The method involves iterative exposures of cohorts of animals to a dilution of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between each round to achieve 50% infection. The protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but is most critical for NHP models due to ethical considerations. On average, the protocol requires 15 animals, 3 phase 1 rounds, and results in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. By following this protocol, investigators can efficiently determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for NHP models, reducing animal use and resource waste.
The study reports a new form of adaptation in a first-order auditory interneuron (AN2) of crickets, characterized by a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curves toward higher stimulus intensities, resulting in reduced spike responses to low-intensity sounds. The researchers investigated whether this adaptation leads to an improvement in signal representation by comparing the experimental results with two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that information conveyed about the entire signal range should be maximized, while selective coding predicts that "foreground" signals should be enhanced while "background" signals should be selectively suppressed. The study used Bayesian data analysis to quantify the shifts of the measured response curves and found that adaptation actually reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals. The response curve changes were also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis, as the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal did not increase as predicted but remained nearly constant. Instead, less information was transmitted about signals with lower intensity. The study suggests that adaptation in the AN2 neuron does not follow the infomax principle, which predicts that adaptation should maximize the information conveyed about the entire signal range.
The study investigated the role of polybasic domains in the prion protein ( PrP ) in the context of prion propagation. Prions are infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Previous research suggested that polybasic domains of the cellular prion protein ( PrPC ) bind to the disease-associated conformer PrPSc, facilitating prion propagation. To examine this further, the study used prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed from Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( sPMCA ) reactions. The results showed that PrPSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain ( ΔC ) could bind to and induce conversion of all polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrPSc molecules. However, these ΔC-PrPSc prions displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrPSc, despite their ability to seed sPMCA reactions of normal mouse brain homogenate. This suggests that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism, and that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity. The study provides the first example of dissociation between normal brain homogenate sPMCA seeding ability and biological prion infectivity, and highlights the importance of polybasic domains in prion propagation.
A novel inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework was developed to identify animal behavioral strategies from behavioral time-series data. The framework was applied to C. elegans thermotactic behavior, where worms were cultivated at a constant temperature with or without food and then placed on a thermal gradient. The results showed that fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to control their behavior, involving two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM allowed worms to efficiently reach specific temperatures, explaining their thermotactic behavior when fed, while IM involved moving along a constant temperature, reflecting isothermal tracking. In contrast, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute temperature, but not its temporal derivative. The neural basis underlying these strategies was investigated by applying the IRL method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. The IRL-based approach was found to be useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. Cross-validation confirmed that the prediction ability for a future state transition was significantly higher in the 2-D than in the 1-D behavioral strategy, indicating that fed worms utilized sensory information of both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative for their behavioral strategy. The value function represented the benefit of each state, and by applying the IRL framework to time-series behavioral data, the value functions underlying thermotactic strategies were identified.
The draft genome sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin, a haptophyte belonging to the order Prymnesiales, has been reported. The nuclear genome of C. tobin is small (59 Mb), compact, and encodes approximately 16,777 genes, with 40% of the genome dedicated to protein-coding regions. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism exhibit distinct expression patterns over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The C. tobin genome harbors a unique hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. Additionally, a new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin and two "red" RuBisCO activases were identified, which are shared across multiple algal lineages. The C. tobin genome provides new insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. Haptophytes play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to carbon sequestration, serving as a food source for various organisms, and forming harmful blooms. The availability of the C. tobin genome sequence will enhance our understanding of haptophyte biology and facilitate the development of commercial applications, such as aquaculture feed stocks, nutraceuticals, plastics, and biofuel production. Furthermore, genomic knowledge of haptophytes will support efforts to understand the fundamental metabolic processes associated with harmful algal bloom events.
Breast cancers that are triple-negative for the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype. Research has shown that defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways are each associated with triple-negative and Basal-like subtypes. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and exhibit histologic features common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses reveal that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers. The results suggest that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas. Mouse models that mimic the complexity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be invaluable tools for defining the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for rigorously triaging new drug candidates.
Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector of dengue, the most important arboviral infection globally. Accurate predictions of vector populations are required to assess control methods and develop effective population reduction strategies. A study conducted in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, from 2004 to 2007, estimated model parameters using 84,840 samples of water-holding containers. Regression modeling was used to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. The results showed that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. A two-part modeling structure, called a hurdle model, was employed to account for the large number of zeroes and overdispersion present in pupal population counts. The study found that an ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is appropriate for predicting Ae. aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs. The findings suggest that incorporating development site density into vector control efforts, along with research on the ecology within larval development sites, will lead to a more cohesive understanding of Ae. aegypti population dynamics and contribute to the design of increasingly effective vector interventions.
The conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in coordinating larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in Caenorhabditis elegans. TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide genes, which reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status and provide a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of daf-7 and daf-28 in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits have been identified. The results suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state. Furthermore, intestinal TORC2 activity is required for food-dependent modulation of dauer entry and exploratory behavior in C. elegans, and the essential TORC2 component rict-1/Rictor acts in the intestine to promote neuronal expression of daf-7 and daf-28.
Systematic Identification of cis-Regulatory Sequences Active in Mouse and Human Embryonic Stem Cells
    A novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, was developed to identify short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression in pluripotent cells. The algorithm combines comparative genomics and DNA sequence segmentation to predict motifs in the upstream regions of coregulated genes. CompMoby was used to identify motifs that are statistically overrepresented in genes upregulated in mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and primordial germ cells, and highly conserved across multiple mammalian species. These motifs were shown to be preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner, and can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. Importantly, the activity of the motifs is conserved in human ES cells. The transcription factor NF-Y was identified as a regulator of gene expression in ES cells that is required for their proliferation. NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs and is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation. The study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species. The findings have implications for efforts aimed at directing differentiation of ES cells or reprogramming somatic cells.
The structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) N0-P complex has been characterized using a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of VSV N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P that binds RNA-free N (N0). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form and was solved at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy on the soluble complex confirm the binding of the MoRE and indicate that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure of this complex also suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. NMR spectroscopy confirms that the MoRE of P binds to N in the NΔ21-P60 complex in solution as in the crystal structure and shows that the regions of P flanking this MoRE remain flexible in the complex. The results suggest mechanisms for the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA and for the initiation of RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. The reconstituted NΔ21-P60 complex is a suitable model for the viral N0-P complex, and the crystal structure and NMR spectroscopy experiments show that the MoRE of P, which adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, includes residues 6 to 35 and corresponds closely to the fragment that was previously identified as essential and sufficient for maintaining N in a soluble form.
The study investigates the role of gap junctions (GJs) in the fly visual system, specifically in the vertical system (VS) network, which plays a key role in visual processing. Gap junctions are electrical synapses that allow direct communication between neurons. The VS network primarily connects via axonal gap junctions, making it an ideal system to explore the functional role of GJs in sensory information processing. An information-theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation (θ) of the fly’s ego motion within 10 ms following visual input onset. This encoding efficiency is near-optimal, matching the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input. The VS network is connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of VS cells, and the presence of axonal gap junctions enhances the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ, making it superior to the whole VS network. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly’s visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. The study suggests that gap junctions only impact the system’s readout while maintaining the dendritic input intact, indicating that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be richer than previously appreciated. The findings provide new insights into how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli and may encourage exploration of GJs as a common mechanism for improving information transmission in other neuronal systems.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children, and has been associated with various neurological diseases, including fatal cases in large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region. Recent studies have identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry and replication in leukocytes. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin expressed on the surface of leukocytes, which serves as a high-affinity counterreceptor for selectins and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. The interaction between PSGL-1 and P-selectin requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines and an adjacent O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction, a series of PSGL-1 mutants were generated and expressed in 293T cells. Flow cytometry assays revealed that O-glycosylation on T57, critical for PSGL-1-selectin interaction, is not necessary for PSGL-1 binding to EV71. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis at one or more potential tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 significantly impaired PSGL-1 binding to EV71. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 is critical for EV71 binding and replication.
The study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmaniasis, a serious global health problem. Mice infected with Leishmania major were treated with rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794, and their footpad swelling and parasite burden were assessed. The results showed that treatment with a clinically relevant dose of rapamycin or GSK-2126458, but not KU-0063794, significantly reduced footpad swelling and parasite load in the draining lymph node. The employed dose of rapamycin did not kill the promastigotes in vitro. Furthermore, the IL-4 production capacity of splenocytes from infected mice treated with rapamycin was significantly reduced, and the IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio was elevated, indicating a T helper-type 1 (Th1)-skewed cytokine profile. The expression level of CD69, an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also enhanced in rapamycin-treated mice. These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis due to their immunomodulatory properties. The study proposes that the adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors may also be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
The interdependence between the DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its cognate ComP receptor during natural transformation in Neisseria species has been functionally analyzed. Natural transformation is a biological process by which competent bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, some competent species preferentially take up their own DNA containing specific DUS watermarks. Recent findings identified ComP as the DUS receptor in Neisseria species, enabling a detailed analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence. Experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of ComP on transformation in the presence and absence of DUS, the importance of DUS and its bases for transformation and recognition by ComP, and the ability of naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals to transform Neisseria meningitidis. The results showed that ComP is essential for transformation in the presence and absence of DUS, and that inner bases of DUS are critical for recognition by ComP and transformation. Furthermore, naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals were found to be impaired for transformation of N. meningitidis, and a ComP homolog from a commensal species was shown to specifically bind its cognate DUS variant and mediate DUS-enhanced transformation in a comP mutant of N. meningitidis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveal a mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
In fission yeast, cytokinesis requires the coordinated closure of a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and the synthesis of a cell wall structure known as the division septum. A genetic study in fission yeast reveals that cooperation between the paxillin homolog Pxl1 and the glucan synthase Bgs1 is essential for CAR stability and septum formation. Pxl1 is required for ring integrity, while Bgs1 is responsible for linear β(1,3) glucan synthesis and primary septum formation. The study shows that Pxl1 and Bgs1 work together to anchor the CAR to the plasma membrane before septation onset and facilitate cleavage furrow formation. Depletion of Bgs1 in cells lacking Pxl1 results in failure of ring contraction and lateral cell wall overgrowth towards the cell lumen without septum formation. The study also finds that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis, which depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. The absence of Pxl1 is lethal when Cdc15 function is affected, generating a large sliding of the CAR with deposition of septum wall material along the cell cortex. The findings indicate that CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast. The study suggests that Pxl1 and Cdc15 cooperate with Bgs1 to confer stability to the CAR and form the septum during cytokinesis.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, occurred in Bahrain. To investigate the outbreak dynamics and epidemiology of the disease, researchers applied high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing to B. mallei isolates from infected horses and a camel. The results showed that the samples from the outbreak in Bahrain separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and evidence for the involvement of multiple B. mallei strains. The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than other B. mallei, indicating repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. High-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome analysis revealed the same phylogenetic patterns among the samples. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. The recent emergence of glanders in combination with worldwide horse trading poses a new risk for human infections. The study suggests that at least two different B. mallei populations were involved in the outbreak, with strains from 2010 and 2011 found in both clusters, indicating an outbreak that persisted across both years and was caused by two independent but temporally simultaneous introductions.
A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to investigate the clinical and parasitological features of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) who did not respond to treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). The study recruited 43 patients from three Colombian Army National reference centers for complicated ACL. The majority of patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, and 35% of the isolated parasites showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility after previous administration of the medication. The study found a negative correlation between lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite, as well as a negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance to Glucantime. Leishmania braziliensis was the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The study suggests that the indication of a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives in cases of therapeutic failure of ACL produced by L. braziliensis is debatable. The study's findings highlight the need for further research on the mechanisms of resistance to Glucantime and the development of new treatment strategies for ACL. The study's results also emphasize the importance of species confirmation in the diagnosis and treatment of ACL, as L. braziliensis is more prone to treatment failure than other Leishmania species.
In Escherichia coli, the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores ( enterobactin, salmochelins, and yersiniabactin ) and the genotoxin colibactin require a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase ( PPTase ). Two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been identified, with EntD being part of the core genome and ClbA encoded on the pks pathogenicity island. The pks island is associated with the high pathogenicity island ( HPI ) in highly virulent E. coli strains. This study investigated the interplay between siderophore and colibactin biosynthetic pathways through potential functional interchangeability between EntD and ClbA. The results show that ClbA can contribute to siderophore synthesis and that inactivation of both EntD and ClbA abolishes the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli ( ExPEC ) in a mouse sepsis model. The presence of either functional EntD or ClbA is required for ExPEC survival in vivo. This study demonstrates a connection between multiple phosphopantetheinyl-requiring pathways leading to the biosynthesis of functionally distinct secondary metabolites in E. coli. The data suggest that the association of the pks island with HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores. The findings highlight the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features with different functions and identify key points of these networks as potential targets for anti-virulence therapy strategies.
The article presents a probabilistic model of multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model. The model is based on a continuous Markov process and assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. The authors extend the program dnaml in phylip to incorporate this model, resulting in a new program called dnamlε. The extended program is shown to improve accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. The authors assess the performance of dnamlε using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments. The results demonstrate that dnamlε outperforms the usual approach in terms of accuracy. The article also discusses the limitations of current phylogenetic models, which only account for residue substitution events, and highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used for other sequence analysis problems, such as HMMs and SCFGs. The Felsenstein peeling algorithm, which is the basis of maximum likelihood methods in many phylogenetic inference tools, is also discussed as a key component of the new model.
This study investigated the mechanism by which immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is initiated in human skin. HSV initially infects the mucosal epidermis before entering nerve endings. In mice, epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but it is CD103+ dermal DCs that carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for antigen presentation. This study compared HSV-1 infected human foreskin explants with biopsies of initial human genital herpes lesions to show that LCs are initially infected and then emigrate into the dermis. LCs bearing markers of maturation and apoptosis formed large cell clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments were observed inside the dermal DCs/macrophages, and the BDCA3+ dermal DCs had up-regulated a damaged cell uptake receptor CLEC9A. Correspondingly, LCs isolated from human skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro also underwent apoptosis and were taken up by similarly isolated BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells. These findings suggest that a viral antigen relay takes place where HSV-infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken up by dermal DCs for subsequent antigen presentation. This provides a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal HSV immunization. The study demonstrates that LCs take up HSV, become infected, and pass live virus or antigen onto dermal DCs through cell clusters in the dermis. BDCA3+ or DC-SIGN+ dermal DCs taking up HSV antigen via LCs may be able to present HSV antigen to T cells in the lymph nodes and the dermis itself after CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration.
This study investigated the biogenesis and remodeling of Leishmania parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with either Leishmania major or L. amazonensis amastigotes. Using multidimensional imaging of live cells and the lysosomotropic fluorescent probe Lysotracker, the researchers characterized three dynamic features of Leishmania amastigote-hosting PVs. These features include the entry of Lysotracker transients within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major amastigote-housing PVs, the decrease in the number of macrophage acidic vesicles during L. major PV fission or L. amazonensis PV enlargement, and the L. amazonensis PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. The study also examined the biogenesis of large or tight-fitting, membrane-bound Leishmania PVs in live infected macrophages and found that the fission of Leishmania tight-fitting PVs is a two-step process involving the replication of amastigotes in a single PV prior to separation into two distinct PVs. The process is accompanied by the depletion of macrophage small acidic compartments. Additionally, the study found that approximately 50 acidic vesicles in macrophages infected with L. major or L. amazonensis are consumed in the course of intracellular infection, representing a hypothetical volume contribution of 30 µm3 to Leishmania PVs.
The study investigated the role of chromatin structure in regulating homology-directed repair, specifically gene conversion, in the chicken B cell line DT40. Immunoglobulin genes in DT40 undergo regulated sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The researchers found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. To directly demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, they used a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 was tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vλ donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, resulting in nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations. These results suggest that chromatin structure regulates homologous-directed repair. The study also found that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. The findings have practical ramifications for developing strategies that harness a cell's capacity for homology-dependent repair to promote gene therapy. The results suggest that permissive structure at the donor will be an important design parameter in developing donor genes for therapeutic applications. The study provides new insights into the role of chromatin structure in regulating gene conversion and homologous recombination in vertebrate cells.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior to meet the demands of a given situation. It is generally believed that cerebellum-based motor learning is guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, or error information. This error information is thought to induce lasting changes in parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells, which in turn mediate behavioral adjustments. Olivary climbing fibers, which connect with Purkinje cells, are assumed to convey information on instant errors necessary for synaptic modification, but not to contribute to error memory. However, recent studies have challenged this concept, including a previous study on short-term saccadic adaptation that observed patterns of complex spikes ( CS ) at odds with the assumptions of the mossy axon interneuron ( MAI ) theory. To further investigate the role of climbing fibers in cerebellum-based motor learning, the authors employed a random error saccadic adaptation paradigm, which avoids the gradual buildup of strong behavioral changes and the accompanying diminution of the error. The results show that complex spikes exhibit a clear signature of the error at the time of its occurrence and a reverberation of this signature much later, before a new manifestation of the behavior, suitable to improve it. These findings suggest that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in cerebellum-based motor learning than previously thought, and that they may contribute to error memory.
In a study using a yeast model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), researchers found that overexpression of the Sis1 chaperone reduced the effects of TDP-43 on toxicity and proteolysis. TDP-43 is a protein frequently associated with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, and its aggregation is thought to contribute to disease pathology. The study showed that overexpressed TDP-43 altered cell shape and reduced ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct in yeast. However, overexpression of Sis1, a heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) chaperone, mitigated these effects. The study also found that Sis1 did not physically associate with TDP-43, suggesting an indirect mechanism of action. Furthermore, overexpression of the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, reduced TDP-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons. These findings suggest that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS and related conditions characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of DNA/RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43. The study highlights the potential of Sis1 and its homologues as therapeutic targets for the treatment of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.
The study aimed to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. A total of 65 patients were recruited, with 35 (53.8%) presenting positive amplification by real-time qPCR. The parasite load was quantified, with a median of 2.54 parasite equivalents/mL, ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 parasite equivalents/mL. Notably, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old, with a median of 20.05 parasite equivalents/mL. Using guanidine-EDTA blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains, it was possible to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 parasite equivalents/mL with high specificity. The T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) were identified in 28 patients (80%), with TcVI, TcII, and mixed infection TcVI+TcII being the most prevalent. Two patients were infected by TcV, and one patient was coinfected by TcIII+TcVI. The parasite load was higher in patients infected by TcII compared to those infected by TcVI. However, patients infected by TcII had a lower frequency of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) compared to those infected by TcVI or TcV. The study contributes to the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlights the importance of patient age and infection by TcII in determining higher parasitemia levels.
Between 2009 and 2011, enhanced bat rabies surveillance was conducted in Guatemala as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies virus (RABV). The overall prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low, at 0.3%. However, viral antigens were detected and infectious virus was isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RABV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, and viral RNA was detected in all tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR, except for the liver of one bat. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that the two viruses were 100% identical, while sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution. The two vampire bat RABV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. This study provides the first report and isolation of RABV from bats in Guatemala, highlighting the need for novel strategies to prevent and control bat-associated zoonoses in tropical regions.
The study investigated the role of A-type lamins in herpesviral DNA targeting and heterochromatin modulation during lytic infection. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA initiates replication in replication compartments near the inner edge of the nucleus, where histones are excluded. The study used wild-type and A-type lamin-deficient (Lmna−/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to examine the role of nuclear lamins in HSV replication. In Lmna−/− cells, viral replication compartments were reduced in size and failed to target to the nuclear periphery, as observed in wild-type cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed that HSV DNA was associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna−/− MEFs. These results suggest that A-type lamins play a functional role in viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. The study found that lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina serves as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications. The study provides evidence that lamin-dependent targeting of the HSV genome to the nuclear periphery is associated with a reduction of heterochromatin on viral lytic genes. Further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism by which the nuclear lamins are exploited by HSV to keep its genome transcriptionally active during productive infection.
Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organelles was linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex is common to all forms of mitochondria, but an unexpected diversity of subunits between eukaryotic lineages has been predicted. This study analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialized anaerobic form of mitochondria found in Trichomonas vaginalis. The results show that the highly divergent β-barrel T. vaginalis TOM (TvTom) 40-2 forms a translocation channel to conduct hydrogenosomal protein import. TvTom40-2 is present in high molecular weight complexes, which contain four tail-anchored (TA) proteins. Two of these proteins, Tom36 and Tom46, have heat shock protein (Hsp) 20 and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains and can bind hydrogenosomal preproteins, likely functioning as receptors. A third subunit, Tom22-like protein, has a short cis domain and a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment but lacks a trans domain. The fourth protein, hydrogenosomal outer membrane protein 19 (Homp19), has no known homology. Electron microscopy revealed that TvTOM forms three pores and has an unconventional skull-like shape. The study suggests that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
A comparative eQTL analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was conducted to investigate the pathogenic implications of autoimmune mechanisms. The study revealed cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases, including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13. 2 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene. A common missense variant in IL27 was identified as a significant trans-eQTL for IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. This variant is associated with type 1 diabetes and results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. The study suggests that the rs181206[G] variant of the IL27 gene confers protection against type 1 diabetes through the inhibited expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, IL-27 may promote autoimmunity toward pancreatic islets via the upregulation of the STAT1 pathway. The results indicate that eQTL mapping in purified T cells provides novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases. The study highlights the importance of cell type-specific regulation of gene expression in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with various immune-related diseases, and this study contributes to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
A qualitative study was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to investigate community perspectives on the treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The study involved semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national HAT control program in the Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental provinces. The results showed that community members and healthcare providers adhere to strict prohibitions after HAT treatment, including avoiding work, sexual intercourse, hot food, and walking in the sun for six months. These prohibitions are believed to prevent serious complications, but are not evidence-based and were originally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the melarsoprol regimen, which is no longer used due to its high failure and adverse event rates. The prohibitions have become taboos that deter people from participating in HAT screening campaigns, fearing they will have to observe these restrictions if diagnosed. The study highlights the need for better understanding and addressing these socio-cultural and economic barriers to enhance the effectiveness of HAT control efforts in the DRC. The findings suggest that providing correct health information and engaging in a dialogue with the community is essential to keep abreast of unintended transformations of meaning and to improve HAT control strategies coordinated by the Programme National de lute contre la Trypanosomiase Humaine Africaine (PNLTHA).
Between 2009 and 2011, Médecins Sans Frontières diagnosed and treated patients with visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) in Tabarak Allah Hospital, eastern Gedaref State, Sudan. To estimate the VL incidence in surrounding villages, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was conducted in 45 villages of Al-Gureisha locality between May and June 2011. A total of 17, 702 households were interviewed, representing a population of 94, 369 inhabitants. The crude mortality rate over the mean recall period of 409 days was 0. 13/10'000 people per day, with VL being a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths. The VL-specific mortality rate was estimated at 0. 9/1000 per year. The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7. 0/1000 persons per year, or 7. 9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. The survey found that 12. 5% ( 11, 943/95, 609 ) of the population reported a past VL treatment episode. Visceral leishmaniasis represents a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State. Active VL case detection had a low yield in this setting with adequate access to care, suggesting that it may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts.
The study investigated the relationship between gyrase supercoiling and transcription elongation in bacterial chromosomes. Gyrase catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA, which helps condense bacterial chromosomes into a compact structure. The supercoil density (σ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible supercoil density (σD) and constrained supercoil density (σC). The study found that Escherichia coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica. Using a 9 kb "supercoil sensor" inserted at ten positions around the genome, the study monitored supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in wild-type and mutant strains of Salmonella. The results showed that RNA transcription causes (−) supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) relaxed excess upstream supercoiling, while gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Mutations in the gyrase gene (gyrB) caused significant supercoil losses, which were influenced by transcription. Addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. The study found a link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover, suggesting that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow-growing species. The results indicate that the mean supercoil density of Salmonella DNA is determined by a mechanism that links the catalytic efficiency of gyrase to the elongation rate of transcription.
Leishmania amazonensis, a protozoan parasite responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World, replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles ( PVs ) that share characteristics with late endosomes/lysosomes. Research has shown that L. amazonensis PVs expand significantly during infections, but the impact of PV size on parasite intracellular survival was unknown. This study investigated the role of LYST/Beige, a gene previously linked to lysosome size regulation, in controlling PV expansion and parasite growth. The results indicate that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYST/Beige transcription, which restricts PV expansion and inhibits parasite growth. Mutations in LYST/Beige caused further PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication, while overexpression of LYST/Beige led to small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment with vacuolin-1 reversed the phenotype of LYST/Beige overexpressing cells, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. In contrast, E-64d reduced PV size in LYST-Beige mutant cells and inhibited L. amazonensis replication. The study suggests that enlarged PVs protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs. The findings provide evidence that LYST/Beige upregulation functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival.
Zebrafish with a mutation in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which is associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), a rare X-linked psychomotor retardation disorder, were generated using a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated targeted gene editing system. The MCT8 knockout zebrafish (mct8−/−) exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. These deficiencies were associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live mct8−/− larvae revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. The administration of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs, which can enter cells in the absence of MCT8, restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae. These findings suggest that MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly, mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. The mct8−/− zebrafish model provides a stable and transparent vertebrate model for studying AHDS, allowing for whole-brain analysis in live animals during all developmental stages. The study proposes that early administration of TH analogs may specifically reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH/gL forms a stable complex with the viral fusion protein gB in virions. This complex is present in the absence of other viral proteins and can include up to 16-50% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles. The interaction between gH/gL and gB is not dependent on the fusion competence of gB, as gB mutants that are unable to mediate cell-cell fusion can still interact with gH/gL. These findings have significant implications for models of herpesvirus entry, which suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion. Previous studies have proposed that gH/gL is activated by receptor binding and then binds to gB, triggering gB for fusion. However, this study provides direct evidence for the interaction between gH/gL and gB in wild-type glycoproteins in virus-infected cells and in virus particles. The presence of gB-gH/gL complexes in extracellular virions suggests that these complexes form before gB is activated for fusion and entry. These findings support the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB and have implications for our understanding of the entry mechanisms of HCMV and other herpesviruses.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variants segregate in a mutation and tissue-specific manner, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. A study has identified Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, as a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. The researchers used a heteroplasmic mouse model to demonstrate that Gimap3 influences the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. The study found that Gimap3 is essential for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases. The researchers also showed that mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues is a complex genetic trait that is regulated with age but is independent of mtDNA copy number. Further analysis revealed that Gimap3 regulates mtDNA segregation through a cell-specific context or pathway, rather than through a direct physical interaction with mtDNA. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA segregation and highlights the importance of Gimap3 in regulating this process in hematopoietic tissues. The findings have implications for understanding the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and their role in human mitochondrial diseases.
The incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a geographically-restricted infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been estimated in Victoria, Australia. A retrospective review of 443 cases of BU notified between 2013 and 2016 identified 20 new cases among short-term visitors to endemic regions. The mean incubation period for these cases was 143 days (4.8 months), which is similar to a previous estimate of 135 days (4.5 months) from an earlier study. The incubation period was defined as the time between exposure to an endemic region and symptom onset. The study found no association between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic region, or location of BU lesion. The results confirm the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria to be between 4 and 5 months. This knowledge can guide clinicians and suggests that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria. The study's findings are consistent with a previous estimate from an earlier group of patients who acquired their infections in a different geographic location, suggesting that the mode of disease transmission is similar in different Victorian endemic regions.
The study investigated the role of a Toxoplasma gondii protein, named TgNCR1, which is related to the human Niemann-Pick, type C1 (NPC1) protein. TgNCR1 contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) and shares significant identity with human NPC1, including residues implicated in human NPC disease. The protein localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Toxoplasma, rather than endo-lysosomes like its human counterpart. When expressed in mammalian NPC1 mutant cells and targeted to endo-lysosomes, TgNCR1 restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from these organelles, indicating a conserved activity with human NPC1. To understand the role of TgNCR1 in Toxoplasma, the researchers generated a parasite cell line lacking NPC1, which was viable but exhibited perturbations in lipid content, including an overaccumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. The mutant parasites also showed increased storage lipid bodies and membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles. Notably, ΔNCR1 parasites were more virulent in mice than the parental strain and could generate multiple daughters per single mother cell at high frequencies, allowing for fast replication in vitro. These findings suggest that TgNCR1 plays a role in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma, controlling the intracellular levels of several lipids and regulating lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg Anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, with post-axial oligosyndactyly. Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis identified mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight unrelated families, including four nonsense, two frameshift, and two missense mutations. The missense mutations are located in the second Thyroglobulin Type-1 (Tg1) domain of the protein. The orthologous gene in mice, Smoc1, shows site- and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc1 resulted in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations, including coloboma and cleft palate, in homozygous mutant animals. These findings suggest that partial loss of Smoc-1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the human disease. The SMOC-1 protein is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic, and functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice. These findings support the loss of SMOC-1 function as the major cause of OAS and highlight the conserved non-redundant function of this protein during ocular and limb development.
The study investigated the role of the tripartite motif protein TRIM22 in inhibiting HIV particle production in human cells treated with Type 1 interferons. The researchers used transcriptional profiling to identify TRIM22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes in response to interferon treatment. Over-expression of TRIM22 was previously shown to inhibit HIV replication, but this study aimed to determine whether TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector when expressed at physiological levels. To address this question, the researchers used RNA interference to deplete TRIM22 in cells treated with interferon and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the absence of TRIM22. This suggests that TRIM22 plays a key role in inhibiting HIV replication in response to interferon treatment. Further studies showed that TRIM22 specifically targets the HIV Gag protein, blocking its release from the cell. The researchers also found that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain of TRIM22 are required for its antiviral activity. These findings indicate that TRIM22 is a key mediator of the interferon response in inhibiting HIV replication. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Type 1 interferons restrict HIV replication and identifies TRIM22 as a potential target for antiviral therapy.
The fig-pollinator mutualism between fig trees (Ficus) and their host-specific wasp pollinators (Agaonidae) is a classic example of an obligate mutualism, where both species benefit from the interaction. However, the stability of this mutualism is problematic to explain, as cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Research has shown that in monoecious Ficus species, pollinator galls are segregated in inner ovules, while seeds are found in outer ovules, suggesting that wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipositing into outer ovules. A study on Ficus rubiginosa found that offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium, resulting in a gradient of offspring viability towards the centre of the syconium. This gradient is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, reducing their galling rates and potentially contributing to mutualism persistence. The study suggests that parasitic wasps may play a previously unidentified role in stabilizing the fig-pollinator mutualism by forcing pollinators to focus on a subset of ovules, thereby reducing their galling rates. This mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence independently of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators. The study highlights the potential for parasitic wasps to contribute to the maintenance of the fig-pollinator mutualism.
The study investigated the genetic and environmental factors influencing plant height in the model C4 grass Setaria. Six controlled growth trials were conducted on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to assess the effects of developmental queues, water availability, and planting density on plant height. The results showed that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting, and is affected by growth environment. The study found that plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait, with major genetic loci influencing height functioning independently of growth environment. The identity and contribution of these loci change dynamically throughout development, and the reduction of growth observed in water-limited environments is a consequence of delayed progression through the genetic program establishing plant height in Setaria. The study also identified 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with plant height throughout development within the Setaria RIL population. Analysis of ortholog positions suggests that known height-affecting genes from the Poaceae account for only a fraction of the identified loci. The results support a chronological genetic model of plant height, which may explain the differences in plant height observed when parental lines are grown in controlled environments versus field settings. This model highlights the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors in determining plant height, a critical component of plant architecture.
A recent study in the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal, West-Central Brazil, has confirmed the circulation of Ilheus virus (ILHV), a zoonotic arbovirus, in the region. The study, which involved the collection and testing of 3,234 adult mosquitoes from 16 species between 2009 and 2010, found that one pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis mosquitoes tested positive for ILHV by culture and real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full-length genomic sequence of the isolated virus exhibited 95% identity to the only available full genome sequence for ILHV. This finding confirms previous serological evidence of ILHV infection in horses from the same region, which suggested that at least three flaviviruses, including ILHV, circulated in the Pantanal between 2005 and 2009. The study highlights the potential medical importance of ILHV in the region and warrants further investigation by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians. The anthropophilic behavior, high prevalence, and susceptibility to infection of Aedes scapularis, the mosquito species from which ILHV was isolated, implicate it as a potential vector for the virus. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of ILHV in the Pantanal and emphasize the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of arbovirus activity in the region.
A preclinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose moxidectin (MOX) compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once), IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice), or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by evaluating mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions. At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX efficacy was 100% and remained unchanged until study-end (D47), compared to 62% (range 26-100%) for IVM. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, thereby covering the mite's entire life cycle and enabling long-lasting efficacy. The results demonstrate that oral single-dose MOX was more effective than two consecutive IVM-doses, supporting MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies. The study suggests that MOX may be a promising alternative to current treatments for scabies, which are often insufficient and have emerging drug resistance. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans.
Scientists have investigated the peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and prevalence in hospitals. The PG synthesis machine is responsible for synthesizing the main component of the bacterial cell wall and is the target of many antibiotics. To identify the essential components of this machine, researchers deleted seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome, resulting in a strain capable of PG biosynthesis catalyzed only by two penicillin-binding proteins, PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. This minimal PG synthesis machinery allowed the bacteria to grow and divide normally in vitro. However, in clinically relevant environments, the bacteria became highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics and host lytic enzymes, and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. The results suggest that most of the PG synthesis enzymes are redundant in vitro, but play an important role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus in vivo. The study identifies the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus and highlights the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments other than in vitro growth. The findings have implications for the development of antibiotics capable of inhibiting the final stages of PG synthesis.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a saprophytic bacterium that can infect humans, resulting in a difficult-to-manage disease with mortality rates ranging from 20% to over 40%. Despite its virulence, little is known about how B. pseudomallei infects, invades, and survives within its hosts, including the role of iron in its pathogenesis. It was previously assumed that B. pseudomallei used iron-acquisition systems commonly found in other bacteria, such as siderophores. However, a previous study found that a clinical isolate carrying a deletion of the malleobactin gene cluster, which encodes the bacterium's major high-affinity siderophore, was still fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. This suggests that other iron-acquisition systems may contribute to virulence. In this study, the major siderophore malleobactin (mba) and pyochelin (pch) gene clusters were deleted in strain 1710b, revealing a residual siderophore activity unrelated to known Burkholderia siderophores. Deletion of the hemin uptake loci, hmu and hem, showed that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, while Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.
Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs) provide comprehensive representations of cellular metabolism, but their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies between concurrent models. To address this issue, a new tool called COMMGEN (COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration) has been developed. COMMGEN automatically identifies inconsistencies between multiple GSMs of the same organism and reconciles them to generate a consensus model. This consensus model is more consolidated, comprehensive, and accurate than individual GSMs due to shared, unique, and reconciled parts. COMMGEN uses novel algorithms to resolve common problems that arise during GSM integration, such as identifying similar or identical reactions in different cellular compartments. The tool forms a necessary bridge between full automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus metabolic model generation. Tests of COMMGEN for four organisms showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and increased the coherence of knowledge representation. These models were found to have higher predictive power than manually curated GSMs and were comparable to manually constructed consensus models. COMMGEN is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as for eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions. The tool is expected to contribute to the consolidation of knowledge of metabolic function and improve the usability and reliability of GSMs for elucidating cell function interactions.
Biomedical research has revealed that cartilage matrix plays a crucial role in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification, a process by which cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. Chondrocytes embedded in a proteoglycan-rich matrix undergo a developmental transition, or maturation, which triggers the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) to induce bone formation in the overlying perichondrium. A mutagenesis screen in zebrafish identified mutations in two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1), which encode enzymes involved in proteoglycan synthesis. These mutations resulted in decreased cartilage matrix and premature perichondral bone formation. Positional cloning and biochemical analyses confirmed that the mutants lacked wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which are abundant in cartilage matrix. Ultrastructural analyses revealed aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mutants. The data suggest that CSPG defects in fam20b and xylt1 mutants accelerated chondrocyte maturation and Ihh expression, leading to early perichondral bone formation. Rescue experiments and gene expression studies supported this conclusion, demonstrating that PG mutant chondrocytes underwent precocious maturation, inducing early perichondral bone. These findings indicate that cartilage matrix plays a critical role in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation, and that mutations in fam20b and xylt1 disrupt this process, leading to premature bone formation.
The study investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top2) in the proper separation of heterochromatic regions during Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis. Heterochromatic homology is essential for the segregation of achiasmate chromosomes during meiosis I. The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Top2 in the later stages of meiosis and observed specific defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions after spindle assembly. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I, resulting in long, abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips of the projections. Despite these anomalies, bipolar spindles were observed in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, although the obligately achiasmate 4th chromosomes exhibited a near-complete failure to move toward the spindle poles during prometaphase I. Both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation. The study suggests that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved for meiosis to be completed. The results indicate that Top2 plays a crucial role in releasing the bonds that hold heterochromatic regions together during prophase, allowing for proper chromosome segregation.
The mass use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars was evaluated as a public health measure to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. An interventional study was conducted in two areas: an intervention area where VL seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for almost two years, and those that remained seronegative in the intervention area received new collars and newly identified seronegative dogs were included and collared. The local zoonosis control authorities were notified of any dogs that tested seropositive in both areas, which were subsequently marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. At the second evaluation, significant reductions in seroprevalence were seen in both areas, while seroprevalence in the intervention area reduced to 6.0% during the final evaluation versus an increase of 11.0% in the control area. This significant increase and the estimated relative risk (RR = 0.55) indicated protection against CVL in the intervention area. Although CVL incidence did not differ significantly between the areas, an increased tendency was observed in the control area. The study suggests that deltamethrin-impregnated collars may provide protection against CVL over time, but the effectiveness of this measure as a community-wide public health control measure remains inconclusive.
Biologists have long been puzzled by the nonrandom gene content on the mammalian X chromosome. While sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline have been proposed as explanations, a new study suggests that the haploid expression of the X chromosome may be a more significant factor. The study used data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome ( FANTOM5 ) project to examine the maximal expression levels of genes on the X chromosome compared to autosomes. The results show that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is significantly lower than that of genes on autosomes, with an average of three times lower maximal expression on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Additionally, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. The study also found that X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression compared to autosomal genes if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. These findings support the "traffic jam" model, which proposes that the haploid expression of the X chromosome limits the maximal expression of X-linked genes due to transcriptional traffic jams. This model also explains the lower breadth of expression for genes on the X chromosome and the rarity of highly expressed tissue-specific genes on the X. Overall, the study provides a new perspective on the evolution of gene content on the mammalian X chromosome and highlights the importance of considering the constraints imposed by haploid expression.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of Western Pygmies from Cameroon. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka individuals and 101 non-Baka individuals from neighboring agriculturalist populations. Unexpectedly, the study found a significantly lower H. pylori infection rate in Baka Pygmies (20.8%) compared to non-Baka individuals (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pylori isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, and most isolates were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations. An age-structured transmission model suggested that the low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies could be achieved within a few hundred years, likely due to demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference indicated that Baka Pygmies almost certainly acquired their extant H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors. The study's findings suggest that Baka Pygmies were either H. pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations. The results have implications for our understanding of the evolutionary history of H. pylori and its relationship with human populations.
The C-terminal 18 amino acid region (Cter18) of the dengue virus NS5 protein plays a crucial role in regulating its subcellular localization and contains a conserved arginine residue essential for infectious virus production. NS5 is the most conserved non-structural protein among flaviviruses and is responsible for capping, methylation, and replication of the viral RNA genome. The Cter18 region is sufficient to direct the protein to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the dengue virus serotype. A low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 Cter18 and the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha (Impα) was observed, allowing for the purification, crystallization, and visualization of their molecular complex at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed residues important for NS5 subcellular localization, including a conserved arginine residue (R888) that forms a hydrogen bond with tyrosine 838. Mutating R888 to alanine resulted in a completely non-viable virus, while mutating it to lysine led to a severely attenuated phenotype. The Cter18 region is thought to be involved in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcellular localization. The findings suggest that the Cter18 region is a key determinant of NS5 subcellular localization and may play a role in modulating innate immune responses and other host factor interactions that contribute to dengue pathogenesis.
A novel integrated mapping protocol, known as the Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) Methodology, has been developed and field-tested for lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). This protocol aims to determine whether a threshold has been reached to trigger public health interventions in an implementation unit. The ITM methodology is designed to be resource-efficient and relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators in disease-specific age groups. The protocol was tested by comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each of the targeted diseases in one district each in Mali and Senegal. The results showed that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool has the potential to facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries. The ITM methodology does not provide prevalence figures, but rather aims to determine whether a disease has reached the threshold for public health intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and field practicality. The results suggest that the ITM methodology can be used as an operational tool by Ministries of Health in NTD-endemic countries to determine if the threshold needed to launch disease-specific public health interventions has been reached.
The conserved phosphatase Cdc14 plays a crucial role in the exit from mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cdc14 is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the Cfi1/Net1 protein until early anaphase, at which point it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two redundant pathways, the FEAR (Cdc fourteen early release) network and the MEN (mitotic exit network), promote Cdc14 release. However, a novel requirement for the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase has been identified in the cell cycle-dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79) but is not dependent on the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Sir2. Additionally, defects in Cdc14 release have been observed in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation (meH3K36) and in cells lacking an HDAC recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors required for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components. The nonredundant role for these modifications in this context contrasts with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes. The study provides evidence for a role for the conserved ubiquitin ligase Bre1 and monoubiquitination of histone H2B in the early phase of mitotic exit.
Title: Automated Discovery of Functional Generality of Human Gene Expression Programs

    A novel computational framework, GeneProgram, has been developed to identify expression programs, sets of co-expressed genes orchestrating normal or pathological processes, from human expression data compendia. GeneProgram addresses challenges associated with cellular inhomogeneity, genetic and environmental variation, uncertainty in the number of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. This unsupervised framework uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to simultaneously organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior.

    GeneProgram produces maps of expression programs, sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. The framework was applied to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets, exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, many of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors.

    The discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection is expected to guide future biological experiments. Genes from programs with low generality scores may serve as new drug targets with minimal "cross-talk," while genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states. GeneProgram is a multipurpose method that can be applied to novel compendia of biological data.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) locus in NKG2Chi natural killer (NK) cells. In individuals seropositive for HCMV, NKG2Chi NK cells undergo epigenetic remodeling of the conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) region of the IFNG locus, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. This epigenetic imprinting enhances IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells. The accessibility of the CNS1 region is crucial for this process, as it acts as an enhancer of IFN-γ transcriptional activity. This epigenetic imprinting is a hallmark of NKG2Chi NK cells expanded in HCMV+ individuals and cytokine-primed NK cells, which display memory-like properties. The study suggests that epigenetic regulation of the IFNG locus contributes to the high IFN-γ competence and stability in NK cells with memory-like properties. Furthermore, a broader epigenetic remodeling accompanies these adaptive features, indicating that both inflammatory and pathogen cues induce epigenetic remodeling of NK cells. These findings provide a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells and suggest that common epigenomic features may be functional hallmarks of memory-like NK cells and memory T cells.
The bacterium Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteasome system to temporally regulate the activity of its effector protein SidH through the metaeffector LubX. LubX functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets SidH for degradation in the host cytoplasm. This results in the shutdown of SidH at later stages of infection. The temporal regulation of SidH by LubX and the host proteasome system represents a novel mechanism by which bacterial effectors are regulated. This is the first example of a bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host cells, and the authors propose the designation "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors. The determinants of susceptibility to degradation are encoded in the effectors themselves, and LubX controls SidH instability in the host cytosol by directly targeting it for host ubiquitination. The targets of bacterial E3 ligases remain largely unknown, and this study identifies SidH as the first example of a bacterial target of a bacterial E3 ligase effector. The findings suggest that some bacterial effectors implicated in manipulation of the host ubiquitin system may possess regulatory functions as metaeffectors that coordinate the expression of effector functions spatiotemporally.
This study investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env coding sequences in 81 very early B subtype infections to understand the host environment and immune responses experienced by the newly transmitted virus. The researchers found evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identified a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than expected under a model of neutral evolution. Of 24 such rapidly diversifying sites, 14 were embedded in CTL epitopes that were verified experimentally or predicted based on the individual's HLA or in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. This suggests that APOBEC may facilitate early immune escape. Ten rapidly diversifying sites could not be explained by CTL escape or APOBEC hypermutation, including the most frequently mutated site in the fusion peptide of gp41. The study also examined the distribution, extent, and sequence context of insertions and deletions and found that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection and not of mutational hotspots. The results provide a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission, highlighting the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections. The study used a large dataset of 2, 207 env coding sequences from early stages of HIV-1 infection to assess whether there are consistent patterns of evolution that tend to recur across multiple patients in early infection.
The Role of Multiple Marks in Epigenetic Silencing and the Emergence of a Stable Bivalent Chromatin State
    A minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast has been introduced and analyzed to identify the essential epigenetic marks for the bistability of epigenetic states. The model incorporates two key chromatin marks, H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores the effects of multiple marks on the system's behavior. The results show that the presence of both modifications is crucial for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. In addition to the silenced and transcriptionally active states, the model predicts a novel bivalent state with both active and silencing marks under certain perturbations, such as knock-out mutations or inhibition/enhancement of enzymatic activity. This bivalent state is shown to result in patchy silencing. The model also reveals a titration effect due to a limited supply of silencing proteins, leading to counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of the silencing system are systematically investigated, and experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, providing insights into which marks are essential for resolving epigenetic fate and which reinforce one fate over another. The study highlights the importance of multiple marks in epigenetic silencing and the emergence of stable bivalent chromatin states.
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) among children remains a significant health issue in developing countries, manifesting in two forms: oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition. While the pathogenesis of SAM is not fully understood, research suggests that gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis is associated with oedematous malnutrition. This study aimed to investigate whether GM composition differs between Ugandan children hospitalized with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. Fecal samples were collected from 87 children aged 6-24 months, and GM composition was analyzed using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-oedematous children having lower GM alpha diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal significant differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The study found that non-oedematous SAM children had lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified. These findings suggest that GM dysbiosis may play a role in the development of SAM, but further research is needed to establish a causal relationship. The study's results also highlight the need for further investigation into the therapeutic potential of pre- and probiotics in treating SAM among children in developing countries.
The study investigated telomere length variation in 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive telomere length variation in Saccharomyces paradoxus isolates. Telomere length correlated with geographic origin, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (<150 bp) and American isolates having telomeres approximately three times as long (>400 bp). Insertions of a URA3 gene near telomeres allowed for accurate analysis of individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telomere lengths consistent with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in length maintenance. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including likely candidate genes and regions with no known genes involved in telomeric properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes. Reciprocal hemizygosity validated YKU80 and TLC1 as telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer was found to generate negative epistasis in one allelic combination, resulting in very short telomeres. The study suggests that telomere length is a complex trait controlled by multiple loci, with YKU80 and TLC1 being key regulators of telomere length in S. paradoxus.
The article discusses the limitations of sequential sampling models (SSMs) in predicting response times (RTs) in decision-making tasks. SSMs assume that decisions emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process, making RTs predictable. However, when participants are allowed to sample information sequentially and are not forced to respond immediately, the standard SSM approach fails to accurately describe RT distributions. To address this issue, the authors developed an extended SSM that incorporates a mechanism for postponing decisions, which provided an accurate fit to the data from two independent studies using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The studies involved participants making value-based decisions on fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies, indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited, supporting the existence of a decision not to decide. The extended model also accounted for the results of an adapted version of the paradigm where participants had to press a button to sample more information. The findings suggest that computational modeling of decisions and RTs supports a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition. The authors propose that factors such as the number of cues and presentation time influence how long people postpone their decision process.
A mutation in the SUV39H2 gene has been identified as the causative genetic defect for hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK) in Labrador Retrievers. HNPK is a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum of affected dogs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 13 HNPK cases and 23 controls, which revealed a strong association signal on chromosome 2. The analysis of shared haplotypes among the cases defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb containing 25 predicted genes. Re-sequencing of the genome of one case identified a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, which encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase. The variant, c.972T>G, is predicted to change an evolutionary conserved asparagine to a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme (p.N324K). This mutation is associated with the HNPK phenotype in a cohort of over 500 dogs. Histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo suggests that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. The study provides evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.
The study investigated the emergence of transmissible reassortants between avian and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs) during co-infection in swine. A total of 571 isolates were recovered from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of pigs co-housed with IAV-seronegative, avian H1N1 IAV-infected, and swine H3N2 IAV-infected pigs. The results showed that 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants were identified, with the largest genomic diversity found in viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts exhibited the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells, and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells appeared to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. The study suggests that genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, and tissue tropism plays a crucial role in selecting for a transmissible reassortant. The findings have implications for understanding the emergence of pandemic strains and the potential for feral swine to serve as an intermediate host for generating and transmitting reassortant viruses to domestic swine and humans.
The study investigated the effects of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistosoma mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. A total of 1343 children were examined, and 32 (2.4%) were found to have S. mansoni infection based on a single stool sample. The prevalence of infection did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma antigens were higher among infected children compared to uninfected children. Praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to Schistosoma worm antigen (SWA), which were higher in offspring of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy. The study found no evidence that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy influence the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection or effector immune response to S. mansoni infection among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
Inflammatory stimuli induce a reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, allowing for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming is mediated by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol ( PI ) -3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake. Coronin 1 phosphorylation is the key molecular switch that reprograms the macrophage from a phagocytic uptake mode to macropinocytosis. Expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. Macrophages expressing a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 are able to internalize large amounts of cargo for direct transfer to lysosomes, resulting in the elimination of infectious material. This process is distinct from constitutive macropinocytosis, which is unaltered by the activation state of the macrophages. The induction of macropinocytosis through cytokine-mediated macrophage activation is an efficient strategy for the host immune defense to clear large amounts of extracellular material and eradicate pathogenic material.
A qualitative study was conducted in Arua District, North West Uganda, to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of tsetse control baits among local communities. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages, four of which had previous experience with tsetse control programs and four that had not. The results showed that community members who had never seen tsetse baits before expressed fear, anxiety, and panic, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river," which are traditionally linked with physical or mental illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits. The study suggests that acceptance of tsetse control baits varies markedly between villages and is related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The success of community-based interventions against tsetse will depend on early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in areas new to such interventions. The study highlights the importance of community acceptance in the effectiveness of tsetse control programs, as seen in previous examples where negative attitudes led to operational failure.
This study provides the first high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination rates in Drosophila melanogaster, distinguishing between crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC) outcomes of meiotic recombination. A total of 5,860 female meioses were characterized by genotyping 139 million informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in the mapping of 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases. This approach enabled the creation of whole-genome CO and GC maps, as well as a detailed description of recombination rate variation among individuals. The study reveals multiple levels of variation in recombination rates, including large-scale (100 kb) hotspots and coldspots, as well as intra-specific variation associated with hotspots at low frequency. Gene conversion rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and are detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. Recombination events are associated with sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study highlights the importance of considering these non-independent layers of variation in recombination when estimating recombination rates and modeling the interaction between selection and linkage in population genetics. The findings underscore the potential for selection to act on or be associated with recombination modifiers, altering the landscape of recombination rates across the genome.
The study investigated the role of IDN2 and its paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2, in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis thaliana. IDN2 was previously identified as a component of the RdDM machinery, but its function remained unknown. Affinity purification of IDN2 co-purified IDP1 and IDP2, two IDN2 paralogs. The coiled-coil domain between the XS and XH domains of IDN2 is essential for IDN2 homodimerization, while the XH domain is required for IDN2 interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. Complementation testing revealed that the XH domain of IDN2 is necessary for IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex formation and IDN2 function. IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, while IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting distinct roles in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex. The IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex is essential for RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing in vivo. Mutations in the XH domain of IDN2 resulted in failure to complement the DNA methylation defect of idn2 at a canonical RdDM target, demonstrating the importance of the XH domain for IDN2 function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing.
Neutrophils, the first line of defense against invading pathogens, play a crucial role in combating Leishmania braziliensis infection. In this study, researchers investigated the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis to understand how neutrophils respond to the parasite. The results showed that inoculation of serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes in mice induced neutrophil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, exposure of neutrophils to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and induced the oxidative burst. Neutrophil activation following contact with L. braziliensis was confirmed by the release of TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Furthermore, neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis displayed markers of early apoptosis. The study also found that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact on parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection. The findings suggest that neutrophils play a significant role in combating L. braziliensis infection and that their response to the parasite may influence the outcome of the infection.
Vaccination for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle is not currently used in international control programs due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds, and countries are bTB-free. However, new diagnostic tests that can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) offer the potential to introduce vaccination within existing eradication programs. Using within-herd transmission models estimated from historical data from Great Britain, the study explores the feasibility of using vaccination as a supplementary control measure. The economic impact of bTB on farmers is dominated by the costs associated with testing and associated restrictions on animal movements. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination will require it to not only reduce the burden of infection but also the risk of restrictions being imposed. The study finds that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to seeing a herd-level benefit of vaccination. A DIVA specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of missed infection. The study estimates that a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve this target specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% relative to post-mortem detection. The results suggest that vaccination could be a useful supplementary control measure for bTB in cattle, particularly when used in combination with DIVA testing.
A new class of anthelmintic compounds, dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-ones, has been identified as a potential treatment for trichuriasis, a parasitic infection caused by Trichuris trichiura that affects approximately 500 million people worldwide. Trichuris muris, an established model for T. trichiura, was used to screen a library of 480 novel drug-like small molecules for compounds that cause paralysis of the adult parasite. A total of 20 dihydrobenzoxazepinones were identified as active against T. muris, with EC50 values comparable to the existing anthelmintic levamisole. These compounds demonstrated low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells, indicating selectivity for the parasite. Furthermore, one of the most active compounds, OX02983, was shown to reduce the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo. This suggests that dihydrobenzoxazepinones may be effective not only against adult parasites but also against the parasite lifecycle. The dihydrobenzoxazepinones represent a novel family of anthelmintics with considerable scope for further optimization to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties. The discovery of this new class of compounds provides a promising lead for the development of a novel oral pharmaceutical treatment for trichuriasis.
The study revisits the concept of date and party hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, which were previously proposed to have distinct roles in network connectivity. Date hubs are characterized by low co-expression with their interaction partners, while party hubs have high co-expression. However, the study finds that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of extremely central hubs, which do not display low expression correlation with their partners. This challenges the idea that date hubs are global connectors and party hubs are local coordinators. The study also shows that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date/party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Furthermore, topological properties of hubs do not generally correlate with co-expression. In contrast, the study finds significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins. The results suggest that the date/party dichotomy is not meaningful, and it may be more useful to consider roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. The study's findings have implications for understanding the organization and function of protein interaction networks.
The article discusses the limitations of using whole genome sequence (WGS) data to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks. While WGS data can provide valuable information on individual transmission events for rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses, it may not be informative for pathogens with low genetic diversity. The authors introduce the concept of "transmission divergence" as a measure of the number of mutations separating pathogen genomes sampled from transmission pairs. They simulate outbreak scenarios using two models of sequence evolution to estimate transmission divergence for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile. The results show that many outbreaks are characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs, resulting in low transmission divergence. This limited genetic diversity hinders the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using WGS data. The authors demonstrate the impact of transmission divergence on two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages outbreaker and phybreak, and highlight the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The study emphasizes the importance of considering transmission divergence when evaluating the informativeness of WGS data for reconstructing transmission chains during infectious disease outbreaks.
The study investigated the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in mouse tissues and cells. XCI is a process by which one X chromosome is silenced in female mammals, but some genes escape this silencing. The researchers analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI. They used a binomial model to assess allelic expression and identified a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi). The study found that few genes (3-7%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. However, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21%), representing both kidney-specific escape genes and cell-line specific escape genes. The study also found that allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. Additionally, allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line, possibly contributing to a more compartmentalized structure of the Xi and fewer escape genes in brain compared to the cell line. The findings suggest that XCI and escape from XCI are tightly controlled in vivo and that escape genes may be candidates for tissue-specific sex differences.
A novel cysteine protease of Plasmodium vivax, designated as Vivapain-4 (VX-4), has been characterized and its biochemical properties investigated. VX-4 is one of four closely related cysteine protease genes identified in P. vivax, with orthologs showing differential evolution in primate and rodent Plasmodium species. Recombinant VX-4 demonstrated dual substrate specificity, with optimal activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Z-Leu-Arg-MCA) and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA at acidic pH (5.5), and against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA at neutral pH (6.5-7.5). VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. The enzyme was localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax. VX-4 showed maximal activity against actin at neutral pH, and against P. vivax plasmepsin 4 and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. These findings suggest that VX-4 may function as a hemoglobinase in the acidic parasite food vacuole, a maturase of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 at neutral or acidic pH, and a cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the neutral erythrocyte cytosol. The characterization of VX-4 provides insights into the biochemical properties of P. vivax cysteine proteases and may aid in the development of antimalarial drugs targeting these enzymes.
A novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) has been reconstructed for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The ME-model, named iJL965-ME, captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesize RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. This model represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology. The ME-model accurately predicted the secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, during changing carbon and metal availability. It also revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens. Furthermore, the model predicted changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, providing new knowledge about proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens. The ME-model was used to explore the energetics of autotrophic growth in C. ljungdahlii, which was poorly understood due to the lack of ATP gain at the substrate level and the absence of cytochrome-encoding genes in some acetogens. The model suggests that proton exportation can be coupled to ferredoxin oxidation and NAD+ reduction by the Rnf complex, providing a new understanding of energy conservation in acetogens.
The study investigated the genetic control of transcript isoform variation in human osteoblasts (HObs) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). A panel of HObs was used to perform a transcriptomic survey, similar to recent studies in LCLs. The results showed that HObs and LCLs have distinct gene expression profiles, with preferential grouping of cell type-specific genes within biologically and functionally relevant pathways unique to each tissue type. Cis-association analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes identified genetic variations of transcript isoforms in HObs, indicating that differential expression of transcript isoforms is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These isoforms are regulated by genetic variants in both a tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion, and the associations were confirmed by RT-PCR validation. The study found that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both tissues and that genetic control may affect the relative expression of one isoform to another, rather than having an all-or-none effect. Examination of the top SNPs from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bone mineral density showed overlap with probeset associations observed in this study. A novel transcript isoform variant was identified in the FAM118A gene, which was tested for association in two additional clinical studies. The approach used in this study is useful for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and for identifying cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant, an important follow-up step for GWAS.
Saccharomyces eubayanus, the non- Saccharomyces cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus, is unable to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. In contrast to most Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Frohberg-type Saccharomyces pastorianus strains, S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T harbors four SeMALT genes that enable uptake of the α-di-glucoside maltose, but lacks maltotriose transporter genes. To study the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 12357T, maltotriose-assimilating mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis were subjected to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of Saccharomyces pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequence identity to alternatingly Saccharomyces cerevisiae MALx1, Saccharomyces paradoxus MALx1 and Saccharomyces eubayanus SeMALT3. Evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus lager-brewing strains is likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in this study.
A novel host-virus interaction model has been proposed to establish a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by influenza virus strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each subtype of seasonal influenza viruses. This relationship has enabled the development of a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A ( H1N1 ) strains based on their HA sequences. A simplified host-virus interaction model was used to explore the relationship between antigenic variations of influenza viruses and the excess mortalities they cause. The model considered strains of distinct antigenicity that cause significant infection in the human population, denoted as “antigenic strains”. Using this model, a direct and positive correlation was found between the extent of antigenic variation of an influenza virus and the total excess mortality it may cause. The proposed method has the potential to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus and is also applicable to the antigenic variants of human A ( H3N2 ) and B viruses with proper modification. The accuracy of the predicted antigenic distance was evaluated and found to be relatively high, suggesting its potential utility in the rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden. This method is expected to be useful for rapid assessment of the influenza mortality burden of future A ( H1N1 ) variants and for formulating a cost-effective response for influenza control and prevention.
The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that causes severe soybean disease epidemics. A small cysteine-rich protein, PpEC23, secreted by P. pachyrhizi, has been identified as a virulence factor that suppresses plant immunity. PpEC23 interacts with the soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l, a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Silencing GmSPL12l in soybeans results in constitutively active immunity, indicating that GmSPL12l functions as an immune suppressor. The interaction between PpEC23 and GmSPL12l suggests that PpEC23 may be a representative of a conserved protein-protein interaction platform used by rust fungi to manipulate host immune responses. The tandem repeat of a ten-cysteine motif in PpEC23 is a characteristic feature of a cluster 112 protein family widely present in rust fungal species. PpEC23 has been shown to suppress hypersensitive response (HR) and basal defense responses in soybeans, indicating its potential role in promoting P. pachyrhizi virulence. The identification of PpEC23 as a virulence factor expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between P. pachyrhizi and its host plant. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional redundancy of P. pachyrhizi effector proteins and the role of GmSPL12l in regulating soybean immunity.
The study identifies EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) as a host cell surface receptor exploited by Chlamydia trachomatis for invasion and intracellular signaling. Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. The bacterium induces a long-lasting activation of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is essential for efficient replication. EphA2, a cell surface tyrosine kinase, is shown to be a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3K activation, promoting chlamydial replication. Interfering with the binding of C. trachomatis serovar L2 (Ctr) to EphA2, downregulating EphA2 expression, or inhibiting EphA2 activity significantly reduces Ctr infection. Ctr interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, resulting in Ctr and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active, accumulating around the inclusion and interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overexpression of full-length EphA2, but not a mutant form lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain, enhances PI3K activation and Ctr infection. The study also shows that Ctr infection induces upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, keeping the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. The findings provide evidence for a host cell surface receptor exploited for invasion and intracellular signaling to facilitate chlamydial replication.
Biomedical research has shown that neurons exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of voltage-gated ion channels in their dendrites. However, the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained unclear. A recent study proposes that the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances is to enhance the dynamic range of neurons. The dynamic range refers to the ability of a neuron to detect and amplify weak signals while saturating slowly for stronger inputs. The study used a model of an active dendritic tree and found that its average output is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, resulting in extremely large dynamic ranges (above 50 dB). The model also yielded double-sigmoid response functions, which have been experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. The study suggests that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges and that blocking active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range. The results propose that active dendrites can amplify weak signals and saturate slowly for stronger inputs, making them essential for signal processing in individual neurons, neural networks, sensory organs, and organisms. The study's findings provide new insights into the functional role of active dendritic conductances and their importance in neural computation.
The inference of regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data is a widely used approach in drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. However, existing methods often rely on implicit assumptions that may not be valid, such as equating mRNA abundance with protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects. This study systematically investigates the importance of these assumptions and proposes corrections using a combination of models and experiments. The authors measured in real-time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network and estimated protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression. The results indicate that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. Furthermore, simulations suggest that these improvements are expected to be even stronger for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene expression machinery activity. The study proposes new controls for transcriptome experiments, including the use of constitutively-expressed genes and mathematical models for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating global physiological effects into the network inference process. The authors demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters. The approach is broadly applicable to time-series transcriptome data and has implications for understanding the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks.
This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O. fulvescens), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America, in the Agua Buena region of Panama. A longitudinal study of rodent populations was conducted between April 2006 and December 2009, using a 90-node grid to analyze the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of O. fulvescens. The results showed heterogeneous patterns in population densities and degrees of dispersion that varied across seasons and among years. The species was typically absent during the late transitional months of the season, but re-established locally in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that local populations encompassed approximately 300-600 m, with sharply demarcated borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The study found that O. fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, leading to a pattern of changing aggregation. Hotspots of abundance showed a general shifting pattern, which helps explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. The variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities. These factors define the characteristics of the occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations and possible exposure that local human populations experience. The study provides an important characterization of the challenges in monitoring or predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations.
The article presents a computational method for inferring genotype-phenotype relationships in the antigenic evolution of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses. The method, based on a least-squares optimization (LSO) procedure, fits pairwise antigenic distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree for the major antigenic determinant of influenza A. This approach allows for a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual changes than antigenic cartography without the need for time- and cost-intensive experiments. The method was applied to infer antigenic trees representing the antigenic evolution of the major surface protein of human influenza A virus (H3N2) over a 35-year period. The results showed that the technique predicted antigenic distances with comparable accuracy to antigenic cartography and identified both known and novel sites, as well as amino acid changes with antigenic impact in the evolution of influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003. The method can also be applied to the study of other systems, both within and across species, where homologous genetic sequences and associated pairwise phenotype distances are available. The technique has the potential to aid in the production of efficient vaccines by identifying isolates and associated changes with large antigenic impact, which need to be identified for vaccine strain updates prior to antigenic type transitions.
A large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen was conducted to identify host cell factors and processes involved in human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. The study revealed that nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) during mitosis is crucial for the nuclear import of the viral DNA (vDNA) genome. In interphase cells, HPV16 is endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but the vDNA fails to be imported into the nucleus. However, upon nuclear envelope perforation in interphase cells, HPV16 infection occurs. During mitosis, the vDNA and L2 protein associate with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate. The results suggest that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. This study highlights the importance of mitosis in HPV16 nuclear entry and provides a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies. The findings also underscore the value of RNAi screens in analyzing pathogen-host interactions. Furthermore, the study reveals that HPV16 causes a significant increase in the fraction of cells that display prolonged mitosis, which may be a mechanism for the virus to promote vDNA import into nuclei.
The Dothideomycete fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, previously known as Mycosphaerella fijiensis, causes Black Sigatoka or black leaf streak disease, the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to the lack of effective host resistance, management of this disease requires frequent fungicide applications, leading to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains and significant economic and environmental costs. To combat this threat, the genomes of two P. fijiensis strains, CIRAD86 and CIRAD139, were sequenced and assembled using a new genetic linkage map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is characterized by a massive expansion of LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, also show similar expansions. Genetic analysis revealed chromosome-length polymorphisms and high genetic diversity in P. fijiensis field populations, indicating strong selection and limited gene flow. The study identified a homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, in the P. fijiensis genome, which triggered a hypersensitive-like response in the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4. This finding suggests that Calcutta 4 may carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAvr4. The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules and improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. Diversifying and increasing host resistance in banana may be the only way to slow the devastation caused by this fungus in the future.
A novel framework has been developed to study the evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species alignments. This framework utilizes a birth-death model to trace the evolution of binding sites and was applied to analyze ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors ( GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1 ) along the human lineage after the human-mouse common ancestor. The results show that a substantial fraction of binding sites ( ∼58–79% for each factor ) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse, and over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These lineage-specific elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. The method generates motif predictions specifically using lineage-specific binding sites and has been shown to be effective in identifying regulatory elements that contribute to species-specific traits. In contrast to conservation-based approaches, this method does not rely on fixed cross-species alignments, which are frequently of low quality within non-coding regions of the genome. The results provide strong support for the ability of this novel method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and shed light on their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.
The study investigated how light regulates the expression of the zebrafish period2 (per2) gene, which plays a key role in mediating the effects of light on the circadian clock. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line-based assays, the researchers identified a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter that is necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements, which are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. TEF mRNA levels are light-inducible, and knockdown of TEF expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. These findings support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. The study reveals a novel mechanism that combines light-induced and clock-regulated transcriptional control, which may lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon of gated light entrainment of the circadian clock and other general photic cellular responses. The LRM sequence is conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks, and the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells.
The actin filament-binding protein coronin plays a crucial role in regulating gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite. Sporozoites lacking coronin exhibit motility defects that impair colonization of the mosquito salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner, and its relocalization to the rear of the gliding sporozoite is triggered by an intracellular calcium release following engagement of extracellular ligands. Coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility and is essential for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly, and calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. The study highlights the importance of coronin in Plasmodium sporozoite motility and transmission, and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. The findings also suggest a crucial interplay between TRAP-family adhesins, actin filaments, and actin-regulating proteins for adhesion formation as a prerequisite for sporozoite migration.
Genomic instability at the locus of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) has been linked to amphotericin B (AmB) resistance in Leishmania parasites. AmB is a crucial drug in the fight against leishmaniasis, but the emergence of resistance poses a significant threat. Researchers characterized four novel AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines and found that all exhibited altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that one line had a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase, while three lines had reduced expression of SMT, which is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. The loss of SMT expression was associated with structural variations at the SMT locus, including the loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy. This instability is mediated by local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. Notably, the loss of SMT expression was not associated with a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo. This finding is concerning, as repeat sequence-mediated instability is known in Leishmania genomes, and its presence associated with resistance to a major antileishmanial drug with no evidence of associated fitness costs is a significant concern. The identification of SMT as a key player in AmB resistance highlights the need to monitor for emergent resistance and the potential for low-level resistance to predispose to higher-level resistance through the accumulation of additional mutations.
The study investigated the interaction between attention and prediction in the neural encoding of sensory information in the human brain. Using electroencephalography (EEG), participants performed a simple visual task where they attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The results showed that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. Specifically, attention boosted mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli, which is consistent with a recent version of predictive coding theory that proposes attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by increasing the gain of prediction errors. This theory, known as the "mismatch information model," suggests that attention increases selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli relative to unsurprising stimuli. In contrast, alternative predictive coding models propose that predictions, rather than prediction errors, are propagated forward through the visual hierarchy and modulated by attention. The study's findings support the "mismatch information model" and provide new insights into how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain.
Differences between Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Groups 1 and 2 in Their Resistance to Killing by Trypanolytic Factor 1
    Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a subspecies of the parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, exhibits two distinct groups with varying levels of resistance to human serum. Group 1 T. b. gambiense has an invariant phenotype and is resistant to trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF-1), while group 2 T. b. gambiense shows variable resistance. Previous studies suggested that group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to TLF-1 due to reduced expression of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR) gene, which mediates TLF-1 uptake. However, this study found that isogenic resistant and sensitive group 2 T. b. gambiense lines express the HpHbR gene at similar levels and internalize fluorescently labeled TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. b. brucei. Both resistant and sensitive group 2 T. b. gambiense, as well as group 1 T. b. gambiense, internalize recombinant APOL1, but only sensitive group 2 parasites are lysed. The results indicate that group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as group 1 T. b. gambiense. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype, and expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR. Therefore, there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
DNA methylation of the HIV-1 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) has been investigated as a potential mechanism of transcriptional suppression to evade host immune responses and antiretroviral drugs. However, the role of DNA methylation in HIV-1 latency has remained unclear. This study demonstrates that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and determines the stability of HIV-1 latency. In an in vitro model of reactivable latency and in a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients, CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR was found to be a late event during establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for initial provirus silencing. The latent reservoir of some aviremic patients contained high proportions of non-methylated 5′ LTR, while the latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and chromatin-dependent mechanisms was found to be leaky and easily reactivable. In contrast, the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable plasma viremia showed HIV-1 promoters and enhancers to be hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation. However, even dense methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation with certain histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein kinase C agonists, and their combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. The study proposes a two-step model of epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency, suggesting that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an important epigenetic mechanism that maintains HIV-1 latency by preventing reactivation.
The study presents a comprehensive catalog of genomic variations in Drosophila melanogaster, including single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants, in 39 inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Using an integrative, local assembly-based approach, the researchers identified over 3.6 million distinct variants, with more than 800,000 unique insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The study reveals a high density of molecular polymorphisms in Drosophila, with a SNP every 43 bp and an indel or complex variant every 144 bp, contributing a genetic marker every 33 bp on average. Deletions and complex variants affect 4.2% of the reference euchromatic genome, while insertions add 2.1 Mb.

The researchers also investigated the impact of these variants on gene expression, mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for over 2,000 genes. Indels comprise around 10% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. The study found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, revealing a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between the sexes. Additionally, the researchers performed RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, validating the majority of strong cis-eQTLs in heterozygous individuals. These findings provide insights into the complexity and evolution of the cis-regulatory architecture of gene expression in Drosophila and highlight the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression.
This study investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on the correlation between the neural drive to muscle and the rectified electromyography (EMG) signal. Amplitude cancellation occurs when motor unit action potentials overlap, resulting in a loss of EMG amplitude. The researchers used analytical derivations and a computational model to examine the effect of amplitude cancellation on the correlation between the neural drive and the rectified EMG signal. The results showed that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMGnc) is a superior estimator of the neural drive to muscle compared to the actual rectified EMG signal. However, the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive decreased linearly with increasing amplitude cancellation. The simulations also demonstrated that a stronger neural drive resulted in a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, and that amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components of the neural drive. The study found that amplitude cancellation impairs the ability of the rectified EMG signal to reflect the neural drive to muscle, except in conditions with low contraction levels and/or highly variable common synaptic input. The results suggest that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons. The study highlights the importance of considering amplitude cancellation when using the rectified EMG signal to infer sources of synaptic input to motor neurons.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, aluminium (Al) stress inhibits root growth, and auxin plays a crucial role in this process. However, the molecular mechanism controlling auxin-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress is not fully understood. This study reveals that YUCCA (YUC), a flavin monooxygenase-like protein, regulates local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al stress upregulates YUC3, YUC5, YUC7, YUC8, and YUC9 in the root-apex TZ, leading to auxin accumulation and root growth inhibition. The Al-dependent changes in YUC regulation and root growth inhibition are dependent on ethylene signalling. Increasing or disrupting ethylene signalling enhances or reduces upregulation of YUCs in the root-apex TZ, respectively. Ethylene also enhances root growth inhibition under Al stress, which is alleviated in yuc mutants or by co-treatment with yucasin, an inhibitor of YUC activity. Furthermore, ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) is involved in the direct regulation of YUC9 transcription, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) functions as a transcriptional activator for YUC5, YUC8, and YUC9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating local expression of YUCs and auxin signalling in the root-apex TZ. The Al-induced expression of PIF4 in the root TZ acts downstream of ethylene signalling. These findings highlight a regulatory cascade for YUCs-regulated local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ mediating root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.
This study investigated the interaction between simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) peptides and natural killer ( NK ) cells in rhesus macaques. The researchers found that certain SIV peptides bound to the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecule Mamu-A1*002 can suppress the cytolytic activity of NK cells expressing the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR ) Mamu-KIR3DL05. Twenty-eight out of 75 SIV peptides bound by Mamu-A1*002 inhibited the killing activity of Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes. Substitutions at the C-terminal positions of these peptides changed their inhibitory effects to disinhibitory effects, and vice versa, without altering their binding to Mamu-A1*002. The functional effects of these peptide variants on NK cell responses corresponded to their effects on Mamu-A1*002 tetramer binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05. In assays with mixtures of inhibitory and disinhibitory peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory peptides dominated to suppress NK cell responses. Consistent with the inhibition of Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells by viral epitopes presented by Mamu-A1*002, SIV replication was significantly higher in Mamu-A1*002+ CD4+ lymphocytes co-cultured with Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells than with Mamu-KIR3DL05- NK cells. These results demonstrate that viral peptides can modulate NK cell responses by modulating MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may evade NK cell responses.
Bacterial pathogens, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ), must adapt to dynamic microenvironmental stressors to survive and establish chronic infection. A study investigated the microevolution of NTHI in response to transient heme-iron restriction and its impact on intracellular bacterial community ( IBC ) development and persistence. The researchers hypothesized that strains adapted to nutrient limitation are more adept at colonization and evasion of host immune responses, leading to persistence. To test this hypothesis, they created a mutant strain of NTHI with a mutation in the icc gene, which results in decreased 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity. In a preclinical model of NTHI-induced otitis media ( OM ), the icc mutant strain formed significantly more IBCs than the parental strain early during experimental OM. In contrast, the parental strain formed few IBCs at early stages of OM, but a significant increase was observed at later stages that coincided with the absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting the presence of a mucosal reservoir following resolution of clinical disease. The study provides the first insight into NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrates the formation of IBCs in a preclinical model of chronic OM. These findings suggest that adaptation to nutrient limitation can enhance the ability of NTHI to form IBCs and persist in the host.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudomallei resulted in downregulation of ferroportin, leading to increased iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export function by hepcidin or iron supplementation by ferric ammonium citrate stimulated B. pseudomallei growth, whereas the iron chelator deferoxamine reduced bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibited a lower expression of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokines, and activation of caspase-1. Infection of mice with B. pseudomallei caused a diminished hepatic ferroportin expression, higher iron retention in the liver, and lower iron levels in the serum (hypoferremia). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate tended to promote bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas limitation of iron availability significantly ameliorated bacterial clearance, attenuated serum cytokine levels, and improved survival of infected mice. The study suggests that modulation of the cellular iron balance is a strategy of B. pseudomallei to improve iron acquisition and restrict antibacterial immune effector mechanisms, promoting its intracellular growth. Furthermore, changes in host iron homeostasis can influence susceptibility to melioidosis, and iron chelating drugs may be an additional therapeutic option.
A novel technique termed “functional mode analysis” (FMA) has been proposed to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to a specific protein function. FMA is based on an ensemble of structures and an arbitrary “functional quantity” that quantifies the functional state of the protein. The technique detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity, which can be a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable. Two correlation measures are applied: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures linear correlation, and the mutual information, which can assess any kind of interdependence. The maximally correlated motion is used to derive a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. FMA is complementary to established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA), which elucidate large-scale and low-frequency modes, respectively, but do not necessarily yield collective motions directly related to protein function. FMA is expected to elucidate relations between collective motions and protein function for proteins that accomplish their biological function by structural transitions such as hinge motions, domain rotations, or side chain reorientations. The technique is illustrated using a number of biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein.
This study investigated the order of intron removal from nuclear transcripts of Euglena gracilis, a eukaryotic organism that harbors atypical, nonconventional introns not found in other eukaryotes. Nonconventional introns lack conserved borders and sequence complementary to U1 snRNA, forming a stable secondary structure that does not resemble self-splicing or tRNA introns. In Euglena gracilis, nonconventional introns frequently insert at new positions, while conventional introns are either found at conserved positions or lost. The study examined the relative order of intron excision from transcripts of the tubA and gapC genes, which contain both nonconventional and spliceosomal introns. Using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing, the analysis revealed that nonconventional introns are removed rapidly but later than spliceosomal introns. Furthermore, the accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional introns present suggests a time gap between the two types of splicing. This study provides new insights into the splicing process in Euglena gracilis and highlights the unique characteristics of nonconventional introns in eukaryotic organisms. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution and function of introns in eukaryotic genomes. The study also underscores the need for further research on the whole-genome survey of nonconventional introns in Euglena gracilis and other eukaryotic organisms.
The Impact of Juvenile Coxsackievirus Infection on Cardiac Progenitor Cells and Postnatal Heart Development
    A mouse model of juvenile coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection was established to investigate the effects of mild infection on cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and postnatal heart development. Mice infected with a subclinical dose of CVB3 at three days old showed no immediate symptoms, but when subjected to cardiac stress in adulthood, they developed cardiac hypertrophy and dilation, indicative of progression to heart failure. Evaluation of the vasculature in the hearts of adult mice revealed a compensatory increase in CD31+ blood vessel formation, which was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Furthermore, CVB3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor cell numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected adult mice. These results suggest that the exhausted cardiac progenitor cell pool following juvenile CVB3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load. The study provides evidence that a self-limited juvenile CVB3 infection may have lasting effects on the ability of adult mice to undergo compensatory vascular remodeling under cardiac stress. The findings also indicate that CVB3 preferentially targets CPCs in the juvenile heart, leading to a sustained reduction in the CPC pool into adulthood.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, regulates IL-1β and IL-18 production through NOD-like receptors NLRP3 and NLRC4, leading to pyroptosis. However, the downstream signaling pathways of these receptors and other cell death mechanisms induced during B. pseudomallei infection are not well understood. This study investigated the role of caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death pathways in macrophages infected with B. pseudomallei. The results show that caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis are exclusively dependent on NLRC4, but not NLRP3, in the early phase of macrophage infection. At later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death are NLRC4-independent. An activation pathway involving caspases-9, -7, and PARP downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1 was identified in the early phase of infection. Caspase-1/11-deficient infected macrophages exhibited a strong induction of apoptosis, which is dependent on activation of apoptotic initiator and effector caspases. The early activation pathway of caspase-1 in macrophages was reduced or abolished after infection with a B. pseudomallei flagellin FliC or a T3SS3 BsaU mutant. The T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK mutant failed to activate caspase-1, resulting in higher intracellular counts, reduced cell death, and IL-1β secretion during early but not late macrophage infection. Intranasal infection of BALB/c mice with the BsaK mutant displayed decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads in organs, and reduced levels of IL-1β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The results indicate a major role for a functional T3SS3 in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis and a contribution of late caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection.
The Arabidopsis KINβγ subunit of the SnRK1 complex plays a crucial role in regulating pollen hydration on the stigma by mediating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. KINβγ is a plant-specific subunit of the SNF1-related protein kinase 1 complex, which is involved in the regulation of plant development. In Arabidopsis, KINβγ was found to be localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vegetative cells in pollen grains. Mutations in the KINβγ gene resulted in defective pollen germination on the stigma, although pollen germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised, and adding water to the stigma promoted germination of the mutant pollen in vivo. The structure and number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in mutant pollen were significantly reduced compared to wild-type pollen. Moreover, the mutant pollen exhibited reduced levels of ROS. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen, and reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing Arabidopsis CATALASE 3 resulted in compromised hydration of pollen on the stigma. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is essential for regulating ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is necessary for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination.
The essential function of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis is to protect the organism from the expression of toxin genes borne by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through the degradation of double-stranded RNA. Unlike in other bacteria, the RNase III gene is essential for the survival of B. subtilis, as its absence leads to the expression of toxin-encoding mRNAs txpA and yonT, resulting in cell death. These toxin-encoding mRNAs are sensitive to RNase III and are cleaved by the enzyme in the presence of their antisense RNA, RatA. The mechanism of RNase III-mediated decay of the txpA mRNA has been explored in vivo and in vitro. The essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is distinct from its function in rRNA metabolism and maturation, as other enzymes, such as RNase J1, Mini-III, and RNase M5, can efficiently process rRNA precursors in the absence of RNase III. Furthermore, RNase III does not significantly contribute to the stability of many known antisense RNAs in B. subtilis. This study highlights the unique role of RNase III in B. subtilis as a defense mechanism against viral infection, which is distinct from its functions in other organisms, including eukaryotes, where RNase III domains are involved in RNA interference and microRNA generation.
The filarial nematode Brugia malayi, the causative agent of Lymphatic Filariasis, has been found to release extracellular vesicles (EVs) across all stages of its life cycle, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male, and female worms. These EVs are internalized by murine macrophages through phagocytosis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, indicating sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. Ivermectin was found to rapidly inhibit EV release by all Brugia life stages, and this effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate of that parasite. The morphology of the parasite-derived vesicles was examined using negative stain electron microscopy, revealing round single vesicles with a "cup-shaped" or "donut" morphology consistent with exosome-like vesicles. The study suggests that Brugia malayi uses EVs to release effector molecules that facilitate the establishment or maintenance of parasitemia, and that ivermectin may exert its anti-filarial effects by inhibiting EV release. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which filarial nematodes modulate host biology and highlight the potential for EVs as a target for anti-filarial drug development.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ten rural villages of the Western Province of the Solomon Islands to determine the prevalence of scabies and impetigo. The study enrolled 1908 participants, who were interviewed and examined by a pediatric registrar. The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% CI 17.5-21.0), with the highest prevalence found in infants < 1 year of age (34.1%) and children aged 1-4 years (25.7%). Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants, and 4.4% of cases were classified as severe. The total unweighted prevalence of active impetigo was 32.7% (95% CI 30.6-34.8), with the highest prevalence found in children aged 1-4 years (42.6%). Scabies infestation was associated with active impetigo infection (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6-2.6), with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. The study found that scabies and impetigo are common in the rural Western Province of the Solomon Islands, with scabies infestation being a significant risk factor for the development of active impetigo. These conditions place a great burden on the communities, with clinical management of individual cases consuming a significant proportion of limited health resources. The study highlights the need for community control strategies for scabies to reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.
A recent study investigated the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the adult hippocampus of mice. The research revealed a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. This correlation was found to be driven by shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus, which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. The study used a large stock of outbred mice to analyze the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. The results showed that higher levels of hippocampal proliferation were associated with a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells and lower proportions of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. This correlation accounted for about 6% of the phenotypic variance. The study also found that the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus was not an artefact of transgenic or knockout mice, but rather arose from natural genetic variation. Analysis of knockouts and repopulation of TCRα-deficient mice by subsets of T cells confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect. These findings suggest a broader role for T cell function on adult neurogenesis than previously suspected.
The study investigated the prophylactic efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine, TcVac2, against Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, in a murine model. TcVac2 was constituted of antigens identified by computational analysis of the T. cruzi sequence database and cytokine expression plasmids. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuvants, followed by recombinant proteins, and then challenged with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. The results showed that TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, the antibody response persisted, and splenic activation of CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ/TNF-α cytokines subsided, while IL-4/IL-10 cytokines became dominant in vaccinated mice. Histological analysis revealed undetectable tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated chronic mice. In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi with a mixed (type 1/type 2) antibody, T cell, and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection and prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Title: From Disease Association to Risk Assessment: An Optimistic View from Genome-Wide Association Studies on Type 1 Diabetes

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, a remaining challenge is to quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data to facilitate personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to the limited number of confirmed susceptibility loci used. This study proposes that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers can improve disease risk assessment. The authors applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to a GWAS dataset generated on the Affymetrix genotyping platform for T1D and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. The model was then tested on two independent datasets, one genotyped on the Illumina platform and the other on the Affymetrix platform, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model. The study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. The results indicate that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.
During a secondary viral infection, memory CD8+ T cells rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, to provide protective immunity in an antigen-specific manner. However, the fate of these memory CD8+ T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues is not well understood. This study investigated the role of central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells in providing protective immunity against Vaccinia virus (VacV) infection in the skin. The results show that TCM CD8+ T cells traffic into the skin independently of CD62L-mediated lymph node re-activation and provide robust protective immunity against VacV infection. In contrast to effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells, TCM CD8+ T cells differentiated into functional CD69+/CD103- tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local recognition of antigen in the skin microenvironment. Additionally, memory CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B after trafficking into the skin and utilized cytolysis to provide protective immunity against VacV infection. These findings demonstrate that TCM CD8+ T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and subsequently differentiate into functional CD69+ tissue-residents. Overall, this study provides new insights into the protective mechanisms used by circulating memory CD8+ T cells during a secondary viral infection in peripheral tissues.
The study investigated the role of Myosin VI in the localization of axonal proteins in neurons. Myosin VI is a minus-end-directed motor protein that plays a crucial role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons. The researchers engineered a non-neuronal protein, CD8, to interact with Myosin VI and found that it became highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Conversely, disruption of Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. The study suggests that Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. Furthermore, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI was concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, indicating its potential as a tool for probing circuit structure and function. The results indicate that myosins contribute to the enrichment of both axonal and dendritic proteins at the plasma membranes of the appropriate polar compartments, playing a role in specifying the polarized structure of neurons necessary for proper electrical signaling.
In the freshwater branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, a Doublesex ( Dsx ) gene plays a crucial role in controlling sexual dimorphism during environmental sex determination ( ESD ). Two Dsx genes, DapmaDsx1 and DapmaDsx2, were identified in D. magna, with DapmaDsx1 being responsible for male trait development when expressed during ESD. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of Dsx from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 differs from that of insects, with DapmaDsx1 exhibiting sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre–mRNA splicing. During embryogenesis, DapmaDsx1 expression is increased only in males and its transcripts are primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, including ovarian maturation, while ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. These results establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype in D. magna. The findings reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination ( GSD ), suggesting an ancient link between GSD and ESD.
A trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine was evaluated for its immunogenicity and efficacy in preventing genital herpes in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E ( gC2, gD2, gE2 ) to block virus entry by gD2 and immune evasion by gC2 and gE2. In rhesus macaques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. After intravaginal challenge, a self-limited vaginal infection of brief duration was detected in naïve macaques, but not in trivalent immunized animals. In guinea pigs, the trivalent and trivalent + gD2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious, respectively, in preventing genital lesions and outperformed gD2 alone. The trivalent group had genital lesions on < 1% days and shedding of replication competent virus on 0. 2% days. Vaginal swabs were evaluated daily for HSV-2 DNA and replication competent virus between five and seven weeks after challenge. HSV-2 DNA shedding was reduced in all groups compared with mock, and shedding of replication competent virus occurred on fewer days in the trivalent than gD2 immunized animals. The trivalent + gD2 group had no shedding of replication competent virus. These results suggest that the trivalent vaccine has outstanding potential for prevention of genital herpes in humans.
Title: Perm-seq: Mapping Protein-DNA Interactions in Segmental Duplication and Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Prior-Enhanced Read Mapping

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a high-throughput assay for profiling transcription factor binding and histone modifications. However, segmental duplications and highly repetitive regions of genomes pose a challenge for mapping protein-DNA interactions due to short reads mapping to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard multi-mapping reads, leading to large false positive and negative rates. To address this issue, a prior-enhanced read allocation method, Perm-seq, was developed to allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions with high accuracy. Perm-seq utilizes DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq data and read counts of local neighbourhoods of mapping locations to discriminate between multiple alignment positions of the same read. The method was comprehensively evaluated and found to significantly improve multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. Perm-seq was applied to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells, identifying many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. The analysis revealed that protein-DNA interaction sites in repetitive regions share overall sequence characteristics with those in non-repetitive regions, despite being evolutionarily less conserved. The Perm-seq framework is highly versatile and enables incorporation of multiple sources of data, including histone ChIP-seq, for read allocation.
A nested case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schistosomiasis on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. The study population consisted of adults from seven villages who were tested for HIV in 2007, 2010, and 2013. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistosoma mansoni infection, and 2% had S. haematobium infection. The study found that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition compared to those without ( adjusted OR = 2. 8 [1. 2–6. 6], p = 0. 019 ). In contrast, schistosome-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition ( adjusted OR = 0. 7 [0. 3–1. 8], p = 0. 42 ). The study also found that HIV-1 RNA levels in the post-seroconversion blood spots of HIV-1 seroconverters with schistosomiasis were significantly higher than in those without schistosomiasis ( 4. 4 [3. 9–4. 6] log10 copies/mL versus 3. 7 [3. 2–4. 3], p = 0. 017 ). The results suggest that pre-existing schistosome infection increases the odds of HIV-1 acquisition in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schistosome infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, and to differentiate effects by gender.
The study investigated the copy number and sequence variation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in human and mouse genomes, particularly in cancer states. Using computational and droplet digital PCR approaches, the researchers found that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes showed a loss of rDNA copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. This loss was also observed in hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the study found that cancer genomes with lower rDNA copies had mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor critical for genome stability and a negative regulator of the mTOR kinase pathway, was found to be associated with the loss of rDNA copies. The results suggest that rDNA copy number may be a useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments. The study also found that short-term treatment with an mTOR inhibitor did not alter the rDNA copy number in hematopoietic cancer stem cells, indicating that the loss of rDNA copies is not an immediate event upon loss of PTEN. The findings are consistent with previous studies in budding yeast, which showed that loss of rDNA copies is associated with sensitivity to DNA damage.
The article presents a novel approach to understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts during an infection. By using tagged Salmonella enterica populations (wild-type isogenic tagged strains) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice, researchers were able to map the population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. This approach allowed for the estimation of bacterial death rates based on the disappearance of strains over time. The study revealed that shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection. The study provides an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease. This approach has the potential to transform our understanding of within-host dynamics of pathogen interactions with host cells, providing the information needed to build mechanistic mathematical models, generate new research hypotheses, and make quantitative predictions. The application of this novel method in diverse host-pathogen combinations will facilitate a comprehensive view of the spatial and stochastic nature of within-host dynamics.
Existing models of 3D motion perception are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion. The inverse problem refers to the process of determining the 3D motion of an object from 2D retinal images. Current approaches such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity do not provide a general solution to this problem. The authors suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues offer a more flexible framework for solving the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, the authors derive predictions from two plausible default strategies: the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D and the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion allows for the distinction between these strategies of 3D motion processing. Theoretical results indicate that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are necessary to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. The authors propose that motion and disparity input are processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy. Late integration of motion and disparity constraints in combination with other cues can solve the inverse problem of local 3D motion and allows the visual system to remain flexible when binding and segmenting local inputs from different processing stages into a global 3D motion percept.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the anionic, O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate to form a protective biofilm matrix during chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Four proteins, AlgIJF and AlgX, have been implicated in the O-acetylation of alginate. To elucidate the biological function of AlgJ, its structure was determined to 1.83 Å resolution. AlgJ is a SGNH hydrolase-like protein, structurally similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX, but with a distinct electrostatic surface potential. A conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288 was identified, and AlgJ exhibited acetylesterase activity in vitro. Residues in the AlgJ signature motifs formed an extensive network of interactions critical for O-acetylation of alginate in vivo. In contrast to AlgX, AlgJ showed weak or no detectable binding to polymannuronic acid. AlgX, however, bound polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner and utilized the surrogate acetyl-donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid. The results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX acting as the terminal acetyltransferase. This refined model for alginate acetylation provides a rationale for the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation.
Candida albicans, a common cause of human fungal infections, diminishes its detection by innate immune cells through masking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in the inner cell wall with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoproteins ( mannan ). However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan ( unmasking ) and enhanced detection by innate immune cells through receptors like Dectin-1. A previous study showed that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS ) synthase enzyme ( Cho1 ) plays a role in β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan masking. The homozygous PS synthase knockout mutant, cho1Δ/Δ, exhibits increased exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan. The Cek1 and Mkc1 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) pathways and their upstream Rho-type small GTPases are important for regulating cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. In the cho1Δ/Δ mutant, both the Cek1 and Mkc1 MAPKs are constitutively activated, and they act downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, respectively. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases unmasking and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc1. Moreover, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 in wild-type cells leads to Cek1 activation and increased β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure. The results suggest that upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway causes unmasking, and may be responsible for unmasking in cho1Δ/Δ.
A genome-wide association study was conducted using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The study defined clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assessed core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluated commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD, with variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) showing a strong association. Additionally, genetic loci such as GALNT7, ABCG1, and KCNMB2 were associated with specific neuropathologic features. The study confirmed 12 of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia, including CR1, BIN1, CLU, and SORL1, which showed larger odds ratios in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between effect sizes for risk of AD dementia and NFTs or NPs, and a moderate negative correlation with VBI. The study discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.
Despite decades of using urea as a denaturant in protein folding/unfolding studies, its kinetic role in the unfolding process has remained undefined. To address this, a set of 30 proteins representing all native folds were analyzed through extensive molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of urea. The results show that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. The presence of urea does not alter the spontaneous vibration pattern of proteins, but rather reduces the magnitude of such vibrations, leading to a slow down of atomic motions that opposes unfolding. Urea's stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding, as long residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. The simulations indicate that urea actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble away from the native state. The study provides a robust and complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins and the molecular mechanisms by which it contributes to accelerating protein unfolding. The results are valid at the proteome level, irrespective of protein fold, presence or absence of disulphide bridges, and secondary structure composition.
The epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2011 was characterized by a stable annual number of dengue fever cases, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue disease cases recorded during the review period were among those under 15 years of age. Nationwide surveillance data revealed a 90% increase in the number of municipalities reporting dengue disease cases between 2000 and 2010, from 424 to 743. The incidence of dengue disease was generally low in south and south-east Colombia, attributed to the region's low population density. Dengue disease is a serious public health priority in Colombia, and control of the disease has been challenging. Between 2000 and 2010, there was a general increase in the annual number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, followed by a significant decrease in 2011. Gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia were identified, including the need for studies on asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved understanding of the factors that determine disease expression and enable improvement in disease control and management is essential.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites that affects the skin and/or mucosal tissues. Coinfections with other pathogens are common in TL patients, which can influence the clinical outcome of the disease. This review aims to summarize the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and the implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. A total of 73 records were included in the review, consisting of 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies in human subjects. The review found that coinfections with Trypanosoma cruzi and helminths are common in TL patients, with frequencies ranging from 15% to 88% in Brazil and 41% in Argentina. However, the mechanisms of interaction between Leishmania and other pathogens are not well understood. Coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and may affect the effectiveness and safety of antileishmanial treatment. The review highlights the need for further research to understand how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL and to develop effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.
The study investigated the impact of natural genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. Using two genetic models, the NIH-Heterogenous Stock (HS) rats and a panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, the researchers mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio. Ten QTLs were identified across the genome, with QTLs for individual traits colocalizing within a region spanning the MHC. The QTLs were refined to two adjacent intervals of approximately 0.25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions. An interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression, as well as negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes. The effect was mapped to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (s) (RT1-A) in the MHC-I region. A recombination between RT1-A and Tap2, which occurred in 0.2% of the rats, revealed an interaction between these genes. Variants of Tap2 have previously been shown to influence the antigenicity of MHC class I molecules by altering the MHC class I ligandome. The study found that a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells. This is the first study to show how a recombination between natural alleles of genes in the MHC influences lineage commitment of T cells.
The study analyzed hospital discharge records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to characterize the evolution of Chagas disease in the country. Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America, and Spain is the European country with the highest expected number of infected patients due to its large migrant population from Latin America. The study found that hospitalization rates for Chagas disease increased from 18 to 242.8 per 100,000 population between 1997-2004 and 2005-2011, respectively. The majority of hospitalizations (75.3%) were related to Chagas disease without organ complications, while 23.4% had organ complications, with heart complications being the most common (81.7%). The study identified several factors associated with hospitalizations with organ affectation, including being male, aged 45-64 years, and having a hospitalization cost above the median (3,065 euros). The study also found that the number of detected infections increased in Spain since 2005, with the predominant patient profile being asymptomatic women of fertile age. The results highlight the need for increased efforts towards early detection of T. cruzi infections to prevent organ complications. The study suggests that a systematic approach towards disease detection and control is necessary to address the growing burden of Chagas disease in Spain.
A novel systems-level approach called BlocBuster has been developed to efficiently construct genome-wide, allele-specific networks that accurately segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and test their associations with a given phenotype. The method employs a correlation measure customized for single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and returns a multi-faceted collection of values that captures genetic heterogeneity. BlocBuster was applied to analyze psoriasis, a complex disease with hundreds of associated genetic markers, and discovered a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3. 64 and Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5. 01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, demonstrating the robustness of the method. The BlocBuster network identified a bloc of 17 SNP alleles within the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) region that is significantly associated with psoriasis, improving upon previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern. The odds ratio for the entire bloc was 3. 45, whereas the highest odds ratio for any single SNP in the region was 2. 41. This study demonstrates BlocBuster's potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, thereby transcending the limiting "small effects" produced by individual markers examined in isolation. The approach has the potential to improve the prediction of disease susceptibility and broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis underlying psoriasis.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG) are severe congenital brain malformations with largely undiscovered causes. A large-scale chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) discovery effort was conducted in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, and 2,349 controls. The study found that significantly more ACC patients had rare genic CNVs over one megabase compared to controls (p = 1.48×10−3; odds ratio [OR] = 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.89–5.39). Rare genic CNVs were defined as those impacting at least one gene in less than 1% of the combined population of patients and controls. ACC patients also had a higher burden of rare CNVs impacting over 20 genes compared to controls (p = 0.01; OR = 2.95; 95% CI = 1.69–5.18). Independent qPCR confirmation showed that 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped de novo CNVs previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (p = 3.06×10−4; OR = 7.55; 95% CI = 2.40–23.72). The study also confirmed and refined previously known CNVs, including the 8p23.1-p11.1 duplication present in 2% of the ACC cohort. Six novel CNVs were identified, each in a single patient, that are likely deleterious. One ACC patient with microcephaly had a paternally inherited deletion of 16p13.11 that included NDE1, and exome sequencing revealed a recessive maternally inherited nonsense mutation in the non-deleted allele of NDE1. This is the first systematic study of CNVs in congenital brain malformations, showing a much higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs in ACC than in CBLH and PMG.
Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling cascade, plays a crucial role in regulating the injury response in planarians. In a study using Schmidtea mediterranea, a freshwater planarian species with high regenerative capacity, researchers investigated the function of Yorkie in planarian regeneration. The results show that Yorkie ( RNAi ) animals exhibit hyper-activated and prolonged wound responses, characterized by increased stem cell proliferation and transcriptional wound response. Despite increased proliferation, stem cells in Yorkie ( RNAi ) animals do not exhibit a block in differentiation, and instead produce increased numbers of epidermal and muscle cells. The study suggests that Yorkie functions as a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning. Yorkie ( RNAi ) animals also display de-repression of the wound program, leading to increased stem cell response through extrinsic signals. Furthermore, the study identifies novel wound-induced genes that are de-repressed in Yorkie ( RNAi ) animals compared to controls. The results indicate that Yorkie is essential for regulating the size and scale of the regenerating fragment, as Yorkie ( RNAi ) animals fail to remodel or scale correctly. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of Yorkie in planarian regeneration and highlights its importance in regulating the injury response.
Exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells contain viral genomic RNA and miR-146a, a cellular microRNA that suppresses type I interferon response. The study found that EV71 infection upregulates exosome secretion and results in differential packaging of the viral genomic RNA and miR-146a. Exosomal miR-146a is preferentially co-packaged with EV71 genomic RNA and can be transferred to and suppress type I interferon expression in the recipient cell, facilitating viral replication. The exosomal viral RNA can replicate in a new target cell while the exosomal miR-146a suppresses type I interferon response. The study also found that the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs), BST-2/tetherin, are involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA exhibits differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles. The findings suggest that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA replication in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response. The study provides evidence that exosomes play a role in the transmission and replication of EV71 by modulating the host immune response.
The study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin, two genes associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a predicted mitochondrial target sequence and a probable transmembrane domain, while Parkin is a RING-finger protein with ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity. To explore their interaction, the researchers biochemically purified PINK1-binding proteins from human cultured cells and screened the genes encoding these binding proteins using Drosophila PINK1 (dPINK1) models. The study identified a PINK1-binding mitochondrial protein, PGAM5, which modulates the PINK1 pathway. Loss of Drosophila PGAM5 (dPGAM5) suppressed the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by dPINK1 inactivation, which is attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, dPGAM5 inactivation failed to modulate the phenotypes of parkin mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of dPGAM5 exacerbated the dPINK1 and Drosophila parkin (dParkin) phenotypes. These results suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to maintenance of the mitochondria and that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin or functions independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin and suggests that PGAM5 may be a potential therapeutic target for PINK1-associated PD.
Interferon-γ (IFNγ) plays a crucial role in the early host immune defense against Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) infection in mice. M. ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic necrotizing human skin disease associated with the production of the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. In an experimental BU mouse model, IFNγ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, characterized by faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This suggests that mice lacking IFNγ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. The results indicate that IFNγ-dependent activation of the bactericidal activity of macrophages helps to contain the infection during its largely intracellular early stages. The study supports the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU. The findings are consistent with previous reports on spontaneous healing of BU and a partial protective effect of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination in humans and experimentally infected mice, suggesting that clearance of the M. ulcerans infection by the immune system is possible, particularly before large clusters of mycolactone-producing extracellular bacteria have formed.
Mitochondrial respiration plays a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in various systemic diseases. However, the mechanism of ROS generation under hypoxic conditions is not fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, a new methodology for modeling mitochondrial electron transport was developed, allowing for the automated construction of large sets of differential equations. This approach facilitated the identification of two steady-state modes of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same microenvironmental conditions. Specifically, under normal conditions, complex III operates in a low ROS-producing mode, but temporal anoxia can switch it to a high ROS-producing state, which persists even after oxygen supply is restored. This bistability explains the mechanism of anoxia-induced cell damage. Experimental validation confirmed the existence of two different ROS-producing steady states in isolated mitochondria, with significantly higher ROS levels released upon reoxygenation after anoxia. The proposed method of differential equation construction enables the detailed mathematical analysis of complex bioenergetic systems, including the electron transport chain and central metabolism. This approach has the potential to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress and may be widely applied in systems biology studies. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of ROS generation under hypoxic conditions and highlight the importance of bistability in mitochondrial respiration.
The study investigates the regulatory effect of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) on gap gene expression in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. An integrative systems-level approach was used to analyze the quantitative expression data of Hkb protein, enabling its inclusion in gap gene circuit models. Gap gene circuits are mathematical models that extract regulatory information from spatial expression data by fitting the model to gap gene expression patterns. The study shows that considering variability in the data combined with analysis of parameter determinability significantly improves the biological relevance and consistency of the approach. The models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two important respects. Firstly, Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, specifically required for the anterior shift in its posterior border. Secondly, gap gene circuits presented here are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, whereas previously published models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly. As a result, the models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.
A novel immunotherapy for Brucellosis in cows has been developed using phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51. Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease causing significant economic losses worldwide, with no effective immunotherapy or biomarker for monitoring treatment efficacy currently available. The phage lysates, which retain maximum immunogenicity, were used to immunize 21 naturally Brucellosis-affected adult cows. The results showed that a single subcutaneous dose of 2 ml of the phage lysate cocktail eliminated live virulent Brucella from infected cattle within 3 months. The plasma level of Brucella-specific 223 bp amplicon was undetectable by RT-PCR, and the blood was negative for live Brucella by culture. The phage lysate of RB51 (RL) stimulated cell-mediated immunity (CMI), while the phage lysate of S19 (SL) induced a strong antibody response. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from RL-immunized cattle induced interferon-gamma production. The ELISPOT assay detected interferon-γ-producing lymphocytes in peripheral blood lymphocytes from Brucellosis-affected cattle treated with lysates of vaccine strains of Brucella. This is the first report on the use of RB51 phage lysate for successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle and the minimally invasive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy employing plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker.
The study investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in the DNA damage response in human cells. Using a mutant version of Cdk2 that is sensitive to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs, the researchers found that transient inhibition of Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhances cell-killing. This suggests that Cdk2 activity is required for an effective DNA damage response. The study also identified Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, as a substrate of Cdk2. Phosphorylation of Nbs1 at Ser432 by Cdk2 is necessary for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. Inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. These findings indicate that Cdk2 plays a non-redundant role in the DNA damage response and that Nbs1 is a specific target of Cdk2. The study used chemical genetics to uncover the requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and to identify a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery. The results suggest that Cdk2 is needed to phosphorylate proteins de novo in response to DNA lesions, and that its activity is necessary for an effective DNA damage response.
The study aimed to identify functional variants associated with hematological traits by mapping open chromatin regions in megakaryocytic and erythroblastoid cell lines using the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method. The researchers analyzed 62 genetic loci associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. They found that the two cell types exhibited distinct patterns of open chromatin, suggesting that cell-specific open chromatin can guide the identification of functional variants.

The study identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors the common non-coding sequence variant rs342293 associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing of this region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region. The researchers demonstrated that the C- and G-alleles of rs342293 differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting PIK3CG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network indicated that PIK3CG is associated with gene pathways involved in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation.

The study suggests that rs342293 is the functional common variant at this locus, providing a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding genome-wide association study (GWA) index SNP modulates platelet phenotype. The researchers also identified six putative functional variants associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits that fall into open chromatin regions. These findings highlight the importance of cell-specific open chromatin in identifying functional variants and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hematological and cardiovascular traits.
The effects of persistent sodium current (INaP) blockade in respiratory circuits depend on the pharmacological mechanism of action and network dynamics. Computer simulations were used to investigate the blockade of INaP in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) via two distinct mechanisms: pore obstruction by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and altered inactivation dynamics by riluzole (RZ). TTX directly blocks the Na+ pore, whereas RZ shifts INaP inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. In vitro blocking studies using TTX or RZ have suggested that INaP is critical for intrinsic bursting in pacemaker neurons and network rhythm generation in the isolated pre-BötC. However, simulations showed that RZ blockade of INaP fails to stop the rhythm, indicating that RZ may not effectively block INaP in the intact network. In contrast, simulations predict that complete blockade of INaP by TTX will stop the respiratory rhythm. The results also suggest that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP, and that experimental TTX application in the intact network is predicted to terminate respiratory rhythmicity. These findings support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and highlight the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results and generates experimentally testable predictions.
The study investigated the role of microRNA-218 (miR-218) in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. It was found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC, along with its host gene Slit3. However, miR-218 negatively regulates Robo1, a Slit receptor, establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, activating the Slit-Robo1 pathway, which triggers tumor metastasis. The restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit is disrupted in GC metastasis, suggesting that targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis. Upregulation of Robo1 in response to decreased miR-218 induces a reactive upregulation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway, facilitating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Robo1 is over-expressed in cancer cells and promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis via interaction with Slit. The inverse relationship between miR-218 and Robo1 expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in gastric cancer tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues. Robo1 was found to be a critical downstream target of miR-218, and its induction by a Robo1 mutant construct reversed miR-218-mediated suppression of tumor cell invasion. Knockdown of Robo1 gene expression reduced tumor cell invasion, similar to the restoration of miR-218. The study provides new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC and reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling.
The study investigated the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development and identified a network of cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis target genes. Atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins (Ldlr−/−Apo100/100 Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre) were used for transcriptional profiling at 10-week intervals. The results showed that atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then expanded rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion expression profiles indicated that accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation. Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol at this point prevented the formation of advanced plaques. Transcriptional profiling of the atherosclerotic arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. The network of cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis target genes and regulators of foam-cell formation identified in this study merits further attention for the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development and identifies potential therapeutic targets for preventing the formation of advanced plaques.
A genome-wide screen for bacterial envelope biogenesis mutants in Escherichia coli has identified a novel factor, ElyC (YcbC), involved in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. The screen, which used a quantitative and high-throughput assay, correctly identified numerous mutants known to be involved in envelope assembly and implicated 102 genes of unknown function as encoding factors that likely impact envelope biogenesis. Further analysis of ElyC and other hits from the screen is expected to provide new insights into the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and the vulnerabilities in the system suitable for drug targeting. The screening assay is also adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures. The discovery of ElyC as a new envelope biogenesis factor validates the utility of the screening approach and highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory strategies used to coordinate the construction of the different envelope layers. Further study of these factors is likely to reveal new mechanisms underlying the envelope assembly process, which could serve as drug targets to block cell growth or render the envelope permeable to approved drugs currently ineffective against Gram-negative organisms. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of new therapies to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections, which are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the rise of new resistance mechanisms.
The article presents a semi-supervised learning framework for fusing heterogeneous datasets from imaging studies of developing tissues into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics. The approach exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets to synthesize developmental trajectories. The method was applied to a dataset of ∼ 1000 images of Drosophila embryos, each revealing the spatial position of nuclei and one or several components of the dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning network. Pairwise similarities between images were computed using the common channel, and a closed-form expression for the estimated values of all variables was obtained using harmonic extension. The reconstructed trajectories provide a continuous view of the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. The result is a multivariable trajectory for the joint dynamics of tissue shape and five molecular components within the regulatory network that patterns the DV axis of the embryo. This approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics. The method addresses the challenge of synthesizing data from different observations into coherent multivariable trajectories, which is a common task in various fields, including physics and social sciences. The reconstructed trajectories provide a basis for more advanced mechanistic studies of multivariable processes responsible for the highly reproducible dynamics of developmental pattern formation.
The study investigated the tissue localization and extracellular matrix degradation by snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of the PI, PII, and PIII classes. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP, which showed a more widespread distribution in the tissue. The patterns of hydrolysis by these three SVMPs of laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen in vivo differed, whereas the three enzymes showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen. This suggests that hydrolysis of type IV collagen is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs. Higher extent of proteolysis was observed for the PI enzyme regarding several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, whereas exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of some intracellular proteins. The study provides novel clues for understanding the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage. The results support the hypothesis that the high hemorrhagic activity of PII and PIII SVMPs is at least partially due to the selective localization of these enzymes in the basement membrane of microvessels.
The homeotic gene abd-A in Drosophila melanogaster is subject to regulation by the noncoding RNA iab-8. The iab-8 RNA produces a microRNA that represses abd-A, but it also has a second, redundant repression mechanism that acts only in cis. This cis-repression is achieved through transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter. The iab-8 RNA interferes with an abd-A enhancer that lies downstream of the iab-4186 breakpoint, and the major poly(A) site of the iab-8 RNA is located 1.1 kb upstream of the abd-A initiation site. The primary transcript of the iab-8 RNA likely continues past its poly(A) addition site. In embryos lacking Abd-B, ectopic expression of abd-A is observed in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. The iab-8 RNA is responsible for repressing abd-A in neuronal cells. Rearrangement breaks that truncate the iab-8 RNA near its start site cause a dramatic derepression of abd-A in the CNS of the 8th abdominal segment. The iab-8 ncRNA is a 90 kb-long transcription unit that extends between Abd-B and abd-A, with a likely start site within the iab-8 regulatory region. RNA in-situ hybridizations detect an RNA in the 8th and 9th abdominal segments (parasegments 13 & 14). The iab-8 RNA represses abd-A through two mechanisms: production of the iab-8 miRNA (acting in trans) and a repressive function acting only in cis, which is achieved through transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter.
A computational model of neocortical tissue was used to investigate the mechanisms underlying different onset patterns of focal seizures. The model was validated using clinical recordings of focal seizures and was able to reproduce two distinct patterns: low amplitude fast ( LAF ) oscillations and high amplitude spikes ( HAS ). The results showed that LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localized activity that slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of the surrounding tissue, which does not generate seizures on its own but can support seizure activity when incited. The difference in surrounding tissue excitability was found to explain the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. The model also demonstrated that changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation. The findings suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcome. The model was able to reproduce the initial onset and evolution of the seizure, including the growing amplitude in the LAF pattern and the development of high-amplitude spiking activity. However, the model did not simulate the termination of the seizure.
In flowering plants, sperm cells are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube, a structure formed by the male gametophyte. Upon arrival at the female gametophyte, two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. Recent studies have identified the first players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and arrest their growth. However, the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and sperm discharge have remained elusive. This study describes the role of polymorphic defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 from maize in pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and explosive sperm release. ZmES4 is exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells. Upon pollen tube arrival, ZmES4 is released and interacts with the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1, leading to channel opening and K+ influx. The influx of K+ results in water uptake and culminates in osmotic tube burst. The species-preferential activity of ZmES4 indicates that this mechanism represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants. Using RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins, the study demonstrates that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner and identifies KZM1 as a direct target of ZmES4.
A novel oncolytic herpesvirus, R-LM249, has been engineered to selectively target and kill cancer cells expressing high levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) oncoprotein. HER-2 is overexpressed in certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. In a preclinical study, R-LM249 was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mice with disseminated HER-2+ ovarian and breast carcinomas. The results showed that R-LM249 effectively inhibited the growth of tumors in the peritoneal cavity, with 60% of mice remaining free from peritoneal diffusion and a 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. Additionally, R-LM249 strongly inhibited the growth of ovarian metastases of HER-2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cells and reduced brain metastases. Notably, R-LM249 was effective against HER-2+ cells that were resistant to the growth inhibition by trastuzumab, a commonly used HER-2-targeted therapy. The study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of R-LM249 in treating disseminated HER-2+ ovarian and breast carcinomas, particularly in the peritoneal cavity. The results suggest that R-LM249 could be a promising treatment option for patients with HER-2+ ovarian and breast cancers that have spread to the peritoneal cavity.
In eukaryotic cells, centrosomes serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle, and their duplication once per cell cycle is essential for bipolar spindle organization and proper chromosome segregation. A study has identified Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdk ) substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. The research found that reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 by changing its phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies ( SPBs, yeast centrosomes ) and inappropriate SPB reduplication during mitosis. This results in defects in bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. The study proposes that phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 has a dual function : promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. The protein phosphatase Cdc14 has the converse role of activating licensing, likely via dephosphorylation of Sfi1. After SPB duplication is complete, Cdk1 phosphorylates at least four Sfi1 C-terminal residues, allowing for SPB separation and bipolar spindle formation during mitosis. These residues remain phosphorylated during mitosis, restricting licensing of SPB duplication until downregulation of mitotic cyclin/Cdk1 at the end of mitosis. Dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdc14 at the end of mitosis licenses the SPBs for the next cycle of G1 SPB duplication.
This study investigated the role of viral protein R ( Vpr ) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Using a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model, the researchers demonstrated that Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, which mainly consist of regulatory CD4+ T cells ( Tregs ). This results in Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. The Vpr-dependent enhancement of virus replication and Treg depletion was observed in CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting that these effects are dependent on the coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation was observed in CCR5-tropic wild-type but not in vpr-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice. The study found that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells for enhancing viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, making them more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection. The results suggest that Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells including Tregs. The study provides direct evidence for the first time that Vpr positively affects HIV-1 replication by taking advantage of Tregs in vivo.
A 15-year longitudinal study on Plasmodium vivax population genetics in South Korea was conducted using microsatellite DNA markers to assess the population structure and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission. The study analyzed 14 microsatellite DNA loci from 163 isolates collected between 1994 and 2008. The results showed a gradual decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels and an increase in genetic diversity from 1994 to 2008. However, a drastic genetic change was observed in the South Korean P. vivax population during 2002 and 2003. This change was not attributed to relapse or asymptomatic parasite carriage, but rather to the continual introduction of P. vivax into South Korea from other parasite population sources. One possible source of this introduction is North Korea, particularly during 2002 and 2003. The study suggests that molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA of the P. vivax population is effective for assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission, which can aid in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
The study investigated the role of a splicing-competent intron in regulating transcription directionality in eukaryotes. It was found that the intron is an important regulator of promoter directionality, favoring the transcription of mRNA over upstream anti-sense transcripts (uaRNA) initiating from the promoter. Mutation of either the 5' or 3' splice site resulted in the reversal of promoter directionality, suggesting that the entire splicing-competent intron, not just the 5' splice site, regulates transcription directionality. ChIP analysis revealed the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region in the presence of an intron, which was affected by the removal of the intron or mutation of splice sites. The study also demonstrated that gene looping is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, the promoter occupancy of factors required for poly(A)-dependent termination of transcription was compromised, accompanied by a concomitant loss of transcription directionality. The results suggest that the intron-dependent gene looping places terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region for termination of promoter-initiated upstream antisense transcription, thereby conferring promoter directionality. The study provides evidence that the transcription directionality of a subset of genes in yeast is dependent on the presence of a splicing-competent intron, which facilitates the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region.
ZBED6 is a novel transcription factor derived from a domesticated DNA transposon that regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2 in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle, resulting in major effects on muscle growth, size of the heart, and fat deposition. The repressor of IGF2 expression was identified as ZBED6, which is specific to placental mammals and is derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affects Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using C2C12 cells identified approximately 2, 500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif that matches the established binding site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites are enriched for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth. ZBED6 binds to its target sites in IGF2, leading to repression of IGF2 expression in pig skeletal muscle and mouse C2C12 cells. Silencing of Zbed6 also leads to increased cell proliferation, faster myotube formation, and faster wound healing in C2C12 cells. The ability of ZBED6 to interact with chromatin and affect transcriptional regulation is likely derived from its ancestral transposase function.
The RNA editome in rhesus macaques has been comprehensively profiled using genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal. The study identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions. The findings suggest that adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, with A-to-G editing sites flanked by sequences with attributes of ADAR substrates. The sequence context and expression profile of ADARs were found to be relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types. The study also detected substitution valleys of decreased divergence around editing sites, indicating evolutionary constraint in maintaining some editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. These results support the "continuous probing" model of RNA editing, which proposes that a small proportion of functional editing sites originate through tinkering. The macaque editome provides an informative framework for understanding RNA editing in humans and highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution. The study also found intra-population conservation of the macaque editome and parallels of the editome across multiple primate species, suggesting that purifying selection may have shaped the RNA editome. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive and quantitative profile of the RNA editome in rhesus macaques, shedding light on the mechanisms and functional relevance of RNA editing in primates.
A new perceptual bias has been identified in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks, where observers read out the likelihood representation with low precision when discriminating grating spatial frequencies. In a two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination task, filtered visual noise significantly alters the perception of two known gratings, shifting perceived spatial frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high-pass filtered noise conditions, respectively. Observers consider the log likelihood values of spatial frequencies that are a-priori unlikely to occur during the task, which lowers grating detectability and leads to a bias in perceived spatial frequency. The log likelihood functions are asymmetrical around the veridical grating frequency in the presence of low-pass and high-pass filtered noise. High overall performance and steep psychometric functions in the discrimination task indicate that observers base their decisions at least partially on the veridical grating spatial frequency. Grating detectability and discriminability were measured in the presence of filtered visual noise, revealing that filtered noise backgrounds dramatically alter the perception of grating spatial frequency. Embedding a grating in low-pass filtered noise causes the perceived spatial frequency of the grating to decrease, while high-pass filtered noise increases perceived grating spatial frequency. These findings suggest that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives when performing two-alternative discrimination.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. Recent studies have shown that piRNAs are derived from the processing of a long, polycistronic RNA precursor. However, this study reveals that each C. elegans piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. The minimal C. elegans piRNA cassette requires only a 21 nucleotide ( nt ) piRNA sequence and an ∼50 nt upstream motif with limited genomic context for expression. This upstream motif is necessary for independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. The study demonstrates that a single nucleotide position within this motif directs differential germline enrichment. Over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and comparison of the genes they target suggests that these two populations have evolved independently. The results indicate that C. elegans piRNA upstream motifs act as independent promoters to specify which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in what germline. The study reveals that the number of transcriptional units encoding piRNAs rivals the number of mRNA coding genes in the C. elegans genome. The findings suggest that each 21U RNA locus encodes all the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15, 000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans.
During Brucella infection, the bacteria replicate within host cells in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER )-derived vacuoles. The mechanisms by which Brucella acquires the ER-derived membrane for replication are not fully understood. This study investigated the role of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in Brucella intracellular life and identified a novel host factor, Yip1A, essential for the activation of the IRE1 pathway. The IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, of the UPR was activated in a time-dependent manner during Brucella infection, and the COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D were upregulated. The biogenesis of ER-derived vacuoles was observed in the close proximity of replicating bacteria in Brucella-infected cells. Yip1A was found to be responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites ( ERES ) under UPR conditions. In Yip1A-knockdown cells, Brucella failed to generate ER-derived vacuoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The autophagy-related proteins Atg9 and WIPI1, but not DFCP1, were required for the biogenesis of ER-derived membrane compartments. These findings indicate that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuoles are critical for Brucella to establish a safe replication niche, and that Yip1A is indispensable for these processes. The study proposes a model for intracellular Brucella replication that exploits the host UPR and ER-derived vacuole formation machineries, both of which depend on Yip1A-mediated IRE1 activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large viral replication compartment. The kinase function of Vps34 is crucial for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P phosphoinositide is utilized by TBSV for building the replication compartment. Overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TBSV replication on peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on mitochondrial membranes. The purified PI(3)P phosphatase also reduced TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3)P with antibody or a bioprobe revealed the enrichment of PI(3)P in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in surrogate yeast host unraveled that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit the Rab5-positive early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. Vps34 and PI(3)P are needed for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance was decreased by an inhibitor of Vps34.
A study was conducted in Iquitos, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on dengue virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood feeding methods based on rates of dengue virus (DENV) infection and dissemination within mosquitoes. Between 2011 and 2015, 58 participants, aged 5 years and older, with 5 or fewer days of fever, were enrolled from ongoing clinic- and neighborhood-based studies on dengue in Iquitos. Wild-type, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. The results showed that DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding, but were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. No differences were detected in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability. The study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild or inapparent disease to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes.
Biomedical researchers investigated the genetic basis of variability in response to topoisomerase II poisons in Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism. They found that natural variation in the topoisomerase II enzyme, specifically a methionine-to-glutamine substitution at position 797 ( Q797M ), underlies differences in sensitivity to etoposide and other topoisomerase II poisons. The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions with the poison etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms ( hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ ). The researchers used genome-edited human cell lines to show that the methionine residue in hTOPIIα contributes to differential toxicity of various topoisomerase II poisons, including teniposide and XK469. These results demonstrate the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses and highlight the potential for personalized treatments based on genetic information. The findings also explain why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons, providing insights into the mechanisms of drug susceptibility in human cells.
The study investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying lifespan determination in mammals by analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species, including long-lived African mole-rats (Bathyergidae) and short-lived rats. The researchers identified 250 positively selected genes (PSGs) associated with enhanced longevity, which showed an expression pattern consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. This theory proposes that genes with beneficial effects in youth have detrimental effects in old age. The PSGs were found to be enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, the PSGs included RHEB and IGF1, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes previously unknown to be associated with aging, such as RHEBL1, AMHR2, PSMG1, and AGER. Protein homology modeling suggested functional consequences for amino acid changes under positive selection. The study's findings provide a resource for further investigation into the mechanisms linking identified genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan determination. The results are consistent with previous studies in other organisms, including worms, killifishes, and mice, which have shown that lower expression of genes related to these processes is associated with longer lifespan.
Researchers have developed a new Aedes albopictus transinfection, ARwP-M, by introducing the wMel Wolbachia strain into the ARwP line, which had previously been established by replacing the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia strains with the wPip strain. The new transinfection showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia. The study compared the infection and fitness parameters of ARwP-M, ARwP, and wild-type Aedes albopictus sharing the same genetic background. The results showed that survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility did not differ between the three Aedes albopictus lines. However, crosses between ARwP-M males and wild-type females were fully unfertile, while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased from 0 to about 17% with wild-type males aging from 3 to 17 days. When competing with wild-type males for wild-type females, ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15-fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection. This feature corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses, with transmission rates of 5% and 0% at 14 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. The vector competence for Zika virus did not show significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP, but none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable of transmitting Zika virus. These findings suggest that the exploitation of Wolbachia could be used to suppress wild-type Aedes albopictus populations.
The study presents a novel approach to identifying peptide-mediated interactions in proteins using high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures. Current methods for discovering peptide motifs rely on their tendency to occur in disordered regions, but this work focuses on the observation that peptides adopt a well-defined structure upon binding to their partner domain. By analyzing 3D structures of known peptide-mediated interactions, the researchers found that the structure of the peptide can be as characteristic as the consensus motif, enabling the identification of target peptides even if they do not match established patterns. The study reveals that peptides involved in these interactions tend to have a stretched and elongated structure, unlike most other peptides of the same length. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was implemented to search the set of protein interactions of known 3D structure and identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions. The analysis also derived consensus patterns for these interactions and compared them with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. The results were cross-validated by scanning interactome networks from four model organisms, revealing significant over-representations for 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which had not been described before. The study provides a new strategy for identifying peptide-mediated interactions and highlights the importance of structural data in understanding protein recognition and specificity.
This study investigated the cellular mechanisms of impaired barrier function in environmental enteropathy (EE), a condition associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines. Using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies from 49 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia, the researchers found virtually ubiquitous small intestinal damage. Epithelial defects were predominantly seen at the tips of villi and corresponded with leakage imaged in vivo by CLE. Circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was correlated with cell shedding events and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Zinc uptake from a test dose was attenuated in 64% of individuals and was reduced by HIV, but positively correlated with GLP-2. Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Confocal endomicroscopy, claudin 4 immunostaining, and histology identified epithelial defects, which are probably sites of bacterial translocation. The study suggests that increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation, and GLP-2 and other protective peptides may play an important role in mucosal protection in EE. Biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation were compared with confocal images and zinc uptake to explore barrier defects and identify potential biomarkers for further research.
The study investigated the molecular mechanism of superinfection exclusion (SIE) in turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a phenomenon where host cells block re-infection by the same or highly similar viruses. The research found that SIE in TCV is exclusively determined by p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by the virus. p28 expressed from a TCV replicon exerted strong SIE to a different TCV replicon, and transiently expressed p28 delivered simultaneously with or ahead of a TCV replicon largely recapitulated this repressive activity. The study demonstrated that p28-mediated SIE is enhanced by C-terminal modifications and inversely correlates with the ability of p28 to complement the replication of a p28-defective TCV replicon. Furthermore, p28 in SIE-positive cells formed large, mobile punctate inclusions that trans-aggregated a non-coalescing, SIE-defective, yet replication-competent p28 mutant. The results support a model postulating that TCV SIE is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes capable of intercepting fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes, thereby abolishing superinfector replication. This model could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer novel targets for antiviral therapy. The study reveals that p28 acts both as a replication facilitator and a repressor, depending on its cellular concentration, and provides insights into the molecular mechanism of SIE in TCV.
Vaccination with a plasmid DNA encoding the Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) gene has been shown to induce strong immune responses and provide protection against acute lethal challenge in mice. However, long-term protection has not been reported. To investigate whether the co-administration of a plasmid encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) could improve the duration of protection, mice were immunized with pTS in the presence or absence of pIL-15. The results showed that mice receiving pTS alone developed robust TS-specific IFN-γ responses and survived a lethal challenge given within the first 3 months following immunization. The addition of pIL-15 to pTS vaccination did not significantly alter T cell responses or protection during this early post-vaccination period. However, mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 challenged 6 months post-vaccination were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges than mice vaccinated with pTS alone. Improved protection correlated with significantly higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells detected >6 months post-immunization. The addition of pIL-15 during genetic vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi. These findings suggest that co-administration of pIL-15 with pTS can enhance long-term protection against T. cruzi, a complex intracellular protozoan pathogen.
In Trypanosoma brucei, a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1, and the WD40-repeat protein WDR1 controls the abundance of the Polo-like kinase homolog TbPLK. TbPLK plays essential roles in basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. WDR1 interacts with TbPLK through its C-terminal domain and with TbDDB1 through its N-terminal WD40 motif. Depletion of WDR1 inhibits bilobe duplication and basal body segregation, disrupts the assembly of the new flagellum attachment zone filament, and detaches the new flagellum. This is due to excessive accumulation of TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe, leading to continuous phosphorylation of TbCentrin2 in the bilobe at late cell cycle stages. The results identify WDR1 as a TbPLK receptor in the Cullin4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex for degrading TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe after the G1/S cell cycle transition. This process promotes bilobe duplication, basal body separation, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. The CRL4WDR1 complex is responsible for degrading TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe, and its depletion leads to defective bilobe duplication, flagellum attachment, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. WDR1 localizes to the basal body and the bilobe region during G1 and S phases, suggesting that CRL4WDR1 is primarily responsible for TbPLK degradation in these regions.
The DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3X plays a crucial role in the innate immune system, particularly in the context of antimicrobial immunity. Mice lacking DDX3X in the hematopoietic system exhibit altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen and are highly susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes infection. This suggests that DDX3X is essential for the innate immune response against Listeria. The sex-specific isoforms of DDX3, DDX3X and DDX3Y, contribute to innate immunity, with DDX3X having a more significant impact. The loss of DDX3X affects the innate immune system through its role in hematopoiesis and its regulation of the innate response to Listeria infections. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that DDX3X deficiency alters the expression of genes involved in the innate antimicrobial response of macrophages, with the extent of the effect depending on the sex chromosomes of the cells. DDX3X has been shown to regulate IFN-I transcription in cells infected with viruses or Listeria monocytogenes. The DEAD-box RNA helicase superfamily 2, to which DDX3X belongs, has widespread functions in RNA metabolism, including transcription, RNA processing, splicing, decay, and translation. These findings provide further evidence for the importance of DDX3X in innate immunity and suggest that it may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.
A computational model of the insect pheromone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) has been developed. The model focuses on post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers (IP3 and DAG), the opening and closing of ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model takes into account the translocation of pheromone molecules from air to sensillum lymph, their deactivation and interaction with receptors, and G-protein and effector enzyme activation. The model captures the main features of the dose-response curves, including a wide dynamic range of six decades with amplitudes matching experimental data, short rising time, and long falling time. It also reproduces the second messenger kinetics. The model suggests that the two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations. The DAG-gated cationic channel plays a major role in depolarization at low concentrations, while the Ca2+-gated Cl− channel plays a major role at middle and high concentrations. The model was fitted to experimental data by adjusting unknown parameter values. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of pheromone transduction in insects and suggest several testable predictions for future research. The model builds on previous studies of olfactory transduction in vertebrates and takes into account recent findings on insect ORs, G-proteins, and effectors.
The study investigated the interactions between chromatin context, binding site sequence content, and sequence evolution in stress-induced p53 occupancy and transactivation. Genome-wide binding localizations of p53 and H3K4me3 were mapped in untreated and doxorubicin-treated human lymphoblastoid cells to examine the relationships among p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3K4me3, chromatin accessibility, ENCODE chromatin states, p53RE sequence, and evolutionary conservation. The results showed that the inducible expression of p53-regulated genes was associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or displayed CTCF binding. Weaker p53REs resided in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located within enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE. Occupancy by p53 of REs that overlapped transposable element (TE) repeats was significantly higher and correlated with stronger p53RE sequences relative to non-TE-associated p53REs. However, binding at these elements was generally not associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. The study highlights the systematic interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context in the induced transactivation response, which appears to have been tuned via evolutionary processes that may have led to repression and/or utilization of p53REs originating from primate-specific transposon elements.
Biomedical researchers have reengineered a specific motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems to create a tunable threshold device. The motif consists of a single histidine kinase ( HK ) that reversibly phosphorylates two separate output response regulator ( RR ) proteins. This system allows for rapid signal termination and implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship, where the steady-state levels of the phosphorylated output RR remain low until a threshold level of signal is crossed. Two mathematical conditions on system parameters are necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships, and key parameters control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. The researchers experimentally confirmed these findings by reconstituting the one HK-two RR motif in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. The level of sigmoidality in this system can be controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK, yielding Hill coefficients of above 7. This reengineered system provides an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. The findings have implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits, and can be applied to any two-component signaling circuit where multiple response regulators compete for phosphorylation by a single phosphodonor.
Title: Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory heterogeneity in yeast responding to stress

    Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to investigate transcript heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress. The study aimed to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. The results showed significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells was found to decouple the expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, which was partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle.

    Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells. The study also found variable activation of the Environmental Stress Response (ESR) and condition-specific regulators after stress, as well as heterogeneity in ESR activation in unstressed cells due to both coordinated and discordant induction of ESR regulators.

    The results provide new insights into heterogeneity in the yeast stress response and suggest that cell-to-cell variation in Msn2 activation could explain the heterogeneity in stress tolerance in an actively growing culture. However, it remains unclear if this variation correlates with broader transcriptome changes, if the magnitude of the response in unstressed cells mimics that seen in stressed cells, or if fluctuations in the response correlate with cell-cycle phase.
Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in large numbers in the male reproductive organs of mice, including the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. Fine needle aspiration cytology and histopathological analysis revealed that the parasites are associated with marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage, including rupture of epididymal ducts. These findings suggest that the male reproductive organs are not immune-privileged sites for T. brucei, as previously thought. In fact, the parasites are exposed to a strong immune response in these organs, which may be related to reduced fertility. The epididymal adipose tissue and the stroma of the epididymis are the most parasitized areas, with a temporal increase in parasite density reaching 105 parasites per mg of organ at late stages of the disease. The detection of a high number of parasites in the male reproductive organs opens the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool for Animal African Trypanosomiasis. The study also shows that T. brucei infection is associated with disruption of the blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers at later stages of the infection. Overall, the findings suggest that the male reproductive system is an important site for accumulation of trypanosomes, but the testis itself is not a major site of parasite accumulation.
The study investigated the plasticity of the chemoreceptor repertoire in Drosophila melanogaster by examining the expression of chemoreceptor genes in response to various environmental and physiological conditions. Using customized cDNA microarrays, the researchers found that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. The expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions, and exposure to the odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes. These genes are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. The analysis of covariance in transcript abundance of chemosensory genes across all environmental conditions revealed that they segregate into 20 relatively small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome enables fine-tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions. The study provides a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemosensory window through which the fly experiences its chemical environment. The results demonstrate that the expression of chemoreceptor genes is highly sexually dimorphic and frequently sexually antagonistic, and the extent of transcriptional responses to changing conditions is heterogeneous among the chemoreceptor repertoire. This modular organization of the chemosensory transcriptome allows for finely tuned phenotypic plasticity of expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire under different environmental conditions.
The study investigated the relationship between meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human oocytes. Previous research has shown that abnormal meiotic recombination is linked to the origin of human trisomies, specifically failure to recombine or recombination events located too near to or too far from the centromere. Immunofluorescence methodology was used to directly examine the meiotic recombination process in human fetal oocytes by analyzing crossover-associated proteins such as MLH1. The study analyzed 1035 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal ovarian samples and found that the number of MLH1 foci was lower than predicted from genetic linkage analysis. However, the localization pattern of MLH1 conformed to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. The study also found evidence for the presence of “vulnerable” crossover configurations in individual chromosomes, consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. These findings suggest that direct analyses of crossover events in human fetal oocytes can reveal “vulnerable” crossover configurations that exhibit chromosome specificity consistent with data from trisomic conceptions. However, not all situations were as clear-cut, as no evidence was found for “spikes” in the proportion of extremely distal or proximal MLH1 foci on chromosome 21, despite the fact that proximal and distal exchanges are associated with maternal meiosis I and II-derived cases of trisomy 21.
The article explores the epidemiological consequences of immune sensitization by pre-exposure to vector saliva in the context of vector-borne diseases. Blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, transmit diseases that impose significant public health and economic burdens. The saliva of these arthropods contains immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding and can elicit an immune response in the host. Research suggests that pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can alter disease progression, with evidence from Leishmania, Plasmodium, and arboviral infections indicating that pre-sensitization can both exacerbate and limit infection symptoms. A general model of vector-borne disease was developed to investigate the impact of immune pre-sensitization on vector control. The results show that pre-sensitized infected hosts can increase in abundance when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates, potentially leading to greater than expected disease control if pre-sensitization leads to rapid clearance of infection. However, if pre-sensitization prolongs infection duration, vector control can increase the total number of infected hosts, which may go unnoticed unless active surveillance methods are used to detect sub-clinical individuals. Sensitivity analysis suggests that integrated vector management can mitigate these negative consequences. The study highlights the need to quantify how immune pre-sensitization modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-borne diseases, as the effect of saliva pre-exposure on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis but largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations.
This study investigated the effect of host immune responses on Leishmania amazonensis protein expression by comparing the proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. Leishmaniasis is a significant disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with Leishmania amazonensis being a major agent in Brazil. The researchers employed two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to analyze the proteomes of amastigotes from both mouse strains. The results showed 44 differentially expressed spots, including proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases, such as oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase, which are known Leishmania virulence factors. Notably, specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may restrain their post-translational modifications in BALB/c mice. In contrast, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice. This study provides new insights into the regulation of Leishmania protein expression by host T cell-dependent responses and may help identify potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression. The findings have implications for understanding the immunopathology of Leishmania infections and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification and reprogramming CpG methylation in early development. However, AID is also highly mutagenic and can cause genomic instability, leading to chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. This study reveals that AID is cell cycle-regulated, with its nuclear degradation occurring more slowly in the G1 phase than in the S or G2-M phase. Mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. By fusing AID to tags that destabilize nuclear protein outside of G1 or S-G2/M phases, the researchers demonstrate that enforced nuclear localization of AID in G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. This suggests that cell cycle regulation determines the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage. The study also identifies AID derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, which could be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins by iterative mutagenesis and selection. Furthermore, the use of cell cycle tags to regulate nuclear stability may be generally applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.
Scientists have developed a new method to analyze how microbes break down plant polysaccharides, which are complex carbohydrates found in plant biomass. This method combines three techniques: carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. The researchers applied this method to the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans to study how it ferments various plant biomass components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. The results show that the bacterium ferments these polysaccharides with varying efficiencies and prioritizes the metabolism of preferred substrates. The researchers found that the bacterium up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars in response to different polysaccharides. A total of 56 up-regulated CAZymes were purified and tested for their activities, revealing that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with different rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. The researchers also identified synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study provides new insights into how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is essential for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities and developing improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass.
In Sierra Leone, three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) were conducted between 2008 and 2010 in 12 districts co-endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis. The MDA was part of an integrated approach to manage both diseases. A midterm assessment was conducted in 2011 to evaluate the impact of the MDA on LF prevalence. The results showed a significant decrease in microfilaria (mf) prevalence from 2.6% (95% CI: 2.3-3.0%) at baseline to 0.3% (95% CI: 0.19-0.47%) after three rounds of MDA, representing an 88.5% reduction. Four districts (Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono) achieved a 100% decrease in mf prevalence, while seven districts experienced reductions ranging from 70.0% to 95.0%. Only Bombali district still had an mf prevalence of ≥1.0% (1.58%, 95% CI: 0.80-3.09%). The overall arithmetic mean mf density decreased by 65.4% among mf-positive individuals and 96.2% for the entire population examined. The results indicate that mf prevalence decreased to <1.0% in all but one of the 12 districts after three rounds of MDA. The study suggests that the integrated approach to managing onchocerciasis and LF has been effective in reducing LF prevalence in Sierra Leone.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, the analysis of compositional data generated by these techniques can produce unreliable results due to the observed data taking the form of relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, the authors show that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, leading to many artifactual correlations among taxa and potentially opposite signs of true correlations. Community diversity is identified as a key factor modulating the acuteness of these compositional effects. To address this issue, the authors develop a new approach, called SparCC, capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. SparCC is applied to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. The results show that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. The SparCC network is used as a reference to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
The study investigated the role of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications in the colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract. Lysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme present on mucosal surfaces that hydrolyzes bacterial peptidoglycan and has a cationic antimicrobial peptide activity. Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, modify the peptidoglycan of S. pneumoniae and have been implicated in its resistance to lysozyme in vitro. The study found that the muramidase activity of lysozyme is responsible for its antimicrobial effect, and that both PgdA and Adr modifications are required for full resistance to lysozyme. Competition experiments in mice showed that wild-type pneumococci outcompeted a double mutant lacking both PgdA and Adr in mice with sufficient lysozyme, but not in mice deficient in lysozyme. In contrast, strains with single mutations in either PgdA or Adr had a competitive advantage over wild-type pneumococci in both lysozyme-sufficient and -deficient mice. These findings suggest that individual peptidoglycan modifications reduce fitness during colonization, but that the combination of modifications provides a significant survival advantage when lysozyme is abundant. The study highlights the importance of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications in dictating the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the upper airway.
A new approach to diagnosing dengue fatal cases has been investigated using NS1 antigen capture tests in tissue specimens from 23 previously confirmed dengue fatal cases that occurred in Brazil in 2002. The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool for detecting dengue virus (DENV) in tissue specimens. A total of 74 tissue specimens were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. Three tests for NS1 antigen capture were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip. The results showed that the NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive, detecting DENV in 78.3% (58/74) of the specimens, followed by Platelia NS1 (45.9%, 34/74) and Dengue Early ELISA (22.9%, 17/74). The NS1 Ag Strip was particularly effective in detecting DENV in liver (91.3%, 21/23), lung (71.4%, 10/14), kidney (100%, 4/4), brain (80%, 8/10), spleen (66.6%, 10/15), and thymus (100%, 3/3) tissues. The study demonstrates that DENV NS1 capture assays are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool. This is the first study to evaluate ELISA and ICT for detecting DENV antigens in tissues, providing a new approach for diagnosing dengue fatal cases.
A comprehensive molecular profiling study of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9 was conducted to elucidate differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry. The study utilized somatic whole exome and RNA-sequencing, as well as correlated clinical data. Somatic mutational analyses revealed significant differences in mutation frequency between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) cases, with BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 demonstrating higher mutation frequencies among AA cases. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, TP53 and IRF4 mutation frequencies were higher among CA cases. The study also found a significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency among patients with higher European admixture in the dataset. The findings suggest that further validation and functional characterization of these genes in myeloma model systems could shed light on their potential role in myelomagenesis, particularly in patients of African descent. The study represents one of the most comprehensive genomics studies of MM in patients of African descent and highlights the need for deeper understanding of oncogenic processes driving MM pathogenesis in multi-ethnic cohorts to address disparities in incidence and outcomes observed among AA or otherwise African descent patients.
The study investigates the role of passenger mutations in cancer evolution, which are mutations that do not affect the reproductive rate of cancer cells. These mutations can provide valuable information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer, serve as a molecular clock, and potentially become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. The researchers analyze the stochastic expansion of a population of cancer cells, describing the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions. They calculate the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations, ordered by their time of appearance, and compute the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees to inform the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in individual patients. The study also derives results looking backward in time, estimating the number of cancer cells present at the time when a given subclonal mutation arose. The researchers derive exact formulas for the expected numbers of subclonal mutations of any frequency and fit this formula to cancer sequencing data to estimate the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during the early stages of clonal expansion. The study shows that the frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced by both the mutation rate and the death-birth ratio of the cancer cells. The findings suggest that passenger mutations can be used to infer the parameters of the tumorigenic process and estimate the number of clonal mutations present in the first malignant cell.
Polyglutamine ( polyQ ) expansion in exon1 ( XN1 ) of the huntingtin protein is linked to Huntington's disease. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36–40 repeats, XN1 can readily form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with disease. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions, a variant missing the polyproline regions, and an isolated polyQ peptide ( Qn ) to study the misfolding of XN1 toward amyloid aggregation. The results show that polyQ peptides have a positive correlation between their probability to form a β-rich misfolded state and their expansion length. The flanking regions of XN1 affect its probability to form a β-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ. The polyproline regions form polyproline type II helices and decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a β-rich state. Additionally, by lengthening polyQ, the first N-terminal 17 residues are more likely to adopt a β-sheet conformation rather than an α-helix conformation. These findings provide a structural insight into XN1 misfolding and elucidate the possible role of the flanking sequences in XN1 aggregation. The study suggests that the polyQ and flanking regions in XN1 are strongly coupled in XN1 folding and misfolding, and that the flanking regions play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of XN1.
The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) system is a primary defense mechanism used by eubacteria and archaea to protect against foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and conjugative plasmids. By analyzing hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), researchers have explored the distribution and diversity of known CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities and discovered new CRISPRs. A targeted assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRISPR arrays that whole-metagenome assemblies failed to identify. This approach involved recruiting reads from each HMP dataset using the direct repeat consensus sequence of known CRISPR types and assembling the recruited reads into CRISPR loci. The unique spacer sequences were then extracted for analysis. The study identified 64 known and 86 novel CRISPRs, which were found to be largely body-site specific. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, with samples from the same individual and oral site sharing the most spacers. The study also demonstrated the potential applications of CRISPRs in tracing rare species and virus exposure in individuals. The results highlight the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The targeted assembly strategy improved the detection of CRISPR elements in metagenomic datasets, identifying known CRISPRs in more human microbiome datasets compared to whole-metagenome assemblies.
A genome-wide analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans has identified light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts that exhibit rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods. These transcripts are sustained under constant conditions, suggesting they are under circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. The study demonstrates circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggests that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock. The findings indicate that C. elegans has a circadian clock that is entrained by light and temperature, and that this model organism can be used to explore the evolution and function of this critical timekeeping mechanism. The study also reveals that genes implicated in metabolism are enriched in temperature-driven transcript sets, whereas genes implicated in circadian behaviors are enriched in entrained datasets. The TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit is required to transduce both light and temperature information to the clock, further supporting the existence of a circadian clock in C. elegans.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene, a homolog of human XPD, encodes a DNA helicase involved in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and transcription. Mutant alleles of RAD3 ( rad3-101 and rad3-102 ) exhibit partial defects in DNA repair and a hyper-recombination ( hyper-Rec ) phenotype. Previous studies suggested that the hyper-Rec phenotype is due to persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) by replication. To further characterize the hyper-Rec phenotype, a system was developed to recover reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. The results show that rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events revealed that three-quarters of crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids ( double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs ), while the remainder reflect DSBs formed in single chromatids ( single chromatid breaks, SCBs ). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. Genome-wide analysis of 216 unselected genomic alterations, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications, revealed a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. A hotspot for deletions and duplications was found at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. These findings suggest that a subset of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, requires optimal expression of bacterial factors to adapt to the changing host environment during persistent infection. The bacterium has a large set of simple sequence repeats ( SSRs ) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped strand mispairing ( SSM ), facilitating adaptation. This study investigated the role of an intergenically located T-tract in regulating the expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin ( SabA ). The T-tract is a repetitive DNA element that operates as a rheostat-like mechanism to fine-tune SabA promoter activity. The length of the T-tract was found to generate multiphasic output from the sabA promoter, altering H. pylori binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection isolated clones revealed that the T-tract length is a highly variable feature in H. pylori, mirroring the host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates a set of clones from which the best-fit phenotypes are selected in the host. In silico and functional in vitro analyzes showed that the length of the T-tract affects the local DNA structure and binding of the RNA polymerase, through shifting of the axial alignment between the core promoter and UP-like elements. The study identified additional genes in H. pylori with T- or A-tracts positioned similarly to that of sabA, and variations in the tract length acted as rheostats to modulate cognate promoter output. This mechanism provides an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in bacteria like H. pylori, which possesses a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors.
The JAK-STAT transcriptional regulator, STAT-5, plays a crucial role in the life cycle of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) by activating the ATM DNA damage pathway to induce genome amplification in differentiating epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that HPV proteins downregulate the expression of STAT-1, a member of the JAK-STAT family, to allow for stable maintenance of viral episomes in persistently infected cells. In contrast, this study reveals that HPV proteins activate STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. The activation of STAT-5 is necessary for HPV genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes, as inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression. The study also shows that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity, which is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. Furthermore, the study identifies the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) as a downstream target of STAT-5 that contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms by which HPV evades innate immune surveillance and establishes persistent infections, and highlight the importance of STAT-5 in promoting HPV viral replication. Overall, the study demonstrates that STAT-5 plays a critical role in the differentiation-dependent viral life cycle of HPV.
The study aimed to identify immunogenic Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) antigens expressed in chronic biliary carriers of S. Typhi in Kathmandu, Nepal. To achieve this, an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) was applied to study host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract during S. Typhi carriage. The researchers hypothesized that S. Typhi surviving in the biliary tract of humans may express a distinct antigenic profile. Thirteen S. Typhi antigens that were immunoreactive in carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area, were identified. These antigens included putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One of the identified antigens, YncE (STY1479), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in the screen. The response to YncE in patients whose biliary tract contained S. Typhi was compared to responses in patients whose biliary tract did not contain S. Typhi, patients with acute typhoid fever, and healthy controls residing in a typhoid endemic area. The results showed that seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 bile culture-negative controls (0%), 0 of 8 healthy Bangladeshis (0%), and 1 of 8 (12.5%) Bangladeshis with acute typhoid fever had detectable anti-YncE IgG in blood. Further evaluation of YncE and other antigens identified by IVIAT could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers.
A new epigenetic phenomenon, termed trans-reactivation, has been discovered in which non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene that is silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon was observed in Drosophila melanogaster, where non-functional alleles of the white gene were found to trans-reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of white that was silenced by heterochromatin. The presence of homologous RNA molecules produced by the non-functional alleles was found to be essential for trans-reactivation, and mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing were shown to affect this process. Trans-reactivation was also found to be heritable, suggesting that it is a stable and long-lasting epigenetic change. The mechanisms of trans-reactivation appear to be distinct from previously characterized epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection. Furthermore, the presence of non-functional white alleles was found to cause an increase in the expression of the wm4h gene and an opening of the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus. These findings suggest that trans-reactivation is a new level of gene expression control that is mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes. Overall, the discovery of trans-reactivation provides new insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and the role of RNA molecules in epigenetic control.
Boophilin, a multifunctional Kunitz protease inhibitor from the midgut of Rhipicephalus microplus, a tick vector of babesiosis, has been studied for its in vitro mode of action and anti-thrombotic activity. Boophilin was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity, and its interaction with thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein was investigated using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. The results showed that Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates, with a Ki of approximately 100 nM. Boophilin also inhibits FXIa, preventing FIX activation, and kallikrein activity, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). In addition, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. These findings suggest that Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, allowing ticks to successfully digest a blood meal, which is critical for metabolism and egg development. Boophilin is the first tick midgut FXIa anticoagulant also found to inhibit thrombosis.
The Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) is a computational model developed to investigate the relationship between inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut. The model integrates multiple functional modules to simulate the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture. Specifically, SEGMEnT models the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture as generated by the behavior of gut epithelial cells undergoing replication, migration, and differentiation. The model also incorporates the effect of inflammation on these morphogenic processes. SEGMEnT is designed to represent arbitrarily large and customizable epithelial surfaces and is a work in progress, representing a minimally sufficient set of components and interactions to achieve a face-valid representation of the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture and its response to inflammation. The model reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and a series of morphogen knock-out/inhibition experiments, providing insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms. These include a putative role for PTEN/PI3K as a key point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic low-level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia. The results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease. The model proposes that a broad spectrum of intestinal disease can be unified by a view that the mucosal tissue architecture, as maintained by morphogenesis pathways, is subject to a series of control modules that balance the complex interplay of multiple functional objectives when in a state of health, but can become disturbed to generate pathological conditions.
The deployment of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has been proposed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission. However, the success of this approach depends on the ability of Wolbachia to invade and establish itself in the local mosquito population. In a study conducted in the community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro, the wMelBr strain of Wolbachia was released for 20 consecutive weeks, but its frequency plateaued at around 40% after 7-19 weeks and dropped when releases stopped. The high maternal transmission rate of Wolbachia (97.56%) was observed, but the invasion trend was not affected by doubling releases or deploying mosquitoes with large wing length and low laboratory mortality. Further investigation revealed that the initial release of susceptible mosquitoes in a population highly resistant to pyrethroids jeopardized Wolbachia invasion. A new strain, wMelRio, was produced by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles, which successfully established in the population where wMelBr failed. The study highlights the importance of matching the local population genetics, particularly insecticide resistance background, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The results suggest that Wolbachia deployment should be tailored to the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to ensure its success.
The study investigated the role of the vaccinia B1 protein kinase in poxvirus replication and its interaction with the B12 pseudokinase. Experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus led to the identification of mutations that enhanced viral fitness, including a loss-of-function mutation in the B12 pseudokinase. Characterization of the adapted viruses revealed that expression of full-length B12 led to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but had no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. This suggests that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. Further investigation showed that B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus and reduces BAF phosphorylation in the absence of B1, indicating that B12 may enhance antiviral activity of BAF. The study presents novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit an epistatic relationship in a virus, potentially serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and orchestrate nuclear events during infection. The findings provide insights into poxvirus adaptation pathways and signal transduction circuitry, and raise questions regarding the underlying mechanism of action for the B12 pseudokinase and its regulation by B1. The study suggests that loss of B12 can suppress the fitness defects of B1 mutant viruses, but does not enhance replication of viruses containing a wild-type B1R gene, consistent with a model in which B12 acts as a repressor of vaccinia replication in a B1-dependent manner.
The study investigated the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary amphiphilicity in the presence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces. The peptides were designed to display amphiphilicity in an alpha-helix conformation, with hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues partitioned accordingly. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the peptides' behavior in bulk water and in the presence of interfaces. The results showed that the peptides do not adopt a single, stable conformation in bulk water, but instead exhibit multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. The alpha-helix conformation is not stable in bulk water, and the peptides display a variety of secondary structures, including partial alpha-helices. The presence of a macroscopic interface, such as a vacuum/water interface, leads to a strong partitioning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, stabilizing the alpha-helical form for both peptides. The study also found that the peptides' aggregation behavior is affected by the presence or absence of an interface, as well as their surface charge and hydrophobicity. The results suggest that the conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides is highly dependent on the environment, and that interfaces can play a crucial role in stabilizing specific conformations.
The Telomeric Repeats of Human Herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) Are Required for Efficient Virus Integration. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans within the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types. Both viruses can integrate their genomes into telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The molecular mechanism of viral integration remains elusive. Intriguingly, HHV-6A, HHV-6B and several other herpesviruses harbor arrays of telomeric repeats ( TMR ) identical to human telomere sequences at the ends of their genomes. The HHV-6A and HHV-6B genomes harbor two TMR arrays, the perfect TMR ( pTMR ) and the imperfect TMR ( impTMR ). To determine if the TMR are involved in virus integration, researchers deleted both pTMR and impTMR in the HHV-6A genome. Upon reconstitution, the TMR mutant virus replicated comparable to wild type ( wt ) virus, indicating that the TMR are not essential for HHV-6A replication. However, integration of HHV-6A was severely impaired in the absence of the TMR and the virus genome was lost rapidly, suggesting that integration is crucial for the maintenance of the virus genome. Individual deletion of the pTMR and impTMR revealed that the pTMR play the major role in HHV-6A integration, whereas the impTMR only make a minor contribution, allowing us to establish a model for HHV-6A integration. Taken together, our data shows that the HHV-6A TMR are dispensable for virus replication, but are crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells.
Poxviruses are enveloped viruses that produce infectious particles without acquiring their internal lipid membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, they generate immature particles from atypical crescent-shaped precursors whose architecture and composition are not well understood. Researchers have determined the 2. 6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 folds into two jellyrolls decorated by a head domain of novel fold and assembles into trimers that are homologous to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. When tethered onto artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice and assembly products structurally similar to the viral crescents and immature particles. The architecture of the D13 honeycomb lattice and the lipid-remodeling abilities of D13 support a model of assembly that exhibits similarities with the giant mimivirus. The findings suggest that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, D13 is the target of rifampicin and its structure will aid the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors. The study reveals that the first morphogenesis step of poxviruses relies on an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy found in a lineage of icosahedral DNA viruses. The scaffolding protein D13 is a driving force in this process and has the intrinsic ability to form immature-virion like particles in the absence of any other viral factors.
In Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium), a monocotyledonous plant, a mutation in the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene results in a dramatic elongation of seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype contrasts with Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), a dicotyledonous plant, where loss-of-function of TAA1/TAR activity leads to impaired root growth. The Brachypodium mutant, Bdtar2lhypo, displays elevated rather than reduced auxin levels, which does not appear to result from compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Instead, expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) to auxin, is increased in Bdtar2l mutants. Treatment with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC) suppresses Bdtar2lhypo root phenotypes and down-regulates BdYUCCA genes. Furthermore, BdYUCCA genes are up-regulated in a downstream ethylene-signaling component homolog mutant, Bd ethylene insensitive 2-like 1, which also displays a Bdtar2l root phenotype. These findings suggest that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation in Brachypodium. The results reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.
The organization of promoter nucleosomes plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of gene expression in species of the budding yeast. Research has shown that genes lacking a nucleosome-free region (OPN) vary widely in expression between species, whereas genes containing a depleted proximal nucleosome (DPN) exhibit conserved expression levels. To investigate whether early evolutionary dynamics contribute to this difference in divergence, scientists artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins. Surprisingly, selection was equally successful for both OPN and DPN genes, with approximately 80% of genes in each group stably increasing in expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted through distinct mechanisms: DPN-selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN-selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. Notably, when selection was removed, DPN genes rapidly reverted to wild-type expression levels, whereas OPN genes did not. These findings suggest that promoter organization constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution. The results also indicate that DPN and OPN genes respond differently to identical selection forces, with OPN genes being more adaptable due to their flexible promoter structure. Overall, the study highlights the importance of promoter nucleosome organization in shaping the evolution of gene expression.
The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein Tax activates I-κB kinases (IKKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), promoting cell proliferation and transformation. However, in most cells, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, resulting in p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. This study demonstrates that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. RelA is shown to induce this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively. The HTLV-1 anti-sense protein HBZ down-regulates NF-κB, delaying or preventing the onset of Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection, with robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression driving IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and triggering senescence, while HBZ modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve. Inactivation of the senescence checkpoint can facilitate persistent NF-κB activation and leukemogenesis.
The frontal lobes play a crucial role in decision-making and executive control by selecting and coordinating goal-directed behaviors. However, current models of frontal executive function do not adequately explain human decision-making in everyday environments characterized by uncertainty, change, and open-ended situations. To address this issue, a computational model of human executive function was proposed, which predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations. The model reveals that the human frontal function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed from those stored in long-term memory, probed, and if competitive, confirmed to drive action. The model suggests that the human executive function has a monitoring capacity limited to three or four behavioral strategies, which is compensated by a binary structure of executive control that promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies in ambiguous and unknown situations. The results support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. The proposed model, called PROBE, clarifies how the human executive function regulates the exploration versus exploitation of behavioral rules and controls creativity in the service of adaptive behavior.
The article presents a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to analyze the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions. ADAPT employs mathematical modeling to predict the dynamics of molecular adaptations by introducing a concept of time-dependent descriptions of model parameters. This approach integrates experimental data obtained during different stages of an intervention to provide an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression. ADAPT aims to dynamically link different experimentally observed phenotypes (phenotype snapshots) as a function of time. The method captures dynamic adaptations in molecular processes by inferring necessary changes in model parameters, which are therefore time-dependent. ADAPT was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to predict metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. The analysis revealed a counter-intuitive insight concerning the function of scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Although activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, the computational analysis showed that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of SR-B1 in hepatic membranes. The study demonstrates the potential of ADAPT to identify potential unwanted side effects and design new target interventions to prevent them.
The article proposes a new hypothesis for how the spinocerebellar systems and cerebellar cortex interact to support the coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. The hypothesis suggests that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations of sensory and motor signals to the cerebellar cortex through its mossy fiber (MF) projections via the spinocerebellar tract (SCT) and spinocerebellar reticulotrigeminal tract (SRT) systems. These recombinations can be described as linear projections through aspects of the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The granule cells in the cerebellar granule layer enhance the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cells to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems. The authors argue that the close correspondence between sensor signals and motor command signals in individual neurons allows the spinocerebellar system to avoid superfluous recombinations and form ‘good enough’ recombinations with a high probability. The article aims to provide a theoretical explanation for how the spinocerebellar systems and cerebellar cortex can integrate across input dimensions necessary to achieve coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies.
The study investigated the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Aedes albopictus, a major vector of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), during CHIKV infection. Using next-generation sequencing, the researchers identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected Aedes albopictus cell lines, respectively, as well as nine novel miRNAs. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 common miRNAs, with eight miRNAs specifically altered by CHIKV infection. Putative targets of these regulated miRNAs were identified and classified into their pathways. The study found that CHIKV infection modified the miRNA profile of Aedes albopictus, highlighting the potential role of miRNAs in CHIKV pathogenesis. Further analysis revealed that four miRNAs (miR-100, miR-283, miR-305-3p, and miR-927) were over-expressed, while four miRNAs (miR-1000, miR-2b, miR-2c-3p, and miR-190-5p) were under-expressed in response to CHIKV infection. The study provides insights into the cellular modification by miRNAs during CHIKV infection and identifies potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies. The findings suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and may be involved in various cellular processes, including cell development, proliferation, differentiation, host defense, fat metabolism, and apoptosis.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic infection affecting humans and livestock, poses a significant medical and economic burden in many developing countries, including Iran. This study aimed to estimate the monetary burden of CE in Iran using epidemiological and economic data from 2000-2009. The estimated mean number of surgical CE cases per year was 1,295, and the number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was approximately 635,232. The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at $93.39 million, while the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at $132 million. The cost per surgical human case was estimated at $1,539. The economic impact of CE on Iran was found to be considerable, accounting for approximately 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The study highlights the need for the establishment of a CE surveillance system and implementation of a control program to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. A cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended to prioritize resource allocation for disease control and prevention.
A global analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) infection in mouse NIH3T6 cells has revealed dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression. Deep sequencing was used to follow MPyV infection at various times after infection and analyze both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The results showed that both early-strand and late-strand RNAs were transcribed at all time points, indicating a transcriptional profile of the early-to-late switch. Novel insights into viral gene expression emerged, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late times in infection. By late times in infection, 359 host genes were significantly upregulated and 857 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated. The levels of several long noncoding RNAs were also altered, with the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 being downregulated and several other abundant noncoding RNAs being strongly upregulated. These findings provide a detailed picture of how viral gene expression changes throughout the life cycle of MPyV and how infection impacts host cell gene expression. The results also reveal new insights into viral gene regulation, including changes in apparent start sites of early transcripts and extensive RNA editing throughout the viral genome.
Metabolic Factors Limiting Performance in Marathon Runners: A Computational Study
    A significant proportion of marathon runners experience severe and performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall." Previous analyses have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without "hitting the wall." However, a computational study demonstrates that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed.

    The study presents an analytic approach to estimate the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity. This approach provides a basis for guidelines ensuring the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners by setting personally appropriate paces and prescribing midrace fueling requirements. The analysis also sheds light on important standards in marathon running, such as qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.

    The study shows that carbohydrate loading prior to marathon running influences performance by permitting runners to run at greater speeds without "hitting the wall." Typical levels of glycogen loading allow runners with a given aerobic capacity and leg muscle distribution to complete a marathon safely in four to five hours. The model incorporates the metabolic cost of running and the dependence of fat versus carbohydrate metabolism on relative exertion, revealing the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion and the fastest pace at which a given distance can be run without exhausting glycogen stores.
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects a wide range of hosts, including humans, and exhibits significant genetic diversity, with three main clonal lineages (type I, II, and III) found in Europe and North America. However, in South America, a diverse array of other strains are present. The parasite's virulence, persistence, and ability to induce cytokine expression and modulate host gene expression vary widely among strains. This study aimed to investigate the molecular basis for these differences in pathogenesis, particularly in non-canonical strains, by infecting murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains representing global diversity. The researchers used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. The results showed large differences in the expression levels of known parasite effectors and chromosomal structural variation among strains. Additionally, novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways were identified, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. The study found that IFNβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts. The findings provide a global insight into host cell and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic Toxoplasma strains, allowing for the identification of novel strain-specific host cell responses and parasite effectors.
The recombination process in enteroviruses has been found to be a biphasic replicative process involving the generation of greater-than-genome-length ‘imprecise’ intermediates. A novel reverse genetic approach was used to investigate heterologous recombination in polioviruses, resulting in the isolation of intermediate chimeric intertypic polioviruses with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses yielded progeny with increased fitness that had lost the duplicated sequences. Mutations or inhibitors that altered polymerase fidelity or the coalescence of replication complexes affected the yield of recombinants, indicating that the process is replicative. The study proposes that extant recombinants result from an initial recombination event followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. This biphasic process has implications for our understanding of ‘evolution by duplication’ in positive-strand RNA viruses. An analysis of intertypic poliovirus type 1/type 3 recombinants revealed that 70% of genomes contained additional sequences, forming 85% of distinct sequence junctions analyzed. The majority of heterotypic recombinants contained additional sequences within the recombination region, suggesting that these imprecise recombinants may have a growth disadvantage. However, serial passage of these viruses yielded progeny with increased fitness that had lost the duplicated sequences. The study suggests that the recombination process in enteroviruses is a complex and dynamic process that can be influenced by factors such as polymerase fidelity and replication complex coalescence.
The study investigated the role of organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) in the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue (WAT) and its impact on thermogenesis and lipolysis. The researchers found that Oct3 is highly expressed in WAT and has the highest uptake rate of NE compared to other known routes, such as sympathetic neurons or macrophages. Adipocytes in WAT express high levels of NE degradation enzymes, Maoa, Maob, and Comt, which provide the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Ablation of Oct3 in mice resulted in higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, WAT in Oct3-deficient mice showed stronger browning characteristics and elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. The response involved enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolished the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient WAT, indicating NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes. The study suggests that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders. Reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 were also associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR).
The heterochromatin-enriched HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating transcription by binding to methylated histone H3 tails through their chromo-domain (CD). However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, suggesting the need for additional histone binding activities. The chromoshadow-domain (CSD) of HP1 proteins interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm. This interaction is essential for efficient SWI/SNF remodeling, which is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is observed on interferon-regulated genes in vivo. Furthermore, SWI/SNF activity favors the loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both in vivo and in vitro. The data suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling. The interaction between HP1 and Brg1/Brm with the globular domain of histone H3 is required for HP1-mediated repression, indicating a complex interplay between these proteins in regulating chromatin structure and transcription.
The study investigated the property of self-containment in RNA molecules, which refers to the tendency of a particular RNA sequence to maintain its optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. The researchers developed a scoring method called the self-containment index to measure this property. They found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not display high self-containment. Further analysis revealed a trend toward higher self-containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. The study also found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and that there is a trend toward natural selection for self-containment in most functional RNA classes. The researchers suggest that self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. They propose that analysis of self-containment will be important for both annotation and design of functional RNAs. A Python implementation and Web interface to calculate the self-containment index are available online.
The study identifies four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that limit the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Arabidopsis mutants defective in any of these TFs, namely ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810, displayed increased disease susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Transcriptome analyses revealed that these mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes. Several of these up-regulated genes encode peptides with a secretion signal, which were named PROVIR (provirulence) factors. Forward and reverse genetic analyses revealed that many of the PROVIR factors are important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. Over-expression of many PROVIR factors in Arabidopsis conferred increased susceptibility to P. cucumerina, while loss-of-function mutants conferred increased resistance. The TFs and PROVIRs identified in this study represent novel genetic determinants for plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. These findings provide new insights into the molecular components and host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility. The study highlights the importance of understanding the intricate signaling system used by host cells to respond to invasions by pathogenic microorganisms.
The transcription factor FOXO1 plays a critical role in regulating uterine epithelial integrity and progesterone receptor expression, which are essential for successful embryo implantation. Ablation of Foxo1 in the uterine epithelium of mice using the progesterone receptor Cre ( PgrCre ) model resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations in gene expression for transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-catenin ( CTNNB1 ) signaling pathway, and increased progesterone receptor ( PGR ) signaling. The increase in PGR signaling was attributed to PGR expression being retained in the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial PGR during this receptive period inhibited FOXO1 expression in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium. The reciprocal expression of PGR and FOXO1 was conserved in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phase. This study demonstrates that FOXO1 and PGR expression are interrelated and critical for embryo implantation. FOXO1 regulates the expression of multiple components of signaling pathways that establish the receptive phase, including activation of cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, CTNNB1 signaling pathway, and inhibition of PGR signaling in the murine endometrial epithelium. These findings suggest that FOXO1 and PGR may be involved in a mutually regulatory relationship in the endometrial epithelium at the window of receptivity.
A geostatistical model was developed to investigate the spatial variation in monthly dengue cases in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2009. The model accounted for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects, and was applied to district-level monthly reported dengue cases. The results showed that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Additionally, mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and districts bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of annual dengue cases occurred between August and September, with 94% of cases identified in the capital Dhaka. However, less than half of the affected districts reported cases, with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts but dropping towards the end of the high transmission season. The study provides model-based estimates of the monthly geographical distribution of dengue cases in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting. The findings are expected to contribute to prioritizing and targeting dengue control and elimination interventions across Bangladesh.
Mice exhibit exploratory behavior in a novel environment by establishing a preferred place, known as a home base, characterized by high visit frequency and cumulative time spent. However, a new type of preferred place, called a knot, has been identified in mouse open field exploration. Knots are marked by high path tortuosity, with mice tracing tortuous paths full of twists and turns during sporadic visits. This behavior, termed knot-scribbling, is distinct from home base behavior and is often performed at the point of introduction into the arena. Knots are characterized by high path density, frequent visits without scribbling, and higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out. Mice tend to perform knot-scribbling at the point of entry into the arena, even if they leave immediately after being placed there. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling. Knots may serve as self-generated landmarks, allowing mice to obtain an overview of the environment and re-calibrate their locale map and compass directions. The vestibular input generated by knot-scribbling may also improve the interpretation of the visual scene. Knots are typically situated away from walls and are not characterized by the features of a home base, except for high speed during inbound and low speed during outbound paths.
Invasive fungal infections cause more deaths worldwide than malaria. A high-throughput screen identified the ergoline compound NGx04 as an antifungal agent with selectivity over mammalian cells. Chemogenomics analysis revealed that NGx04 targets the lipid transfer protein Sec14p, which is essential for the growth and virulence of pathogenic fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans. Sec14p is involved in the secretion of virulence determinants necessary for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans, making it an attractive antifungal target. NGx04 inhibited the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans and NGx04-related compounds showed equal or higher potency against this pathogen. Furthermore, NGx04 analogues exhibited fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans strain. The Sec14p protein is highly conserved across fungal species, with 53% similarity between S. cerevisiae and C. neoformans proteins. Three of the four sites critical for NGx04 sensitivity are conserved in C. neoformans, suggesting that NGx04 binds to the fungal protein in a similar manner as in S. cerevisiae. These findings provide genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and initial data supporting NGx04 as a novel antifungal starting point.
Mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, has been found to possess promising antischistosomal properties in mice. In a study, mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum were administered a single dose of mefloquine ( 200 or 400 mg/kg ) orally, resulting in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions ( 72. 3%–100% ). Notably, high worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Both mefloquine erythro-enantiomers resulted in high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions when given to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infection. The study suggests that mefloquine may be a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. Mefloquine is widely used to treat malaria, and it will be interesting to investigate its impact on schistosomiasis in areas where both diseases co-exist. The study highlights the potential of mefloquine as an alternative to the currently used antischistosomal drug, praziquantel, which may select for drug-resistant parasites.
The study aimed to map the geographical distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon using parasitological, serological, and clinical evidence to exclude other causes of lymphedema. Podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis, causes massive swelling of the lower legs and was identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study employed a multi-stage sampling design, stratifying the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis, and surveyed 76 villages from 40 health districts across the ten regions of Cameroon. A total of 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated in the study, and 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified. After applying a clinical algorithm to exclude filarial-associated lymphedema, 52 people were diagnosed with podoconiosis. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4-0.7). The disease was found to be widespread in Cameroon, with at least one case identified in every region except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa. The prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 2.7% across the 40 health districts surveyed. The study demonstrates the low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon, highlighting the need for a health system response to the burden of the disease through case surveillance and morbidity management services. The findings support the inclusion of podoconiosis in routine screening for neglected tropical diseases at the primary healthcare level.
This study investigated the role of Notch signaling in the age-associated decrease in adhesion of germline stem cells (GSCs) to their niche in Drosophila. The results show that Notch signaling is increased with age in GSCs, leading to their removal from the niche. Clonal analysis revealed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, out-competing their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This increased adhesiveness is mediated by the regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch signaling in GSCs accelerates their age-dependent loss from the niche, and this loss is partially mediated by Sex lethal. However, disruption of Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay GSC loss during aging, nor does it affect BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of GSCs. Notably, Notch activation in the niche, which maintains niche integrity and mediates GSC retention, is reduced with age. This suggests that Notch signaling regulates GSC-niche adhesion both intrinsically and extrinsically. The study reveals a novel role of Notch signaling in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging and has implications for understanding metastatic cancer cells, in which Notch signaling suppresses cell adhesion. Overall, the findings indicate that Notch signaling promotes GSC aging and needs to be maintained at a relatively low level in young GSCs for their anchorage to the niche.
The conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs) are a family of kinases encoded by eight human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). These kinases share sequence and positional homology with the UL97 protein of HCMV, which has been shown to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A/C. A functional complementation assay demonstrated that UL97 has authentic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-like activity. To determine if this Cdk-like activity is shared by other CHPKs, the authors individually expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human cells and yeast cells. The results showed that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs, but not the alpha-herpesvirus homologs, can phosphorylate Rb and lamin A, disrupt the nuclear lamina, and display bona fide Cdk activity in yeast. These findings indicate that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs have Cdk-like functions, which have been termed v-Cdks. In contrast, the non-Cdk-related activities reported for UL97, such as dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and disruption of cytoplasmic or nuclear aggresomes, showed weak conservation among the CHPKs and did not segregate to specific viral families. These results suggest that the genomic and evolutionary conservation of these kinases has not been fully maintained at the functional level.
Systematic Review and Consensus Guidelines for Environmental Sampling of Burkholderia pseudomallei
    Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Tier 1 Select Agent and the cause of melioidosis, is a Gram-negative bacillus present in the environment in many tropical countries. A systematic review was conducted to update the risk map for melioidosis and propose international consensus guidelines for soil sampling. An international working party, the Detection of Environmental Burkholderia pseudomallei Working Party ( DEBWorP ), was formed during the VIth World Melioidosis Congress in 2010. PubMed was searched using MeSH terms: pseudomallei or melioidosis, and bibliographies were hand-searched for secondary references. The reported geographical distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment was mapped and categorized as definite, probable, or possible. The methodology used for detecting environmental B. pseudomallei was extracted and collated. The review found that global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not all were robust. To address these issues, consensus guidelines were developed to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and ‘low-tech’ methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries. The proposed guidelines aim to provide the basis for an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei.
The mechanism of membrane fusion by flaviviruses, such as dengue virus, involves large-scale domain rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein (E) and a transition from dimers to trimers. A conformational intermediate, characterized by an outward rotation of the E ectodomain and reassociation into extended trimers, is believed to play a crucial role in this process. The ∼55-aa-residue membrane proximal "stem" of the E protein is thought to zip up along domain II, bringing together the transmembrane segments of the C-terminus and the fusion loops at the tip of domain II. Researchers have identified peptides derived from the stem of dengue-virus E that bind to a stem-less E trimer, which models a conformational intermediate. These peptides specifically block viral fusion in vitro and inhibit infectivity with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformational intermediate. The peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion. A two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition has been proposed, suggesting that targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection. The findings support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion, providing strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.
Biomedical researchers have developed a novel method for whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Vibrio cholerae directly from dried spotted filter paper. This approach enables the analysis of cholera strains in resource-limited settings, providing valuable information for public health policy and control measures. The study demonstrated that a minimum concentration of 0.02 ng/μL of V. cholerae DNA is sufficient for WGS, allowing for the recovery of close to a complete sequence of the V. cholerae O1 genome. The genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. Furthermore, WGS identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from alkaline peptone water (APW)-enriched specimen spotted filter papers, highlighting the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome and identify co-infections that may impact disease severity. The WGS results also mapped short reads from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers, providing molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. The study's findings support the use of WGS for molecular epidemiological characterization of cholera outbreaks in remote and/or unstable areas, enabling the identification of specific virulence genes and the absence of genes implicated in important biological pathways of V. cholerae. This approach has the potential to inform public health policy and contribute to the control and elimination of cholera.
The study investigated the role of the cytoplasmic Dynein motor in regulating epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells. A genetic screen identified Dynein as an essential regulator of apico–basal polarity, and further analysis revealed that it acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust ( Sdt ) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs. The study found that Dynein is required for the apical targeting of specific Sdt mRNA isoforms, which is mediated by an alternatively spliced coding exon. The presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in Sdt mRNA localization, where apical transcripts are only found during early stages of epithelial development and unlocalized transcripts predominate in mature epithelia. This work demonstrates that Dynein is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may have a functional role in regulating apico–basal organization. The study also introduces a unique mechanism in which alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development. The findings are supported by a complementary study that examined the contributions of Dynein and Crumbs mRNA localization to apico–basal polarity regulation. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial polarity and highlights the importance of mRNA localization in regulating cell architecture.
This study provides the first evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Trypanosomatids, specifically in Leishmania infantum, using two fluorescent transgenic clones. The researchers developed transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters to investigate whether cells with identical genotypes can recognize each other and mate. The study found that both types of markers were successfully exchanged within the sand fly midgut of the natural vector Phlebotomus perniciosus when individuals from these species were fed with a mixture of parental clones. The hybrid progeny appeared to be triploid based on DNA content analysis and was stable throughout the complete parasite life cycle. Infections by the hybrid clone in BALB/c mice caused a reduction in parasite loads in both spleen and liver, and provided weight values similar to those obtained with uninfected mice. Spleen arginase activity was also significantly reduced relative to parental strains. The study demonstrates the ability of L. infantum to recognize the same genotype and mate, suggesting the existence of a non-obligate sexual cycle in the extracellular stage of the parasite within the sand fly vector. The yellow hybrid progeny is stable throughout the whole parasite life cycle but with a slower virulence, which correlates well with the lower arginase activity detected both in vitro and in vivo infections.
A recent study examined 63 Leishmania donovani strains isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or HIV-VL co-infections in northwestern and southern Ethiopia. The strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), cysteine protease B (cpb), and HASPB (k26). The results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290 bp product, while a minority (4/40) gave a 410 bp amplicon, all of which were isolated from patients with HIV-VL co-infections. In contrast, almost all strains (20/23) from southern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp amplicon. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis distinguished the different PCR products. Sequence analysis revealed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs, with the 13 amino acid peptide motifs being prevalent in L. donovani but rare in L. infantum. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani vary between geographic regions, indicating considerable polymorphism in the HASPB repeat region (k26) among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa. These findings have implications for the design of diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen.
A probabilistic model of HIV-1 copy-choice recombination has been developed to predict the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV-1 genome. The model is based on local sequence identity and accurately predicts the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV-1 genome. In regions where the observed frequencies of breakpoints deviate from the predicted distribution, natural selection is inferred to be influencing the recombination pattern. The envelope gene is found to have a paucity of recombination breakpoints, suggesting that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. In contrast, breakpoints at a higher frequency than predicted by the model are found at either side of the envelope gene, indicating increased selection for these recombinants. These findings suggest that only a minority of recombination events appear to be of significance to the evolution of HIV-1. The model was applied to recombinant sequences from the HIV-1 pandemic and compared to the distributions of inter-subtype breakpoints derived from complete genome HIV-1 recombinants. The observed inter-subtype breakpoint frequencies fall within a 90% confidence interval across much of the HIV-1 genome. Regions that deviate from this expected distribution are inferred to include the breakpoints that are of greater importance as a consequence of the mosaic structures they have generated. The study provides a clear indication that the majority of recombinant breakpoints detected in the HIV-1 pandemic provide limited selective advantage, with the exception of specific genomic regions.
Title: Hierarchical Bayesian Inference for Concurrent Model Fitting and Comparison for Group Studies

A novel hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework has been proposed to address the interdependent problems of model fitting and comparison in group studies. Previous research has relied on separate statistical methods to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects and to compare candidate models. However, this approach has limitations, as the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which other subjects express the model. The proposed HBI framework combines previous approaches and has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison. Theoretical and experimental results show that the parameters estimated by HBI have smaller errors compared to other methods, and model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and not biased towards overly simplistic models. Additionally, the fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-tests. The HBI framework is hierarchical, with parameters at the individual level regularized by statistics across all individuals in the group, and Bayesian, with uncertainties at both individual and group levels represented by probability distributions. This approach addresses issues of statistical inference over both parameters and models, which have remained elusive with previous hierarchical methods.
The development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem involves the coordinated action of rhombomeres (r) and their associated Hox genes. Rhombomeres r4 contribute to the formation of functionally linked sensory and motor components of the auditory system, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and motor olivocochlear neurons. The Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 genes play a crucial role in regulating the assembly of these components, and their inactivation leads to hearing impairments. Specifically, Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 mutant mice exhibit a loss of transmission of low-level auditory stimuli. In contrast, Hoxa2 regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. The results suggest that individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. Furthermore, a single rhombomere, r4, contributes to various derivatives of the auditory pathway, which are distributed across several rhombomeres via selective migrations and structurally linked into functional circuits essential for proper hearing. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Hox genes in the assembly of sensorimotor functional circuits in the developing hindbrain.
The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40) has been found to possess an extraordinary ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. The complete genome sequence of Sde 2-40 reveals an unusually large number of enzymes that can break down over 10 different complex polysaccharides. These enzymes exhibit novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules, suggesting adaptations that facilitate the depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. Notably, Sde 2-40 is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium capable of degrading plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment.

Genomic, qRT-PCR, enzyme activity, and MS studies demonstrate that Sde 2-40 carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including glucose repression. The more complex the polysaccharide, the more enzyme systems are induced. Sde 2-40 has been shown to grow on plants as sole carbon sources while fully degrading them, making it the first marine prokaryote to do so. The bacterium is a member of the gamma-subclass of the phylum Proteobacteria and is related to cellulolytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are symbionts of shipworms. The discovery of Sde 2-40's enzymatic capabilities suggests a significant role in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "super-degrader" and mediating the breakdown of complex polysaccharides from plants, algae, and invertebrates.
The study investigated the infectivity of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) and genotype III (GIII) in Culex pipiens mosquitoes from China. The researchers found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. Both genotypes were detectable in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes at similar transmission rates, suggesting the potential of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes for transmission of both genotype viruses. The study also showed that the infection rates and growth kinetics in orally infected Cx. pipiens mosquitoes showed no significant difference between GI- and GIII-infected groups. After the establishment of infection, Cx. pipiens mosquitoes disseminated both JEV genotypes to secondary organs at similar rates of dissemination. The results indicate that GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, suggesting that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. However, the conclusion is based on the use of a single representative JEV strain from each genotype, and further studies with more different GI and GIII JEV strains are needed to confirm this conclusion. The findings of this study provide insights into the role of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in JEV transmission and genotype shift.
A two-year review of dengue deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014 was conducted to investigate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of fatal cases. The study analyzed 322 dengue deaths, with a mean age of 40.7 years and a majority of cases (72.5%) occurring in adults aged 15-59 years. The median duration of first medical contact and hospitalization was 1 and 3 days, respectively. Common co-morbidities among adults and the elderly included diabetes and hypertension. Warning signs such as lethargy and vomiting were reported, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. However, 22.4% of cases did not exhibit any warning signs. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) was the leading cause of death, accounting for over 70% of cases, followed by severe organ involvement and severe bleeding. The study found that DSS was the primary cause of death across all age groups. The review highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue-related deaths. The study's findings emphasize the importance of strengthening the surveillance system to capture dengue-related deaths that occur outside of hospital settings. This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of fatal dengue cases in Malaysia, contributing to a better understanding of the disease and its management.
The study investigated the role of tissue-specific insulin signaling in mediating female sexual attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster. Insulin signaling is a nutrient-sensing pathway that governs investment in survival versus reproduction. The researchers found that global manipulation of insulin signaling affects female sexual attractiveness, and this effect is mediated by insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells. The signals from these cells are integrated by pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes. The study demonstrated that functional ovaries are required for global insulin signaling effects on attractiveness, and manipulations of insulin signaling specifically in late follicle cells recapitulated effects of global manipulations. In contrast, modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. The study also found that tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, indicating that insulin pathway activity is a reliable link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded distinctly to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. These findings suggest that female attractiveness results from an apparent connection between attractiveness cues and an organismal state of high fecundity, both of which are created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells.
During the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, the disease spread heterogeneously across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, a statistical modeling approach was applied to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each affected district and country. The study used weekly incident case numbers to estimate growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak. A mixed effects model was fitted to account for heterogeneity between and within countries, and R0 was calculated based on predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution. The results showed that R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone at the district level. At the national level, R0 was estimated to be 0.97 (95% CI 0.77-1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% CI 0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95% CI 1.32-2.00) for Sierra Leone. The study found that socio-demographic variables related to urbanization, such as high population density and high wealth index, were positively associated with R0, suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD. The findings support the notion of geographical heterogeneity in the transmission of EVD in West Africa and highlight the importance of considering local epidemic growth during large-scale multifocal epidemics.
The relationship between a protein’s rate of evolution and its structural properties, as well as its age, has been a topic of ongoing debate in the scientific community. A recent study investigated the interplay between these two factors using a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures. The results showed that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates, such as the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate, also hold within each age group. However, the study found that age plays a crucial role in modulating the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate, and that younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older proteins despite being less designable. Additionally, the study found that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones. The results suggest that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution. Furthermore, the study ruled out the possibility that structural biases among age groups could explain the reported differences in evolutionary rates with age. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between protein age and evolutionary rate, and highlights the importance of considering both intrinsic and historical factors in understanding protein evolution.
Polycomb-Like 3 (Pcl3) is a component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that plays a crucial role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Pcl3 interacts with Suz12, a core component of PRC2, and promotes the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a mark associated with gene silencing. Knockdown of Pcl3 in ESCs leads to increased spontaneous differentiation, indicating that Pcl3 is essential for maintaining ESC self-renewal. Pcl3 also promotes the recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic sites, particularly CpG islands, which are regulatory regions of the genome. ChIP-seq analysis reveals that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 at target loci, and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets. The Tudor domain of Pcl3, which recognizes methylated histones, is essential for its function, as mutation of conserved residues within this domain compromises H3K27me3 formation. Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets. Overexpression of Pcl3 increases H3K27me3 levels, while decreasing Pcl3 levels reduces H3K27me3 levels. These findings suggest that Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that regulates ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and the recruitment of PRC2 to specific genomic sites.
This study investigates the regulation of chemoreceptor gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans in response to changes in feeding state. The chemoreceptor gene, srh-234, is specifically expressed in the ADL sensory neuron and its expression levels are dynamically modulated by the feeding state of the animal. The MEF-2 transcription factor is shown to act together with basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors to regulate srh-234 expression as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory MEF2 binding site is identified as necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234 expression, while an E-box site is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. The bHLH transcription factors HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4 are found to act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression. Additionally, the study reveals that the expression levels of srh-234 in ADL neurons are regulated remotely by MXL-3 and HLH-30 acting in the intestine, which is dependent on insulin signaling functioning specifically in ADL neurons. This non-cell-autonomous regulation involves a subset of insulin-like peptides. The results suggest that chemoreceptor gene expression is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms mediated by MEF2 and bHLH factors, allowing animals to fine-tune their chemosensory responses in response to changes in their feeding state.
This study investigated the association between the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from 2004 to 2009 and screened for M. ulcerans using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in permanent residents of these towns was tallied to determine the average cumulative incidence of BU in each location. A strong dose-response relationship was found between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). The results suggest that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia. This finding has implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. The study also highlights the importance of public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors to endemic areas. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the spread of M. ulcerans to humans in southeastern Australia. The study's findings may also have implications for other BU endemic areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where the majority of BU cases occur globally.
A mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial Mg2+ channel MRS2 has been identified as the cause of demyelination in dmy/dmy rats. The mutation results from a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 gene, which generates a novel splice acceptor site and leads to the functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA validated this finding. The Mrs2 gene encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. In dmy/dmy rats, mitochondrial deficits were observed, including elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, reduced ATP levels, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 was dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and was ultrastructurally observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria. These findings suggest that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin. The demyelination observed in dmy/dmy rats is likely enhanced by activated microglia and astroglia. The Mrs2dmy mutation is a loss-of-function mutation of the Mrs2 gene, which encodes a Mg2+ transporter protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This study provides a unique model system to investigate the maintenance of myelin and the pathomechanisms underlying demyelination.
The current documentation standards of microarray gene expression signatures hinder their application in clinical practice due to inconsistencies in study-internal and study-external diagnoses. An analysis of eight publicly available clinical microarray studies revealed that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as high as 30% in the worst-case scenario and 18% on average. These discrepancies occur because documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes, and the exact quantitative specification of a classification rule alone does not define a signature unambiguously. To address this issue, the authors propose a documentation by value strategy that documents quantitative preprocessing information, which reduces the median discrepancy to 1%. This approach improves the consistency of diagnoses based on gene expression diagnostic signatures. The study highlights the importance of unambiguous documentation of signatures for their evaluation and application in clinical practice. The results suggest that better documentation of signatures can substantially improve the process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice. The proposed documentation by value strategy is a crucial step towards making gene expression signatures a reliable tool for diagnosis and prognosis of disease.
The study presents crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA, revealing steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets. These findings demonstrate a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids, such as Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β. Two D-enantiomeric peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β, were found to inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, CsgA fibrils were shown to cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-β, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. The study suggests a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms and hypothesizes on the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases. The findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation and highlight the potential for repurposing anti-amyloid compounds as anti-biofilm agents. Curli proteins, produced by Enterobacteriaceae, mediate host cell adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation, promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. The study’s results have implications for understanding the role of amyloids in biofilm formation and the development of new therapeutic strategies to target amyloid-structured biofilms.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a significant cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and long-term neuropsychological sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE has not been well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The review identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 reports of clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. The 18 clinical studies reported 257 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013, with JEV being the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age, with 6-7% of cases resulting in death. Surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. The review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance is needed to quantify the burden of JE, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures. The evidence suggests that JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, supporting consideration of inclusion of JE vaccine in the national immunization program.
A large-scale computational study was conducted to investigate the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacterial species. The study analyzed the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across various simulated growth environments and found that variations in genetic robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. The study decoupled metabolic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent. The environmental-dependent component accounts for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, with specialized species exhibiting higher robustness. In contrast, the environmental-independent component is associated with a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, with higher robustness observed in fast-growing organisms or those with extensive secondary metabolite production. The study also identified reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. The results suggest that the need to increase metabolic capacities has driven the evolution of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks. The study's findings support the notion that environmental robustness contributes to genetic robustness, with a significant correlation observed between environmental robustness and the modularity of metabolic networks. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacterial species.
A randomised trial was conducted to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunisation in pre-school children and the impact of praziquantel treatment on this outcome. The study, known as the Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation (IMoChI) study, took place in Entebbe, Uganda, and enrolled 193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. The children were randomised to receive praziquantel treatment 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles catch-up immunisation. Plasma anti-measles IgG levels were measured at enrolment, 1 week, and 24 weeks after immunisation. The results showed that S. mansoni-infected children had lower anti-measles IgG levels and a lower percentage of protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children at 1 week post-immunisation. However, among S. mansoni-infected children, those who received praziquantel treatment before or at the time of immunisation had higher anti-measles IgG levels compared to those who did not receive treatment. At 24 weeks post-immunisation, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who remained S. mansoni stool-positive compared to those who became stool-negative. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may impair antibody responses to measles immunisation, and that praziquantel treatment may improve the response.
The evolution of bacterial populations can be better understood through large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, are limited when dealing with extensive sampling scenarios and high recombination rates. To address this, the authors introduce several statistical tools for detecting and representing recombination between populations, as well as a model-based description of population shape in sequence space. These tools are integrated with phylogenetic analysis to provide a more comprehensive understanding of bacterial population structure. The authors demonstrate the potential of this approach using extensive real data from the genus Neisseria, which exhibits high recombination rates and occasional horizontal gene flow between species. The statistical tools are implemented in the BAPS 5. 2 software, which is freely available for download. The authors emphasize the importance of interpreting the results with care, using complementary phylogenetic methods and auxiliary knowledge about the strains under investigation. The BAPS software is capable of capturing various biological signals hidden in molecular data, but requires careful interpretation of the identified populations. The authors validate their approach using a population sample of 5086 strains of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica species, assuming a simplified evolutionary model of bacterial populations with a common local ancestor and a global ancestor. The results demonstrate the potential of the integrated approach for analyzing bacterial population structures on an unprecedented scale.
A computational model was developed to investigate the role of top-down beta rhythms in supporting selective attention. The model simulated sensory cortical areas and found that top-down beta rhythms, generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas, can activate ascending synaptic projections from layer 5 ( L5 ) to layers 2/3 ( L2/3 ) and layer 4 ( L4 ). These projections are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons in L5 were shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. The model predicted that these cells play a critical role in attentional gain modulation, providing a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. The results suggest that top-down beta rhythms can enhance gamma rhythms in L2/3, reduce beta rhythms in L2/3, and increase spiking activity of L2/3 regular spiking ( RS ) cells when attention is focused on a specific region of interest ( RF ). This is consistent with neurophysiological findings that attention enhances neural responses to stimuli. The model proposes that interlaminar interaction, regulated by top-down beta rhythms, supports selective attention by biasing competition in superficial layers.
The article presents a new method for calibrating and predicting stochastic compartmental epidemic models using real-time surveillance data. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the true epidemic state using each new surveillance observation. The authors evaluate the accuracy of MSS using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen and compare its performance to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The results show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters, such as mean duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. The authors find that MSS significantly outperforms the benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. The method addresses several major challenges inherent in parameter estimation and model-based prediction during outbreaks, where the true epidemic state can be only partially observed and the behavior of disease spread is most stochastic. The authors demonstrate the potential of MSS for improving predictions about the future course of epidemics.
The article presents a comprehensive study on the laws of concatenated perception in human visual processing. The research reveals that every instant of perception is influenced by a cascade of brain processes shaped by the history of sensory and decisional events. Using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches, the study investigates the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. The results show that human visual perception is subject to two contrasting forces: low-level adaptation, which repels perception away from previous stimuli, and decisional traces, which attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. This hierarchy of serial dependence is characterized by "continuity fields" arising from the inertia of decisional templates, rather than low-level sensory processes. The study proposes a Two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The findings suggest that functionally distinct mechanisms operating at different stages promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time. The study provides a unified account of serial dependence, highlighting the interplay between sensory adaptation and decisional inertia in shaping visual experience and reactions to environmental stimuli. The results have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying human perception and decision-making.
The Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) heterodimer plays a crucial role in circadian transcription in Drosophila. To investigate the contribution of transcription to core circadian timekeeping, researchers analyzed the effects of a CYC-viral protein 16 (VP16) fusion protein in Drosophila. The addition of VP16 to the CLK-CYC complex significantly enhanced transcriptional activity compared to the wild-type CLK-CYC complex. This increased activity was observed in both S2 cells and flies expressing the CYC-VP16 fusion protein. The enhanced transcriptional activity resulted in increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes. Notably, the flies expressing CYC-VP16 exhibited a short period, suggesting that circadian transcription contributes to period determination. Further analysis of reporter gene expression in CYC-VP16-expressing flies revealed that the short period was due, at least in part, to a more rapid transcriptional phase. Importantly, the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies required a per promoter and were therefore unlikely to be a consequence of generally higher PER levels. These findings indicate that the timing of transcriptional activation, rather than the activation itself, is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. Overall, the results suggest that circadian transcription plays a significant role in core circadian function in Drosophila.
The ability of horizontally acquired genes to confer new traits in different species is often attributed to their autonomous functionality. However, this study reveals that proteins preexisting in an organism can constrain the functionality of a horizontally acquired gene product if it operates on an ancestral pathway. The researchers investigated how the horizontally acquired pmrD gene product activates the ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in the closely related bacterium Escherichia coli. They found that the Salmonella PmrD protein binds to the phosphorylated PmrA protein ( PmrA-P ), protecting it from dephosphorylation by the PmrB protein, resulting in transcription of PmrA-dependent genes, including those conferring polymyxin B resistance. In contrast, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli, suggesting that the two species differ in an additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. The researchers discovered that the E. coli PmrB protein displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB protein, and identified a PmrB subdomain responsible for this property. Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. These findings demonstrate that quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits, and suggest that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci.
The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is a complex process initiated by the loss of pluripotency-associated transcripts and the induction of differentiation genes. To identify the causal genes that promote or inhibit differentiation, researchers have sought to detect differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation. However, previous methods of identifying differentially expressed genes by comparing different cell types often include a large portion of genes that respond to, rather than regulate, the differentiation process. To address this limitation, a novel statistical approach called the Differentiation-Test was developed to analyze gene expression data obtained without prior separation of cell types. This method assumes that the differentiation process starts from a relatively homogeneous initial cell mixture and progresses into a more heterogeneous cell mixture with identifiable events of divergence of expression levels of certain genes during the process. The Differentiation-Test was applied to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies and identified Smarcad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal. Smarcad1 was experimentally verified using short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to further study its role in differentiation. The Differentiation-Test was formalized as a statistical test that can be generally applied to analyze other differentiation processes. This approach has the potential to identify uncharacterized critical regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal, providing new insights into the complex mechanisms of cellular differentiation.
The article presents a novel method for unbiased functional clustering of gene variants using a phenotypic-linkage network. This approach addresses the issue of confounding bias in coding-sequence length, which can lead to false positive findings in functional studies. The authors demonstrate that genes implicated through de novo sequence variants tend to cluster together due to their longer coding-sequence length, resulting in exaggerated p-values. To control for this bias, the method integrates over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and exploits bio-ontologies through semantic similarity. The phenotypic-linkage network is shown to be superior to other gene networks in identifying functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias. The authors present a tool that can identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease and demonstrate its power to functionally subcluster gene variants underlying a polygenic disorder. The method has been tested with different data types and networks, and the results show that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in the integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. This approach is expected to enhance the interpretation of variants in next-generation sequencing studies and provide a more accurate understanding of the molecular pathways underlying complex diseases.
The Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in January 2014 to combat rising obesity and diabetes rates. This study evaluated the impact of these taxes on household packaged food purchases from January 2012 to December 2014 using data from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services. The analysis included 6,248 households with an average follow-up period of 32.7 months. A longitudinal, fixed-effects model was used to examine changes in the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods, adjusting for pre-existing trends, household characteristics, and contextual factors. The results showed that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 g (95% CI = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what was expected based on pre-tax trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, while medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected. Higher SES households showed no statistically significant change in purchases. These findings suggest that the tax on nonessential energy-dense foods and SSBs led to a decline in the volume of taxed food purchases, with lower SES households being more responsive to the tax. However, the impact of the tax on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns remains to be studied.
The article presents a biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons, specifically the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron (LGMD) of the locust, which exhibits η-like response properties. The model, denoted as n-ψ, assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. By pooling these channels, an approximative power law is obtained, which is a common characteristic of many brain functions. The authors demonstrate that this mechanism can successfully predict many response characteristics of the LGMD neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a collision course. The results show that the model is critically dependent on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The n-ψ model is based on its predecessor model Ψ, which used an exact power law for re-scaling the inhibitory input. However, the n-ψ model is more biophysically plausible and does not require an exact power law. The authors argue that a power law alone is insufficient to explain the LGMD's response properties, and that threshold smoothing, resulting from integrating many inhibitory inputs, is necessary to approximate a power law. The model suggests that the integration process, or pooling, could be carried out by the dendritic tree of the LGMD neuron. The preconditions for each channel are the presence of noise, uncorrelated across channels, and a response threshold. The n-ψ model provides a biophysically plausible explanation for the LGMD's response properties and highlights the importance of noise in the inhibitory pathway.
The National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBUCP) in Cameroon was established in 2002 to combat the disease, which was first reported in the country in 1969. The programme aimed to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all active cases according to standard guidelines, and heal at least 95% of patients without limitation of joint movement. Between 2001 and 2014, 3700 cases of Buruli ulcer (BU) were notified, with the detection rate dropping significantly from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of BU-endemic health districts increased from two to 64, and five diagnostic and treatment centers are now functional, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education on BU have gained more interest in Cameroon. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities by major support partners has led to a steady drop in performance indicators since 2010. The programme's objectives have evolved over time, with the current goal being to reduce the suffering of the population due to BU and ensure accessibility to quality health services in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and disability linked to BU in Cameroon. Despite the progress made, the programme faces the major challenge of resource allocation, which needs to be addressed to improve control activities in the country.
The article investigates the effect of outcome valence on confidence judgments in human reinforcement learning. In two experiments, participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options, necessary to explain equal performance in the gain and loss domain. This biasing effect of context-value on confidence is domain-general and has important functional consequences. One such consequence emerges in volatile environments, where the flexibility of individuals’ learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. The study suggests that profound asymmetries might exist between learning to avoid losses and learning to seek gains, despite apparent similar behavior. The findings have implications for our understanding of the flexibility of learning and decision-making processes in different contexts. The results also highlight the importance of investigating confidence judgments and their biases in reinforcement learning, as they can have critical consequences on learning strategies and decision-making processes. The study contributes to the growing body of research on confidence estimation in decision-making and prediction tasks, and provides new insights into the neural, computational, and behavioral mechanisms underlying confidence judgments in reinforcement learning contexts.
Alphaviruses, a family of positive-strand RNA viruses, have a non-structural protein 3 ( nsP3 ) that plays a crucial role in viral RNA replication. Despite its importance, the function of nsP3 is not well understood. Recent studies have identified a conserved proline-rich sequence motif in the carboxyterminal region of nsP3 that serves as a binding site for the Src-homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of amphiphysin-1 and -2. Amphiphysins are host cell proteins that are involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking. The interaction between nsP3 and amphiphysin is mediated by the PIPPPR motif in nsP3 and the SH3 domains of amphiphysin. This interaction is conserved across different alphaviruses, including Semliki Forest ( SFV ), Sindbis ( SINV ), and Chikungunya viruses. In infected cells, amphiphysin is recruited to the sites of RNA replication and is essential for viral RNA synthesis. Mutations in nsP3 that disrupt the amphiphysin SH3 binding motif or RNAi-mediated silencing of amphiphysin-2 expression resulted in impaired viral RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SFV. Infection of Balb/c mice with SFV carrying an SH3 binding-defective nsP3 was associated with significantly decreased mortality. These findings establish the SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin as an important host cell interaction that promotes alphavirus replication.
This study investigated the molecular epidemiology of chromoblastomycosis, a human disease caused by melanized fungi of the order Chaetothyriales, in Brazil. A total of 123 clinical strains from different endemic areas were analyzed using sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region and partial cell division cycle and β-tubulin genes. The strains were divided into three clusters within the family Herpotrichiellaceae, which is known to comprise agents of the disease. The Fonsecaea cluster contained the most prevalent agents, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi being the most common, accounting for 80% of the strains, followed by Fonsecaea monophora (13%), Fonsecaea nubica (3%), and a single isolate of Fonsecaea pugnacius. Additional agents, including two novel species, were identified in the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the agents of chromoblastomycosis were polyphyletic within the order Chaetothyriales, being dispersed in three different clades: jeanselmei-, bantiana-, and europaea-clades. The study highlights the diversity of agents causing chromoblastomycosis in Brazil and describes two novel species of black fungi causing the disease.
Infection with Listeria monocytogenes induces DNA breaks in host cells and activates the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway. However, surprisingly, the DDR is only moderately activated in response to these breaks. Further investigation revealed that the listerial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a key role in dampening the DDR by degrading the sensor protein Mre11. Mre11 is a crucial component of the DDR pathway, responsible for detecting DNA damage. The degradation of Mre11 by LLO prevents the full activation of the DDR, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to replicate more effectively within the host cell. Consistent with this finding, deletion or inhibition of proteins involved in the DDR leads to increased levels of infection, demonstrating that the DDR acts as a negative regulator of Listeria monocytogenes infection. This study highlights the importance of the DDR in controlling bacterial infection and reveals a novel mechanism by which Listeria monocytogenes subverts the host's DNA damage response to facilitate its own replication. The findings suggest that the DDR is a critical component of the host's defense against Listeria monocytogenes infection, and that LLO-mediated degradation of Mre11 is a key strategy employed by the bacterium to evade the host's immune response.
A chemical library screen of epigenetic regulation identified bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) as a critical player in the replication of human herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). The study found that treatment with pan-BD domain inhibitors, such as JQ1, enhanced both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that JQ1 acts through BRD4, as knockdown of BRD4 expression ablated the effect of JQ1 on HSV infection. BRD4 regulates HSV replication by forming a complex with CDK9 and RNA polymerase II, and JQ1 promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating this complex to HSV gene promoters. Suppression of BRD4 expression or inhibition of CDK9 activity impeded HSV infection. The study demonstrates that BRD4 has an essential role in HSV infection and that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by switching BRD4 to transcription regulation of viral gene expression from chromatin targeting. Transient expression of BRD4 BD1 or BD1/2 domain had a similar effect to that of JQ1 treatment, suggesting that JQ1 promotes HSV infection by diverting BRD4 function due to BD1 blocking. The study also found that BRD4 regulates HSV infection by recruiting transcriptional factors for viral gene expression, and that BD1 inhibitors augment HSV infection by devoting those factors more efficiently to sites of viral gene transcription.
A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the microbial ecology of noma (cancrum oris), a devastating oral disease affecting over 140,000 malnourished children annually. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments from gingival fluid samples was used to catalog bacteria present in noma lesions and identify potential causative agents. The study included 60 samples from 12 healthy children, 12 children with noma (lesion and healthy sites), and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) (lesion and healthy sites). The results showed that noma lesions were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted of Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. In contrast, healthy sites from diseased mouths had similar proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. Fusobacterium was not found to be more abundant in noma mouths, casting doubt on its role as a causative agent. The microbial community in noma lesions was dominated by Prevotella intermedia, which was less abundant in healthy sites from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different. Several bacterial orders, including Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales, were identified as indicators of noma. These findings suggest that one or more microbes within these orders may be associated with the development of noma lesions. Future studies should include longitudinal sampling of viral and microbial components of this community to better understand the etiology of noma.
In Bacillus thuringiensis, quorum sensing plays a crucial role in coordinating adaptation properties, cell fate, and commitment to sporulation. The bacterium's infectious cycle in the insect host serves as a model to investigate the role of quorum sensing in natural conditions. The communication system is regulated by the RNPP family of proteins, including NprR, which acts as a transcription factor in the presence of its cognate signaling peptide NprX. NprR regulates a set of genes involved in the survival of B. thuringiensis in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NprX, NprR negatively controls sporulation by inhibiting the expression of Spo0A-regulated genes. This is achieved by preventing the KinA-dependent phosphorylation of Spo0F, thus delaying the initiation of the sporulation process. The structure of apo NprR reveals a highly flexible Rap-like structure, suggesting a molecular regulatory mechanism where key residues of NprR are directly and alternatively involved in its two functions. The binding of NprX switches NprR from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of B. thuringiensis. This tight coordination of sporulation and necrotrophism ensures the survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection. The NprR-NprX regulation system functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system, where NprX is the signaling peptide. This study reveals unexpected properties of NprR and NprX concerning their role in the developmental program of bacteria belonging to the B. cereus group.
Biomedical researchers have developed a novel approach to predict the efficacy of HIV inhibitors using proteochemometric models. These models combine chemical and protein target properties to improve the accuracy of treatment predictions for individual patients. The study utilized a large-scale clinical database containing over 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points to train the models. The results showed that the proteochemometric models achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Fold Change, outperforming previously published sequence-based models in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change. The models were also able to identify known and previously unpublished resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease. Furthermore, the models were prospectively applied to the public HIV resistance database from Stanford University, achieving a correct resistance prediction rate of 84% on the full set. The study demonstrates the potential of proteochemometric models to accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data, even for novel mutants and mixtures. Additionally, the models provide an applicability domain to inform users about the reliability of predictions. This approach has the potential to improve treatment outcomes for HIV patients by providing a more accurate and personalized treatment regimen. The models can be used to predict the activity of clinical ARV drugs on mutants not present in the dataset, enabling the treatment of patients with new, previously unseen genotypes.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod autocatalysis has been developed to test the explanatory and predictive powers of an alternative mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis. This mechanism proposes that pseudopods are generated by a self-generated cycle, which is modulated by chemoattractants rather than directly causing actin polymerization. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli, selection of accurate pseudopods in the presence of chemoattractant gradients, and bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients, which was experimentally confirmed in Dictyostelium cells. Furthermore, the model predicts that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, which was also experimentally confirmed. The results suggest that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behaviour rather than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. The model's simplicity and robustness to parameter changes emphasize that much of the complex behaviour of cells may be an emergent property derived from relatively simple pathways, implying a need for a change in experimental approach to understand chemotaxis.
The transmission of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, by fleas can occur through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and is influenced by the type of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal. To investigate the effect of host blood on EPT, fleas were fed bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils, and the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis were assessed. The study found that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood frequently regurgitated a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon termed post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER was associated with the accumulation of a dense aggregate of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals in the proventriculus. Fleas with PIER were more likely to appear partially blocked at their next feeding, with fresh blood retained in the esophagus. The study suggests that EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes overlap. The results also indicate that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood may promote regurgitative transmission, which may contribute to the prominence of these rodents in plague ecology.
The article presents a counterintuitive finding that positive correlations among neurons can significantly enhance the fidelity of population codes in the brain. Contrary to previous studies suggesting that correlations are detrimental to coding performance, the authors demonstrate that positive correlations can suppress discrimination errors by several orders of magnitude and increase the capacity of a population to encode stimuli by more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistically high correlation values and can occur in populations with a few tens of neurons. The authors attribute this phenomenon to a specific pattern of correlation that leads to a "lock-in" of response probabilities, eliminating variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. This pattern, referred to as high-fidelity coding, is shown to benefit from heterogeneity in population activity. The authors suggest that this effect is a general feature of population coding and propose experimental tests to identify the specific pattern of correlation responsible for high-fidelity coding. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain represents and processes information, and highlight the importance of considering true population effects when studying neural coding.
A novel cholera conjugate vaccine has been developed using the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (OSP:rTTHc). The vaccine was prepared via squaric acid chemistry and assessed for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. The study evaluated various vaccine formulations, including different doses (10-50 μg), molar loading ratios of OSP to rTTHc (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), the presence or absence of an adjuvant, and different routes of immunization (intramuscular or intradermal). The results showed that immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP were also observed following intradermal vaccination. The study found that the vaccine induced 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. Notably, the vaccine did not induce anti-squarate responses, and memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were blunted in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine (50 μg). The findings suggest that the OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine is a promising candidate for the prevention of cholera, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. The development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high-level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be a significant advancement in cholera control strategies.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting endemicity levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans. The study assessed the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, L. loa, and M. perstans in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain. A total of 2190 individuals participated in the study, with 24 individuals testing positive for ICT, with prevalence rates ranging from 0% in the South-west to 2.1% in the North-west. However, no microfilariae (Mf) of W. bancrofti were found in the night blood of any individual with a positive ICT result or clinical lymphoedema. The study found a strong association between ICT positivity and high L. loa Mf intensity, with 21 subjects having more than 8,000 L. loa Mf/ml of blood. Additionally, a strong positive association was observed between the prevalence of L. loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with an L. loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, no association was found between ICT positivity and M. perstans prevalence or Mf density. The results suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of L. loa, indicating that W. bancrofti may be less prevalent in the Central African region than previously assumed.
The replication of SARS-CoV, a positive-strand RNA virus, occurs in the cytoplasm of infected host cells and is supported by a network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Using electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells, researchers have identified a unique reticulovesicular network that integrates convoluted membranes, double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and "vesicle packets" formed by DMV merger. The convoluted membranes are primarily immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, indicative of viral RNA synthesis, is localized to the interior of DMVs. However, no connection between the DMV interior and the cytosol was observed, raising questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. The study reveals that DMVs are not isolated vesicles but are part of a larger network of modified ER membranes, which also includes convoluted membranes not previously implicated in viral RNA synthesis. This reticulovesicular network is thought to organize viral replication and potentially hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. The findings provide new insights into the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its interactions with host cells. The study's ultrastructural description of the "replication network" will aid in further dissection of the coronavirus life cycle, complementing biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex.
A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has provided direct genetic evidence for the role of suberin in forming an extracellular barrier that affects water relations and mineral nutrition in roots. The enhanced suberin1 (esb1) mutant, characterized by increased root suberin, was found to have reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during its vegetative growth period. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot. Grafting experiments confirmed that these phenotypes were the result of elevated root suberin. The study suggests that suberin acts as a barrier to the extracellular transport of both water and mineral ions in the root. Elevated suberin, as found in esb1, reduces both water movement to the shoot and water loss from the root back to the soil. The results provide strong experimental support for the standard model that suberin acts as an extracellular transport barrier limiting apoplastic radial transport of water and solutes. The study also suggests that elevation of root suberin may represent an approach to developing drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency. Furthermore, the findings indicate that suberin plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves.
The kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation plays a crucial role in regulating the recovery and reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. A Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model, based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, was developed to investigate the dynamics of rhodopsin deactivation. The model was interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction and was able to reproduce both wild-type (WT) and mutant mouse responses with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The model showed that the randomness of the sojourn times in each phosphorylated state contributes to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the response, while the randomness of the number of rhodopsin turnoff steps has a negligible effect. This result contradicts the prevailing view that the larger the number of decay steps of rhodopsin, the more stable the photoresponse is. Instead, the model suggests that rhodopsin shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of second messengers acts as a variability suppressor. The results also indicate that the probability of rhodopsin dissociating without adding another phosphate increases with the number of phosphates present, consistent with in vivo observations. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the reproducibility of the SPR and highlights the importance of rhodopsin deactivation in regulating photoresponse variability.
The article presents a novel mathematical framework for analyzing stochastic reaction networks in fluctuating environments. The framework allows for the uncoupling of the network from its dynamic environment by incorporating only the environment's effect onto the network into a new model. This is achieved through the marginalization of fluctuating extrinsic components, such as chemical species, to obtain a decoupled model. The corresponding process- and master equations are derived, enabling stochastic simulations to be performed. The authors demonstrate the significance of this approach using several case studies. The uncoupled dynamics provide a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated along coupled reaction networks. The total environmental noise is shown to split into two terms: one corresponding to the noise that is suppressed and a second term that quantifies the effective noise sensed by the target network. Additionally, the decoupled process can yield a significant reduction in computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially when the environmental network is costly to simulate. This highlights the role of the provided framework as a general tool to split stochastic biochemical networks into individual parts that are easier to simulate. The framework enables the development of self-contained stochastic models that summarize all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of extrinsic fluctuations.
The article presents a novel closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) training architecture that enables robust control and adaptation using spike events. The architecture, termed adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF), incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control (OFC) model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA), a process termed intention estimation, and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders.

    The authors conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of the novel CLDA components. The results show that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention estimation techniques. OFC-assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared to batch-based methods and was robust to parameter initialization. The architecture also extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training. These results have significant implications for the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics. The proposed architecture provides a unified and general control-theoretic CLDA framework within which intention estimation, assisted training, and adaptation can be performed across diverse BMI setups.
The study investigated the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells to natural and artificial stimuli with varying degrees of correlation. The results show that the retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a wide range of spatio-temporally correlated stimuli, from white noise checkerboards to natural movies. The amount of output correlation varies between stimuli, but the changes are much less than predicted by a non-adapting linear-nonlinear functional model. The retina does not fully decorrelate its input, even for the least correlated white noise checkerboard stimuli, indicating that some correlations are present between pairs of retinal ganglion cell spike trains. The study also found that the gain of retinal ganglion cells responding to correlated stimuli changes with "effective contrast," which is the standard deviation of the input to the nonlinearity in a linear-nonlinear model of ganglion cells. Furthermore, the results suggest that the retina may dynamically adjust its coding strategy to represent the new stimulus class efficiently. The findings are consistent with previous studies that examined pairwise correlations amongst retinal ganglion cell spike trains in specific stimulus conditions. Overall, the study provides new insights into how the retina processes and transforms stimulus correlations, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception.
An integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach has been developed to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, in yeast. SL interactions occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype and are crucial for understanding functional redundancy, dissecting protein complexes, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. However, only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for genetic interactions due to the large number of possible combinations. To address this, the authors devised an approach that combines features from various data sources to characterize the relationships between pairs of genes. These features are independent of known SL interactions, unlike previous approaches. A non-parametric multi-classifier system was developed to predict SL interactions, enabling the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the SL-independent features in conjunction with the advanced classification scheme led to improved performance compared to the current state of the art method. The approach was used to derive the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network and predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast. This integrative approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where very few genetic interactions have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate and interpret variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk associated with these genes. The BRCA Exchange, a newly created website (www.brcaexchange.org), integrates over 20,000 variants, three times the number found in the next-largest public database, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases, population databases, and linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together experts from the international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium, clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers to advance understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes data sharing with national centers, development of methods for extracting genetic variation from individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to understand the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally. The project has developed an open-access web portal, the BRCA Exchange, to improve data sharing and variant classification in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, ultimately improving clinical care for clinicians, patients, and their families.
Malaria, caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To maintain redox regulatory processes and pathogenicity, Plasmodium relies on an adequate redox balance. This study provides the first comprehensive map of redox compartmentation in Plasmodium falciparum by systematically studying the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins. The results show that two plasmodial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system are targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. Additionally, a complete picture of the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins is obtained. Notably, Plasmodium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to achieve differential targeting of the major antioxidant redox-enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. This dual localization of proteins affected by ATI is likely to occur in other Apicomplexa and may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention. The study provides a tool to better understand the cellular functions and interactions of the essential redox network in malaria parasites. Furthermore, it demonstrates the existence of ATI in apicomplexan parasites, which is used to translate protein isoforms with differing subcellular localization from a single gene. The findings offer great potential for the development of chemotherapeutic agents that target the redox equilibrium of Plasmodium.
The study investigated the role of non-native electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding of PUMA, an intrinsically disordered protein, with its cellular partner Mcl-1. Using a structure-based coarse-grained model, the authors probed the importance of electrostatic interactions in the early and later stages of the binding process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity, and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. The results suggest that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a marginal influence on the unbound states of PUMA. However, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, play a significant role in the formation of the initial encounter complex. The study reveals the binding mechanism in more detail than is possible using experimental data alone, and highlights the importance of non-native electrostatic interactions in describing the binding reactions of intrinsically disordered proteins. The findings also suggest that electrostatic interactions can be used to predict the results of mutational studies. The study used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to describe the mechanism of interactions between PUMA and Mcl-1, and found that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions. The association rates decreased at higher ionic strengths, where charges are more efficiently screened from each other and electrostatic interactions weakened.
The study investigated the formation and motion of Polycomb (PC) bodies in Drosophila embryos during early development. PC bodies are nuclear structures that contain Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which maintain the silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, the researchers found that PC bodies correspond to 3D structural counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and Polyhomeotic (PH) proteins progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion influencing the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains: long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories, and fast and highly constrained motions within smaller volumes. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains decreases in late developmental stages, suggesting a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing. The study also found that the motion of PC bodies is less sensitive to temperature than chromatin domains in late embryos, suggesting that Polycomb proteins may buffer environmental effects and contribute to the stability of Polycomb-dependent gene silencing during development.
The study used ultra-deep sequencing to investigate genome-wide mtDNA mutation loads in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. Mice homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase ( mtDNA mutator mice ) had 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. The mtDNA mutator mice also had increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occurred at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and did not drive the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis showed that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings was inherited from their heterozygous mothers, consistent with germline transmission. The study found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. Additionally, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations. The results suggest that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.
A new type of Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane rotor has been identified in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. This enzyme uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The F1Fo-ATP synthase from F. nucleatum contains a novel Na+ recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Activity measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. The Na+ ion has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Two identical crystal structures of the c11 ring were solved by X-ray crystallography at 2. 2 and 2. 6 Å resolution, at pH 5. 3 and 8. 7, respectively. Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen. The c-ring features two glutamate residues in each of its 11 ion-binding sites, instead of a single carboxylate side-chain as is typical. This motif implies that a proton is concurrently bound to all sites, although Na+ alone drives the rotary mechanism.
The study investigated the relationship between T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interactions and T cell responses in vivo. TCR recognition of foreign peptides bound to pMHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) initiates adaptive cellular immunity. In vitro studies have shown that high-affinity binding and long-lived interactions between TCRs and pMHC correlate with high-potency T cell activation. However, the influence of TCR/pMHC interaction parameters on T cell responses in vivo is not well understood. The study tracked CD4+ T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies. Contrary to predictions from in vitro studies, the study found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives. The study observed diminished in vivo responses to the ligand with the longest TCR/pMHC half-life, associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a broad range of time points. These results reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays and highlight the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands in vaccine design. The study suggests that vaccination strategies aiming to elicit maximum-avidity TCR recognition with engineered peptide ligands may warrant reconsideration.
The genome of Nectria haematococca, a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, has been extensively studied. This species is known for its diverse biological properties, including the ability to cause disease in over 100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. The genome of N. haematococca mating population VI (MPVI) consists of 17 chromosomes, ranging in size from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a total physical size of 54.43 Mb. This genome is among the largest reported for ascomycetes, with 15,707 predicted genes. Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion in N. haematococca MPVI: specific genes not found in other fungi, including its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum, and genes present in multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI but as single copies in other fungi. Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed to be absent in some isolates and lacked chromosome-specific sequences found on their ends. These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes. The gene expansion and large genome size of N. haematococca MPVI are consistent with its diverse range of habitats, and the presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches.
To elucidate the cellular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress, a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method was developed to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. The method utilized total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. Single-particle tracking and mean squared displacement analysis revealed that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. Rab GTPases, specifically Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, were found to be present on the virus secretory vesicle and play a key role in the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway. The vesicles underwent fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which was most frequently near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remained tightly confined on the outer cell surface. The study proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress. The findings contradict previous studies and provide new insights into the dynamics and molecular mechanisms of viral egress.
This study investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbiota and host immune response in 109 primary school children. The results showed that pinworm infection was associated with increased intestinal bacterial diversity, which peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment were linked to a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an increased proportion of Actinobacteria. Specifically, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment. Intestinal secretory IgA ( SIgA ) levels were lower in the pinworm-infected group, but elevated in half of the mebendazole-treated group. Notably, a higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment. These findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The gut SIgA level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, but increased in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. The study highlights the complex interactions between pinworm infection, intestinal microbiota, and host immune responses, and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the causal relationships between these factors.
A genome-wide association analysis was conducted to investigate the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana. The study found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for root length in the examined population was statistically zero, indicating a low amount of additive genetic variance that could be captured by the genome-wide genotypes. As a result, no associations to root length could be found using standard additive-model-based genome-wide association ( GWA ) approaches. However, the broad-sense heritability for root length was significantly larger and primarily due to epistasis. An epistatic GWA analysis was performed to map loci contributing to the epistatic genetic variance, revealing four interacting pairs of loci involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps for these pairs showed epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance, explaining why these loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis. The study also estimated the false-positive risk using a new statistical approach, suggesting that half of the associated pairs were true positive associations. Experimental evaluation of candidate genes within the seven associated loci identified functional candidate genes that affected root development in four loci that were part of three of the pairs. The results highlight the importance of accounting for epistatic interactions in GWA analyses to detect contributing loci for complex traits.
The study analyzed 30,506 human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to investigate the relationship between background mtDNA haplogroups and the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations. The results showed that the mean pathogenicity score for known disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA macro-haplogroups. Several mutations were observed across all haplogroup backgrounds, while others were only observed on specific clades. The study found that disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences and that genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. These findings suggest that the mtDNA background plays a role in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations. The study also found that the frequency of disease-causing mutations was lower in macro-haplogroup N sequences, indicating that the mtDNA sequence background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining a disease-causing mutation. The analysis of 57 disease-causing mutations on major haplogroups revealed that 10 (29.4%) showed statistical evidence of haplogroup clustering, suggesting that some disease-causing mutations may be rare sub-haplogroup markers rather than directly pathogenic. Overall, the study provides evidence that background mtDNA haplogroups are associated with the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations.
The article presents a computational phase field model of collective cell motility that includes the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model is used to study the interactions between cells migrating on micropatterned substrates, which restrict cell migration to linear, quasi-one-dimensional paths. The model is able to reproduce all possible outcomes of two-cell collisions, including cells reversing direction, sticking to each other, or walking past each other. The results show that a subtle balance between internal cell polarization, CIL, and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. The model identifies the parameters that control transitions between the different cases, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior and the effect of interventions that modulate collision outcomes. To reproduce the heterogeneity in cell-cell collision outcomes observed experimentally in neural crest cells, the model must either carefully tune its parameters or assume significant cell-to-cell variation in key parameters like cell-cell adhesion. The study highlights the importance of complementing minimal models of cells as self-propelled particles with increasingly detailed models for cell shape and mechanics. The results show that the coupling of detailed cell shape dynamics with biochemistry can lead to unintuitive behaviors, such as nonmonotonic effects of adhesion. The model can reproduce the four distinct phenotypes of cell-cell collisions observed in neural crest cells and healthy and metastatic epithelial cells.
The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes has been a topic of debate for over twenty years. To elucidate this process, the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC), was used as a model system. Theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants were employed to study Trx mixed disulfide dissociation. The results showed that conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. Cys32Trx was found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directed its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx rather than Cys89ArsC. This study provides new insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism, resulting in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. The findings suggest that the nucleophilic attack of Cys32Trx on Cys29Trx is the favored reaction in the dissociation of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex. This mechanism is supported by the stabilization of Cys29Trx as a thiolate through hydrogen bonds in the active site of reduced Trx. The results have implications for understanding the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic attack of Cys29Trx on the Cys82ArsC-Cys89ArsC disulfide.
This study investigated how people use social information to learn about their own preferences, specifically in the context of inter-temporal preferences. The researchers proposed that personal tastes are not fixed personality characteristics, but rather uncertain beliefs that can be updated based on evidence, such as the preferences of others. They developed a taste-uncertainty (KU) model, which assumes that individuals maintain and update a distribution over their own taste and sample from it to make choices. The study tested this model in a large community study of 14-24 year olds, examining their discounting preferences, including decision variability, before and after observing another person's choices. The results provided evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian taste updating. Participants displayed decision variability that was better accounted for by a random-taste than by a response-noise model, and apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model taking into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. The findings suggest that uncertainty about one's own preferences, reflected in behavioral variability in the absence of social influence, is an important basis for a subsequent preference shift. The study's results have implications for neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental research. The KU model provided a good fit to the data, and the dependence of preference-shift on choice variability and the decrease in taste uncertainty with age suggest that choice variability substantially reflects uncertain taste rather than just 'trembling hand' or taste-independent response noise.
In budding yeast, the process of filamentous growth, a complex differentiation response, is regulated by multiple pathways. A novel screening approach called secretion profiling was used to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, the signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. This approach revealed that many pathways that regulate filamentous growth, including RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG, are also required for FG pathway activation. The regulation of these pathways sensitized the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronized it with the global signaling network. Several regulators were found to be necessary for MSB2 expression, identifying the MSB2 promoter as a target "hub" where multiple signals converge. The histone deacetylase Rpd3p(L) was found to positively regulate FG pathway activity and filamentous growth by controlling accessibility to the MSB2 promoter. These findings provide the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth. The study suggests that systems-level integration of signaling circuitry coordinates other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors. The connections between the RIM101, OPI1, and RTG pathways to FG pathway regulation are entirely novel, and the RAS pathway and several other pathways converge on the promoter of the key upstream regulator MSB2 of the FG pathway. This suggests a systems-level coordination between the pathways that regulate filamentous growth.
The study investigated the role of gene expression changes in the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the Sordariomycetes. The researchers cultured five species in a common garden environment and profiled genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. By reconstructing ancestral gene expression phenotypes, they identified genes with the largest evolved increases in expression across development. Knockout experiments in two divergent species showed altered fruiting body development in the species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than other gene deletion studies targeting whole genomes or gene families. The study also refined Bayesian networks of genes underlying fruiting body development, a poorly understood process in multicellular development. The results suggest that few developmental genes retain common phenotypes or stages of development, but numerous genes retain some function within the larger fruiting body developmental process. The study provides insights into the common and divergent developmental sources of homologous phenotypes and how novelty arises despite the constraints of extant gene interaction networks. By combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes, the researchers were able to build a more rigorous understanding of the relationships among genes important to fruiting body development and how those relationships evolved. Estimation of gene expression phenotypes in ancestral lineages provides a means of identifying putative changes in gene expression that may be key to morphological and adaptive innovation.
The study investigated the use of square wave electroporation to introduce transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis. The researchers found that electroporation facilitated the introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into the eggs, resulting in higher transduction efficiency compared to soaking the eggs in the macromolecules alone. The study demonstrated that electroporation enabled the delivery of fluorescent short-interference RNA ( siRNA ), messenger RNA ( mRNA ) encoding firefly luciferase, and pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) virions into the eggs. The results showed that electroporation increased the copy number of proviral transgenes in miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs by 2-3 times compared to soaking alone. Additionally, the study found that electroporation of capped mRNA encoding luciferase resulted in detectable luciferase activity in eggs three hours after electroporation, whereas soaking alone did not. The findings suggest that square wave electroporation is a useful tool for introducing transgenes into the schistosome egg, which is an attractive target for germ line transgenesis due to the high ratio of germ to somatic cells. The study highlights the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for transgenesis, which could lead to the development of new strategies for controlling schistosomiasis.
A novel approach called Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model has been developed to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. This model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation and assuming that perturbations are transmitted through a Markovian process through the connected network defined by atomic and residue contacts. The PMT model enables the simultaneous monitoring of time-dependent responses of all residues from the moment of perturbation until equilibrium is reached, providing rich information on the dynamic behavior of the assembly. The model can also be modified to study signal transmission pathways by applying initial perturbation to restricted local regions, such as binding surfaces. This approach is particularly effective for very large macromolecular assemblies, requiring relatively small computational time. The PMT model was applied to the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, a large macromolecular assembly, and the results showed an accuracy of 71-84% when compared to independent experimental studies. The model identified pivot residues important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediation, and anchor residues crucial for binding interactions. The PMT model is a general approach that can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries, such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.
Caenorhabditis elegans N-glycan Core β-galactoside Confers Sensitivity towards Nematotoxic Fungal Galectin CGL2
    Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes fed with the mushroom galectin Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2 exhibited inhibited development, reproduction, and ultimately death. The nematotoxicity of CGL2 was dependent on its interaction with a fucose-containing glycoconjugate. A screen for CGL2-resistant worm mutants identified the glycoconjugate as a Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores. Analysis of N-glycan structures in wild-type and CGL2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and led to the identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope. The X-ray crystal structure of a complex between CGL2 and the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6GlcNAc trisaccharide at 1.5 Å resolution revealed the biophysical basis for this interaction. The results suggest that fungal galectins play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms. The identified ligand of CGL2 in C. elegans, Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of the proximal GlcNAc of N-glycan cores, was originally discovered as a feature of octopus and squid rhodopsin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The physiological significance of this N-glycan modification is unknown, and the identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for this modification may shed light on its distribution and function.
The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV. However, the effect of these reservoirs on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus has received little attention. This study presents a within-host quasispecies model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nests it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. The results show that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay evolutionary dynamics within a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. The study finds that the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads consistent with maximizing transmission, rather than the very high viral loads predicted by previous models. This effect can be further enhanced if viruses similar to those that initiate infection are preferentially transmitted. The results depend strongly on within-host characteristics, such as the relative reservoir size, and the evolution of intermediate viral loads is observed only when the within-host dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The study concludes that the latent reservoir has important roles in both within- and between-host viral evolution.
This study investigated the mechanisms by which coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) evades the host T cell response. Using transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors, the researchers evaluated antigen presentation by CVB3 in vitro and in vivo. The results show that CVB3 almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC class I pathway, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. In contrast, the presentation of CVB3-encoded MHC class II epitopes is relatively unencumbered, and CVB3 induces in vivo CD4+ T cell responses that are phenotypically normal. The CD4+ T cells display an effector phenotype, mature into multi-functional CVB3-specific memory cells, and expand dramatically following challenge infection. These findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsackievirus infection. The study used recombinant CVB3 encoding well-characterized CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cell epitopes from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to assess antigen presentation in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrate that CVB3 profoundly inhibits the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, providing a plausible explanation for the weakness of the primary CD8+ T cell response. In contrast, MHC class II presentation is relatively uninterrupted, and CVB3 induces both primary and memory CD4+ T cell responses.
A Phase 2 randomised controlled double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in combination with oral prednisolone versus oral prednisolone alone in individuals with leprosy Type 1 reactions (T1Rs) and/or nerve function impairment (NFI). Forty-two participants were randomised to receive either three days of high-dose intravenous MP (1g) followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. The results showed no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. However, individuals treated with MP were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study compared to those treated with prednisolone alone. The study also found that 50% of participants required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. The findings suggest that prolonged courses of corticosteroids may be necessary to treat T1Rs and NFI, and highlight the need to investigate risk factors for recurrence during and after corticosteroid treatment. The study did not demonstrate a larger therapeutic effect of MP compared to prednisolone alone on symptoms and signs of leprosy T1Rs and NFI.
The study investigated the effects of regulatory CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells (Treg) on CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. In contrast to Treg from HIV-negative controls, Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV+) did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, suggesting a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. However, Treg/HIV+ inhibited the IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. In cross-over cultures, Treg/HIV- inhibited the differentiation of either CEF- or Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on Gag-specific CD8+ T cells compared to CEF-specific CD8+ T cells, and the expression of these markers did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-, unlike on CEF-specific CD8+ T cells. The results suggest that Treg/HIV+ have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which might contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses. The study also found that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were less sensitive to the suppressive effects of Treg compared to other recall antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
The present study evaluated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. The GST gene was cloned from the third-stage larval cDNA library of W. bancrofti and recombinant GST (rWbGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for their reactivity with rWbGST, revealing significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies in sera from endemic normal individuals compared to those who were microfilaraemic or showed symptoms of clinical pathology. Isotype analysis showed a predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies in endemic normal individuals. Functional analysis demonstrated that the rWbGST protein retained enzymatic activity and the antibodies in endemic normal sera could inhibit this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-rWbGST antibodies raised in mice. Brugia malayi GST and WbGST showed significant sequence similarity, and vaccination studies in a jird model showed that approximately 61% protection could be achieved against a B. malayi L3 challenge infection in jirds immunized with rWbGST. These findings suggest that rWbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. The study also showed that the WbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST, which appears to be critical for the survival of the parasite in the host. These results support the potential of WbGST as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.
Title: No Unexpected CRISPR-Cas9 Off-Target Activity Revealed by Trio Sequencing of Gene-Edited Mice
    Abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have transformed genome-editing of experimental organisms and have immense therapeutic potential. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, concerns remain over the potential for off-target effects. Recent studies have addressed these concerns using whole-genome sequencing ( WGS ) of gene-edited embryos or animals to search for de novo mutations ( DNMs ), which may represent candidate changes introduced by poor editing fidelity. Critically, these studies used strain-matched, but not pedigree-matched controls and thus were unable to reliably distinguish generational or colony-related differences from true DNMs. Here we used a trio design and whole genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenised with well-characterised gRNAs targeting the coat colour Tyrosinase ( Tyr ) locus. Detailed analyses of these whole genome data allowed us to conclude that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, then the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. Supporting Text: We conclude that if CRISPR mutagenesis performed under the conditions we have described were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, then the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes.

Despite significant advances in our understanding of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, concerns remain over the potential for off-target effects. Importantly, to ensure our experiment was representative of the many thousands of CRISPR experiments performed worldwide, including those of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, we compared these data to MiSeq data from 324 mice mutagenized using the Tyr2R gRNA, revealing good concordance of targeting efficiency and mosaicism ( S3 Table ).
The regulation of stomatal aperture in plants is crucial for photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and agricultural crop yields. Blue light is one of the environmental signals that regulate stomatal aperture, and the signal transduction cascades linking light perception to stomatal opening response are still largely unknown. This study identifies two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), in the control of stomatal aperture. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in guard cells in response to light-to-dark or dark-to-light transitions. HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1. In the dark, HRB1 is mostly dephosphorylated in a protein complex of 193 kDa, and blue light increases the complex size to 285 kDa. In the pp7 mutant, this size shift is impaired, and HRB1 is predominantly phosphorylated. The study proposes that modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential to acquire a proper conformation or to bring in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. These findings may provide strategies for plants to enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. MDT-15 is a component of the Mediator complex, a multisubunit complex that interacts with transcriptional regulatory factors to modulate gene expression. In C. elegans, MDT-15 has been shown to integrate the regulatory actions of the sterol response element binding protein SBP-1 and the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 on fatty acid metabolism. This study demonstrates that MDT-15 has a broader spectrum of activities and is involved in integrating metabolic responses to ingested materials, including xenobiotics and heavy metals. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene abrogated the induction of specific detoxification genes in response to certain toxins, rendering the animals hypersensitive to toxin exposure. MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, but not other stress responses such as thermotolerance. The study suggests that MDT-15 integrates several transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. The findings propose a model in which MDT-15 coordinates systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring maintenance of health and longevity. MDT-15 has been shown to interact with at least two metabolic regulatory factors, NHR-49 and SBP-1, and its functional defects did not abrogate other stress responses. The study also suggests that MDT-15 may integrate the transcriptional response to environmental stressors such as xenobiotics and heavy metals by employing a different set of regulatory factors.
The article presents a topological paradigm for hippocampal spatial map formation based on persistent homology theory in algebraic topology. The authors hypothesize that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and that a map encoded by co-firing will be based on connectivity and adjacency, i. e., it will be a topological map. To test this hypothesis, a simple model of hippocampal activity was simulated using computer simulations of rat trajectories in three topologically and geometrically distinct test environments. The simulations varied three parameters : firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons. A computational algorithm based on persistent homology theory was used to analyze the patterns of neuronal co-firing. The results show that the patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. The simulations also reveal a “learning region” that highlights the interplay between the parameters in combining to produce hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. The authors propose that this learning region provides a theoretical lens through which to view conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity. The study suggests that a topological connectivity map can be effectively and reliably derived from neuronal spiking patterns using computational tools from algebraic topology.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) production involves the assembly of virions on or near lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in association with components of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. An RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion and live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking were used to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. The RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. The results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. Live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking using an infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein (TC-core) revealed that TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and localizes to the Golgi and recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells. The results suggest that HCV virions egress through the secretory pathway from the TGN to recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane.
This study investigated the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of the Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. NF1 heterozygous mice were mutagenized to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms, and expression analysis of tumor cell lines identified Grb10 as widely absent. Polymorphism analysis revealed that the expressed allele of Grb10 was commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors. Functional studies showed that restoring Grb10 in Nf1 mutant tumors decreased proliferation, colony formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, Grb10 silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts increased cell proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of a constitutively activated MEK rescued tumor cells from Grb10-mediated reduction in colony formation. In tumors, Grb10 loss independently promoted Ras pathway hyperactivation, leading to hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. These findings demonstrate a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis and suggest that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin. The study also identified Grb10 as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, contributing to Ras dysregulation in Nf1-mediated tumorigenesis. The results have implications for understanding the types of tumors that can arise after Grb10 loss and suggest that Grb10 loss may have tumor-promoting consequences in other oncogenic contexts.
The study investigated the neural mechanisms of Pavlovian fear conditioning in humans by examining autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to conditioned stimuli. Pavlovian fear conditioning is an aversive learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an aversive event, leading to the prediction of threat from environmental cues. However, the computational understanding of this process is fragmented, with different models giving rise to opposing predictions for the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning. To address this, the study employed a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses. The study considered previously proposed non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, as well as different observation functions to link learning models with ANS activity. The results showed that a probabilistic learning model best explained ANS responses, with skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size responses (PSR) reflecting different quantities of the same model. SCR tracked a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR tracked expected outcome alone. The study provides systematic evidence that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.
In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a new suppressor of the Cdc7p/SepH kinase, PomA, has been identified as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation. The septation initiation network ( SIN ), composed of a conserved SepH kinase cascade, plays a crucial role in fungal cytokinesis and asexual reproduction. The mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway, which depends on successive signaling cascade phosphorylation to sense and respond to stress and environmental factors, is also involved in septation and conidiation. PomA, a putative protein kinase, localizes to the spindle pole body-like pattern and the tips of hyphal cells, and its deletion cures defects of septation and conidiation in the sepH1 mutant. Overexpression of PomA abolishes septation and conidiation. SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of MAPK-HogA, while PomA reversely affects this process. The phosphorylation of HogA induced by osmotic stress bypasses the requirement of SepH to fulfill septation and conidiation. The findings demonstrate that crosstalk exists between the SIN and MAPK pathways, and PomA and SepH indirectly regulate HogA phosphorylation through affecting HogA-P upstream kinases. The study suggests that SepH and PomA coordinately regulate the phosphorylation of HogA, playing a key role in septation and conidiation. The results also imply that the phosphorylated activation of MAPK may play important roles in septation and conidiation.
The present study investigated the association between the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and the mucosal manifestations of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients from Rondonia, Brazil. The patients were diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), concomitant CL and ML, disseminated leishmaniasis (DL), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) based on clinical and molecular diagnoses. The study found that LRV1 was detected in 71.1% of mucosal lesions and 36.7% of cutaneous lesions. The presence of LRV1 was significantly associated with the occurrence of mucosal leishmaniasis, with a ratio of 2.93 (95% CI 1.57-5.46, p < 0.001). The study also identified five Leishmania species: Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, Leishmania (V.) guyanensis, Leishmania (V.) lainsoni, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, and Leishmania (V.) shawi. The most frequent species was L. braziliensis, detected in 121 cases (77.6%). LRV1 was detected in L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. amazonensis, L. lainsoni, and inconclusive samples. The study suggests that LRV1 is an important factor associated with the severity of mucosal leishmaniasis, but it is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The findings provide new evidence on the relationship between LRV1 and the different species of Leishmania with the clinical manifestations of TL.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumococcal invasive disease by inhibiting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the bloodstream. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. In contrast, treatment of mice with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)) dramatically reduced the development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. IFNβ treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet activating factor receptor (PAF receptor). IFN-I reduced pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar1−/− mice showed overall enhanced lung permeability. These findings identify IFN-I as an important component of the host immune defense that regulates two mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion: PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration. Ultimately, IFN-I limits the progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease by controlling the transition of pneumococci from the lung into the bloodstream.
The study presents a multi-layer neural network that utilizes rewarded and non-rewarded spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP) to learn a complex foraging task. The network consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer employs non-rewarded STDP, allowing neurons to respond to specific combinations of inputs and perform basic pattern classification. The output layer, which implements rewarded STDP, enables the network to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled training data. Synaptic noise facilitates trial-and-error learning, enabling the network to identify effective goal-oriented strategies. The study demonstrates that the combination of rewarded and non-rewarded STDP, along with homeostatic regulation mechanisms such as heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, and activity normalization, is sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision-making. The results show that the multi-layered network outperforms previous models with a single plastic layer based on rewarded STDP. The study highlights the advantages of combining different plasticity mechanisms to achieve high learning performance in discrimination and decision-making tasks. The network's ability to learn and solve complex tasks without labeled training data suggests potential applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The study's findings provide insights into the properties of spiking neuronal networks with STDP that are sufficient to solve complex tasks.
The ETS transcription factor ELF5 has been identified as a key driver of lung metastasis in luminal breast cancer through the recruitment of Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In the mouse mammary tumor virus-Polyoma Middle T (MMTV-PyMT) model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF5 levels increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, leading to a significant increase in the size and number of lung metastases. MDSCs, a group of immature neutrophils, were found to be recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5 and played a crucial role in vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs using specific Ly6G antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, expression signatures in luminal A breast cancers indicated that increased MDSC invasion and inflammation were correlated with ELF5 expression, and increased ELF5 immunohistochemical staining predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of luminal A patients. In the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, increased ELF5 levels drove metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. These findings implicate ELF5 as a defining factor in the acquisition of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer, particularly in the development of antiestrogen resistance. The results also suggest that ELF5 expression produces a similar response in human luminal A breast cancer to that observed in the ELF5-driven mouse PyMT model.
The interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Recent experiments have shown that the connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form of chromatin loops influence gene expression. However, the effect of these factors on cell-to-cell variability in gene expression remains poorly understood. To address this issue, a stochastic model was developed to map the connection patterns between interacting DNA loops into a multistate model of gene expression. The model takes into account the rates of chromatin looping, which depend on the distance between regulatory elements and the distances between other pairs of regulatory elements. The results show that the complexity of transcription activation is mainly due to the ordered interactions among regulatory elements, including the formation of DNA loops and interactions between DNA loops. In the absence of communication form, nested loops promote gene expression but reduce expression noise, while alternating loops reduce the mean expression level but enlarge the noise compared to side-by-side loops. The study also found that facilitated tracking and direct looping have different effects on gene expression, with facilitated tracking performing better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise. However, this control or tuning is distance-dependent, and there is a limit loop length where the difference in effect between the two communication forms almost disappears. The analysis and results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.
Metabolic engineering relies heavily on RNA technology to rewire metabolism and maximize production. However, the development of pure riboregulators, which repress gene expression without the need for a coexpressed protein, is hindered by the lack of clear design principles. To address this, researchers developed translation inhibiting RNAs ( tiRNAs ) from scratch to explore the feature space of repressing riboregulators. Twelve structural and thermodynamic features were defined, and six were retained after removing correlations from an in silico generated riboregulator library. Eighteen riboregulators were selected and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality. The resulting pure riboregulators showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels. A partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of tiRNAs to gene repression, indicating that both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient gene repression. This approach enables a more reliable de novo forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, expanding the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation. The study provides a framework for the de novo design of pure riboregulators and highlights the importance of considering both structural and thermodynamic features in their development.
The article presents a study on the phenomenon of coherence potentials in the cortex, which are transient associations among neurons that underlie memory and behavior. The researchers recorded local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. They found that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, called coherence potentials, extend up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information, similar to action potentials at the single-cell level. Coherence potentials have an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, providing a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allowing identification of particular associations. The study suggests that coherence potential propagation reflects a preservation of the temporal characteristics of the underlying neuronal activity, and that temporal properties of the LFP waveform often serve as better predictors of behaviors than spikes. The researchers propose that coherence potential propagation in vivo represents the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network, analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
A systematic genetic screen of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been conducted to identify essential factors involved in nuclear size control. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which nuclear size correlates with cell size. A total of 25 essential factors were identified that alter nuclear size, and bioinformatic analyses implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in nuclear size control. The screen revealed a 35-fold range of cell volumes, with a constant nuclear volume to cell volume (N/C) ratio across this range. In small-scale pilot experiments, nuclear volume increased steadily with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant N/C ratio throughout interphase. The results suggest that both the regulation of global cellular processes, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis, and the regulation of specific structural components of the nucleus are important for nuclear size control. In multicellular organisms, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio is generally restricted to a narrow range for cells of each type, and nuclear volume correlates with cell volume across a wide range of cell sizes in both budding and fission yeasts. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear size control and highlight the importance of RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET). Traditional DBS involves delivering a constant frequency train of pulses via electrodes implanted in the brain. New ‘closed-loop’ approaches aim to improve efficiency, efficacy, and reduce side effects by delivering stimulation based on ongoing symptoms or brain activity. A key challenge is devising a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with motor disorders. To address this, a reduced coupled oscillator model was used to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. The model, based on the Kuramoto model, analyzed how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. The results predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and that stimulation should have a greater effect when applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. These predictions were compared with data from ET patients and a new hybrid strategy was proposed, combining phase-locked and adaptive DBS. The phase-dependent effects of stimulation predicted by the coupled-oscillator model have been shown to generalize to other models and have been observed in a biologically realistic model of a neural circuit generating oscillations related to Parkinson’s disease. However, these predictions have not been directly compared with the experimental effects of closed-loop DBS.
A new rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, named Biompha-LAMP, has been developed and evaluated for detecting Schistosoma mansoni in Biomphalaria glabrata snails, the intermediate host of the parasite. The LAMP assay targets a sequence of the S. mansoni ribosomal intergenic spacer 28S-18S rRNA and has a detection limit of 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay was evaluated using experimentally infected snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure, including the early prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. DNA for LAMP assays was obtained using a commercial DNA extraction kit or a simple heat NaOH extraction method. The Biompha-LAMP assay was found to be specific, sensitive, and rapid, with the ability to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails without requiring complicated DNA extraction procedures. The assay is potentially adaptable as a cost-effective method for screening intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. The Biompha-LAMP assay could be suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas. The development of this assay addresses an important point in snail control interventions related to schistosomiasis elimination, which is the need for inexpensive, field-applicable diagnostic assays for large-scale screening of individual or pooled snails from transmission sites to detect the presence of schistosomes.
This study aimed to estimate the public sector costs of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most heavily urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during the 2012 epidemic year. From the Ministry of Health's perspective, the total cost of dengue control and hospitalizations was estimated at US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita) in Colombo district. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of the total costs of dengue control activities (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The per capita cost of dengue control activities was US$0.42. The average costs per hospitalization ranged from US$216 to US$609 for pediatric cases and US$196 to US$866 for adult cases, depending on disease severity and treatment setting. This analysis is the first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka. The results suggest that dengue poses a significant economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka. The study highlights the substantial resources used for dengue prevention and hospital care services, which represent an opportunity cost that can be reallocated to other health services. The estimated US$0.42 per capita cost of dengue prevention and control in Colombo corresponds to a monthly cost of US$0.03 per capita.
A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for European Paternal Lineages

    The origins of European paternal lineages have been a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting a Paleolithic origin and others proposing a Neolithic origin. A recent study has reevaluated the history of haplogroup R1b1b2 (R-M269), the most common European Y-chromosomal lineage, carried by approximately 110 million European men. The study found that the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity within this haplogroup is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This contradicts previous studies that suggested a Paleolithic origin based on the haplogroup's high frequency in Western Europe.

    The study's findings indicate that most European Y chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion, making Europe a prime example of how technological and cultural change is linked with the expansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage. This pattern contrasts with the origins of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, which suggests a unique role for males in the transition. Other European haplogroups, such as E1b1b1 (E-M35) and J, also show evidence of Neolithic expansion. The study's results suggest that the great majority of European Y chromosomes have their origins in the Neolithic expansion.
The relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning has been a topic of interest in the field of motor control. Recent studies have suggested that increased movement variability may enhance motor learning, but a computational model of motor adaptation reveals that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning. The model simulations show that increased variability does not necessarily lead to faster learning and may even slow it down in some cases. A meta-analysis of published papers found no statistical correlation between movement variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. The authors propose that the relationship between motor variability and learning rate may be task-specific and dependent on the factors that predominantly affect task performance. Computer simulations of error-based learning using an optimal learner model support this hypothesis, suggesting that the relationship between variability and learning rate can vary widely in motor adaptation. The results of four experiments conducted by the authors are qualitatively explained by taking into account sensory uncertainty or observation noise. The study by Wu et al. found that initial variability can predict the learning rate in both reinforcement learning tasks and motor adaptation tasks, providing evidence for a facilitatory effect of error-based motor adaptation. Overall, the findings suggest that motor variability is a complex factor that can have both positive and negative effects on motor learning, and further research is needed to understand the relative importance of the involved factors.
The RelA:CBP/p300 interaction plays a crucial role in NF-κB-driven transcription by regulating the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, survival, and proliferation. RelA, a prominent NF-κB family member, interacts with CBP/p300 in a bipartite manner, with the DNA binding domain of RelA binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 and the transcriptional activation domain ( TAD ) of RelA binding to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event at Ser276 of RelA is necessary for the former interaction to occur. The structure of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of the RelA:CBP/p300 complex was determined by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the folding of RelA–TA2 upon binding to TAZ1 through well-conserved hydrophobic sites. Mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Studies using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a major set of RelA-activated genes is affected by this interaction. The RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through a negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway. Chromatin analyses revealed constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300 to RelA target gene promoters, suggesting a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruiting RelA to its target promoter sites. Disrupting the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction disturbed the temporal profile of nuclear activity of RelA and deregulated the expression of a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes.
The article introduces Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA), a method for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data using predefined groups of genes. TcGSA is an extension of gene set analysis, which has been successfully applied in cross-sectional studies. The proposed method relies on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates, allowing for the use of all available repeated measurements while handling unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TcGSA is a hypothesis-driven approach that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When comparing biological conditions, the method indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. TcGSA was applied to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial) and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. The results showed that TcGSA revealed significant changes in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination, whereas standard univariate individual gene analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series failed to detect any significant pattern change. TcGSA also identified 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine, which were previously associated with the pneumococcal vaccine. A simulation study demonstrated the good statistical properties and increased power of TcGSA compared to other approaches. The method is made available for the community through an R package.
The spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite, have been poorly understood compared to Plasmodium falciparum. To address this knowledge gap, a systematic effort was undertaken to map the global endemicity of P. vivax in 2010. A spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach was used to estimate endemicity age-standardised to the 1–99 year age range (PvPR1–99) within every 5×5 km resolution grid square. The model incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa. The results show that endemicity was predicted within a relatively narrow range throughout the endemic world, with the point estimate rarely exceeding 7% PvPR1–99. The Americas contributed 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas were generally sparsely populated and the region contributed only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR) globally. In Africa, Duffy negativity constrained stable transmission to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of global PAR. Central Asia was home to 82% of global PAR, with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contained areas of the highest endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and contributed 9% of global PAR. The study provides a detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity, intended to contribute to a paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination.
Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that causes skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and expresses several cell wall-anchored proteins that contribute to its virulence. Clumping factor B (ClfB) is one of these proteins, previously shown to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonization by binding to host ligands loricrin and cytokeratin 10 in the anterior nares. However, the role of ClfB in SSTIs has not been investigated until now. This study reveals that ClfB plays a crucial role in determining the structure and bacterial burden of skin abscesses during S. aureus infection. The interaction between ClfB and loricrin, a protein expressed within the abscess tissue, is essential for this process. Targeting ClfB with a model vaccine that induces both humoral and cellular responses leads to protection against S. aureus skin infection. These findings identify ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines. The study demonstrates that ClfB is not only involved in nasal colonization but also in the pathogenesis of SSTIs, likely exerting its effect early in the infection process. The interaction between ClfB and loricrin appears to be specific to the skin, as no difference was observed in systemic S. aureus SSTIs. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ClfB as a vaccine target for preventing S. aureus SSTIs.
To achieve the 90-90-90 goals set by UNAIDS, a hybrid stochastic framework was developed to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV. The framework integrates pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, as well as viral characteristics, to a priori assess prophylactic strategies. As an example, the framework was applied to dolutegravir (DTG), a second-generation integrase inhibitor, to predict its efficacy in PrEP, PrEP "on demand," and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The simulations showed that once-daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% of infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP "on demand" prevented 79-84% of infections, and PEP >80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. The predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide the release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations. The framework can be easily adapted to other PrEP candidates, and the simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. The results suggest that initiating prophylaxis earlier has a more pronounced effect than prolonging PEP, arguing for the immediate start of PEP in case of known- or suspected HIV exposure. The hybrid stochastic framework provides a tool for the intelligent design of once-daily, episodic PrEP, as well as simulating the on- and offset of event-driven PrEP or long-acting injectable PrEP formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy to enhance its replication. However, the mechanisms by which HCV regulates the autophagic pathway remain unclear. This study investigated the role of Rubicon and UVRAG, two proteins involved in autophagy, in HCV replication. The results demonstrated that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which have opposing effects on autophagosome maturation. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, leading to their accumulation in the early stages of infection, while UVRAG stimulates their maturation. The induction of Rubicon is prompt, whereas the induction of UVRAG is delayed, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early time points of HCV infection. The role of Rubicon in inhibiting autophagosome maturation was confirmed by siRNA knockdown and over-expression experiments, which showed that suppression of Rubicon reduced HCV replication and its over-expression enhanced HCV replication. In contrast, over-expression of UVRAG facilitated autophagosome maturation and suppressed HCV replication. The study also found that the HCV NS4B protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. The results suggest that HCV differentially regulates the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to temporally regulate autophagic flux and enhance its replication.
Cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, plays a crucial role in regulating spermatogenesis in mice. CCNYL1 is highly expressed in the testis and is approximately seven times more abundant than its homologue, Cyclin Y (CCNY). Male mice lacking CCNYL1 (Ccnyl1-/-) are infertile, whereas mice lacking CCNY (Ccny-/-) display normal fertility. Spermatozoa from Ccnyl1-/- mice exhibit impaired motility and structural defects, including a thinned annulus region and/or a bent head. In contrast, mice lacking CDK16, a cyclin-dependent kinase, display a similar phenotype to Ccnyl1-/- mice. CCNYL1 interacts with CDK16, increasing the stability and kinase activity of the complex. The interaction also alters the phosphorylation levels of CDK16, with several phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal region of CDK16 being essential for CCNYL1 binding and modulation of CDK16 kinase activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of CCNYL1 in regulating spermatogenesis through its interaction with CDK16. The CCNYL1 and CDK16 protein complex is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice, suggesting that CCNYL1 may be an ideal molecule for a male contraceptive or for the development of drugs that specifically inhibit CCNYL1 expression or CCNYL1/CDK16 activity.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly), a virulence factor, exists in two forms: free and associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). While the free toxin is lytic towards human endothelium, the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells are unknown. This study investigated the effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. The results show that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse these cells but triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked to endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly escapes from the lysosomes and targets mitochondria, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptotic cell death. This study reveals a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases, where OMV-mediated intracellular delivery allows the toxin to target mitochondria. The findings suggest that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly irreversibly injures human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, which are key players in the pathogenesis of EHEC-mediated diseases.
In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a positive feedback loop exists between histone H2B ubiquitylation ( H2Bub1 ) and the positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb/Cdk9 ) to regulate transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ). H2Bub1 promotes site-specific methylation of histone H3 by the methyltransferase Set1, and also regulates gene expression through a methylation-independent mechanism. Chemical and genetic analyses indicate that lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate Spt5 reduces H2Bub1 levels in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. An Spt5 phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of Set1 phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2Bub1 loss, suggesting independent, partially redundant roles for Cdk9 and Set1 downstream of H2Bub1. Genome-wide analyses by chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate opposing effects of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 on distribution of transcribing RNAPII. The results imply that other pathways can modulate the functions of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 in transcript elongation, and suggest that P-TEFb activity is required to overcome repressive effects of histone modifications. The study reveals a novel function of a conserved, co-transcriptional histone modification and highlights the importance of balancing the opposing functions of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 to regulate elongation.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America and Africa. A phylogenetic analysis of the prM/E gene region from 133 viral isolates sampled from 22 countries over 76 years revealed that the currently circulating strains of YFV originated in Africa within the last 1,500 years. The virus emerged in the Americas approximately 300-400 years ago, following the slave trade, and spread westwards across the continent, persisting in the jungles of South America. The phylogenetic analysis showed that YFV can be divided into two geographic groups, with distinct viral lineages observed in Africa and the Americas. The study found no major difference in evolutionary dynamics among viruses circulating in South America or Africa, and neither population exhibited the increases in virus diversity expected of epidemic expansion. The virus established a sylvatic enzootic cycle within the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins, vectored by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. The introduction of YFV to the Americas is attributed to the slave trade, supported by gene sequence data and modern phylogenetic techniques for estimating divergence times. This study demonstrates the utility of gene sequence data in testing hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and highlights the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.
The study investigated the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. The research aimed to identify vulnerable points in the multiple steps involved in pneumococcal pathogenesis by analyzing population bottlenecks. The findings revealed that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. These observations demonstrate how viral infection and TLR-dependent innate immune responses drive bacterial contagion. The study employed an infant mouse model that recapitulates many of the key features of pneumococcal pathogenesis, including colonization, localized and systemic disease, and host-to-host transmission. The results suggest that IAV co-infection increases the burden of colonizing pneumococci, and the tight population bottleneck in the setting of IAV could be due to the selection of a subpopulation of pneumococci or passage through a bottleneck requiring selection among pre-existing variants.
The study aimed to evaluate the exposure to Phlebotomus orientalis bites in human populations from visceral leishmaniasis-endemic areas in Eastern Africa by testing antibody reactions against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. Recombinant proteins derived from P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced using bacterial and mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detecting anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia were screened using ELISA and immunoblotting to identify potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins, mYEL1 and mAG5, were identified as the most promising antigens, showing high correlation coefficients and specificity compared to whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins increased the correlation coefficients and positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. This study is the first to report screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1 and mAG5 proved to be valid antigens for screening human sera from both Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The combination of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses. The study identified the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 as a valid tool to screen sand fly exposure in humans from both Sudan and Ethiopia. This combination of stable recombinant proteins can substitute P. orientalis salivary gland homogenate, simplifying studies aimed at detecting antibodies in bitten people in endemic areas of visceral leishmaniasis.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is mobilized in trans by IncA and IncC plasmids (A/C plasmids) following its excision from the chromosome, an event triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD encoded by these helper plasmids. Although SGI1 is not self-transmissible, it carries three genes, traNS, traHS, and traGS, coding for distant homologs of the predicted mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC, respectively, encoded by A/C plasmids. This study investigated the regulation of traNS and traHGS and the role of these three genes in the transmissibility of SGI1. Transcriptional fusion of the promoter sequences of traNS and traHGS to the reporter gene lacZ confirmed that expression of these genes is inducible by AcaCD. Mating experiments using combinations of deletion mutants of SGI1 and the helper IncC plasmid pVCR94 revealed complex interactions between these two mobile genetic elements. The study found that TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins that replace TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids, and that remodeling of the IncC-encoded mating pore by SGI1 is essential to enhance transfer rate of SGI1 over the helper plasmid. TraGS was found to be crucial to allow DNA transfer between cells bearing IncC helper plasmids, suggesting that SGI1 disables an IncC-encoded entry exclusion mechanism.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 has been found to inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53, leading to checkpoint adaptation. Checkpoint adaptation occurs when cells are presented with persistent or irreparable DNA damage and escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the DNA damage checkpoint. Overexpression of Cdc5 promotes faster adaptation, indicating that high levels of Cdc5 modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit the downstream cell-cycle machinery. Cdc5 overproduction was found to have little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation, including checkpoint sensor localization, Mec1-phosphorylation of Rad9, and formation of the Rad9-Rad53 complex. However, damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 was significantly reduced, consistent with the observation that cell-cycle arrest is lost during adaptation. This suggests that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through the loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage. This mechanism is likely conserved in vertebrates, as polo-like kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases. The timing of adaptation onset correlated with the loss of Rad53 activity, suggesting that adaptation may be a consequence of Cdc5-mediated checkpoint inhibition.
The Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework is a computational model that simulates the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on large spatiotemporal scales. This framework is essential for understanding pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, which are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the ECS. The KNP framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes by assuming electroneutrality, making it feasible to run simulations on millimeter and second scales on a standard desktop computer. In contrast to previous models, the 3-D KNP framework predicts how ion concentrations vary in all spatial directions surrounding neuronal sources, allowing for a broader range of biological problems to be addressed. The KNP-scheme is the first simulation framework that can handle 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at relatively large spatiotemporal scales without demanding excessive computer power. The framework was used to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell, demonstrating its efficiency. Future applications of the KNP framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS. The KNP framework can be used in a hybrid simulation setup where the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the ECS are computed with KNP, while the neurodynamics is computed with the NEURON simulator tool.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vector-borne diseases program has the potential to leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. A mathematical model was used to evaluate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment, specifically the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results showed that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The study found that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the costs needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without considering the cost in human lives and well-being. The analysis suggests that the proposed budget cut could virtually paralyze surveillance and research activities for diseases already circulating in the US, such as dengue and West Nile virus, and jeopardize the capability of the existing health infrastructure for early detection of other exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The study emphasizes the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance and provides a science-based justification for re-assessing the current proposal to slash the CDC vector-borne diseases program budget.
In a prospective study conducted in western Nicaragua, researchers investigated the prevalence of dengue fever among children and adults presenting with acute febrile illness. A total of 740 patients, aged 1 year and above, were enrolled and tested for dengue IgG and IgM antibodies, as well as serotyped for dengue virus using reverse transcriptase-PCR. The results showed that 63.5% of the patients were seropositive for dengue at enrollment, with the seroprevalence increasing with age, reaching over 90% in individuals above 20 years. Acute dengue was identified in 5.1% of the patients, with serotypes 1 and 2 being the most common. Notably, only 8.1% of the confirmed cases were suspected clinically, highlighting the importance of dengue as a largely unrecognized cause of fever in the region. The study also found that dengue was the only flavivirus circulating in humans in Nicaragua during the study period, reducing the likelihood of serologic cross-reactions with other flaviviruses. The median age of patients with acute dengue was 16 years, and the symptoms and signs were similar to those of other acute febrile illnesses. The study's findings suggest that dengue is a significant public health concern in western Nicaragua, particularly given the region's vulnerability to the Zika virus, which is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor–like kinase NILR1 plays a crucial role in the induction of innate immunity to parasitic nematodes. Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant economic losses worldwide, and an effective plant defense against them relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity ( PTI ). While PTI has been extensively studied in various plant-pathogen interactions, its role in plant-nematode interactions remains poorly understood. This study demonstrates that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitors can induce PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. The researchers identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, NILR1, which is specifically regulated upon nematode infection and is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. Loss-of-function mutants of NILR1 are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes. NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor involved in the induction of basal immunity ( PTI ) in plants or animals in response to nematodes. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions and offers potential options for nematode control in crop plants.
The study investigated the effect of miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, on the surface antigens of Schistosoma mansoni adult worms in vitro. The results showed that miltefosine treatment enhanced the exposure of worm surface antigens, which were recognized by rabbit anti-S. mansoni adult worm homogenate and anti-S. mansoni infection antisera in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Four proteins reacting with the antibodies were identified as fructose-1,6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These antibodies also bound to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induced immune agglutination of the parasites, suggesting a potential role in immune protection. The study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent, where treatment unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. The antigens involved in this molecular mechanism could have potential as intervention targets, and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of action of miltefosine and its potential as a treatment for schistosomiasis.
In the human opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus, the surface protein IlsA plays a crucial role in iron acquisition from host ferritin. Ferritin is a 24-mer nanocage protein that stores thousands of iron atoms within its cavity. IlsA binds to ferritin through direct interaction with the shell subunits, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry data indicate that IlsA binds several types of ferritins, and UV-vis kinetic data show a significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of IlsA. This is the first time a bacterial protein has been shown to alter the stability of the ferritin iron core. Disruption of the siderophore bacillibactin production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus is proposed, involving the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. The results highlight a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore and provide new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the ability of IlsA to bind ferritin is a universally conserved feature of the composite NEAT-LRR proteins found in other pathogenic bacteria.
A thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been developed. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains: CI and CII. The model proposes that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformational state. Phosphorylation of the CII domain serves as a timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also explains how KaiA acts as a nucleotide exchange factor to stimulate phosphorylation of KaiC and how the differential affinity of KaiA for different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, stabilizing this state and leading to the sequestration of KaiA and KaiC dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm was used to simulate the system, demonstrating that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data. The model provides a thermodynamically consistent explanation for the post-translational Kai circadian clock, resolving the long-standing question of how the clock is driven thermodynamically.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppresses innate immune signaling to establish persistent infection. Although HBV is a DNA virus, its pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) can be sensed by RIG-I and activates MAVS to mediate interferon (IFN) λ synthesis. However, the underlying mechanism explaining how HBV infection fails to induce interferon-αβ (IFN) synthesis remained uncharacterized. This study demonstrates that HBV induces parkin to recruit the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria and abrogates IFN β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, to disrupt MAVS signalosome and attenuate IRF3 activation. This study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling, which involves LUBAC being recruited to the mitochondria. Parkin silencing restores IFN β synthesis in HBV-expressing cells upon stimulation with RIG-I agonist pI:C. These findings establish the molecular mechanism of HBV-induced suppression of innate immunity and provide avenues of investigation on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. The study suggests that HBV-induced mitochondrially-localized Parkin interacts with MAVS and causes its ubiquitination, leading to the enrichment of M-1 linked polyubiquitin chains on MAVS, which disrupts its interaction with downstream TRAFs and abrogates IRF-3 activation.
The crystal structure of pfiT, a T-cell superantigen associated with human Crohn's disease, has been determined at 1.7Å resolution. PfiT, encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, is a novel enteric T-cell superantigen that stimulates the proliferation of human lymphocytes. The structure of pfiT reveals that it belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators, indicating that it represents a new family of T-cell superantigens. Both pfiT and its homolog, PA2885, bind to mammalian cells and interact with human class II MHC molecules, specifically HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. The binding of pfiT to HLA-DR is inhibited by anti-class II MHC antibodies, indicating that the interaction is class II MHC-specific. Competition studies show that pfiT and the superantigen Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM) compete for binding to HLA-DR, suggesting that their binding sites overlap. Furthermore, pfiT directly interacts with HLA-DR1, as demonstrated by GST-pfiT efficiently precipitating both endogenous and in vitro purified recombinant HLA-DR1 molecules. These findings suggest that pfiT is a structurally novel Crohn's disease-associated superantigen that plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The discovery of pfiT and its interaction with class II MHC molecules provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease.
This study investigated the role of allelic regulation in the heterogeneity of Nanog expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency and exhibits a disperse distribution within ESC populations. The authors developed a multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework to model the dynamics of Nanog expression, considering allelic control, gene expression noise, and random partitioning at cell division. The results showed that allelic regulation of Nanog leads to three distinct states of Nanog expression, which becomes bimodal when combined with transcriptional noise. The study found that initially uniform populations of ESCs gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles, regardless of their allelic expression pattern. Depletion of Nanog content in cells switching off both gene alleles was slower than the accumulation of intracellular Nanog after cells turned on at least one of their Nanog gene copies, indicating Nanog state-dependent dynamics. The study also highlighted the importance of allelic regulation in maintaining fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency. The findings suggest that allelic control of Nanog expression is a prime determinant of ESC population heterogeneity and warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming.
The article presents a study on the quantification and classification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteome utilization and unused protein costs across various environments. Using a combination of absolute and global proteomics data and a genome-scale model of E. coli, the researchers computed the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per-gene basis. The results show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains more than 95% of the variance in growth rates of E. coli across 16 distinct environments. The study also reveals that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Furthermore, the classification of unused protein reveals that it encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. The findings suggest that unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change. The study provides a baseline understanding of the percentage of the microbial proteome that is un-utilized in a given environment and how much the un-utilized protein fraction can vary across environments. The results have implications for understanding the evolution and regulation of proteome expression in microbes.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 3,955 Chinese, 2,034 Malays, and 2,146 Asian Indians to investigate the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in multi-ethnic cohorts from Southeast Asia. The study aimed to assess the transferability and relevance of previously identified T2D-associated loci in European populations to the three major ethnic populations of Asia, which comprise half of the world's population. A meta-analysis of the three studies revealed strong associations at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, which have consistently emerged in T2D studies across multiple global populations. However, the signals of association at CDKAL1 showed varying effect sizes across populations, with similar or larger effects in Chinese and Indian populations compared to European studies. Conditional analysis at these loci revealed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity, as well as variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations. These findings highlight the importance of surveying diverse racial/ethnic groups to fine-map causal variants and identify population-specific variants. The study demonstrates the value of GWAS in identifying novel genetic loci associated with T2D and underscores the need for further research to understand the genetic etiology of T2D in diverse populations.
In the basidiomycetous budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, nuclear division occurs in the daughter cell during mitosis. Aurora B kinase Ipl1 plays a crucial role in regulating this process. Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and is essential for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope. It also regulates structural integrity of microtubules. Depletion of Ipl1 results in compromised stability of cytoplasmic microtubules, leading to delayed kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. An in silico model predicts that cytoplasmic microtubules and cortical dyneins promote atypical nuclear division in C. neoformans. The model also suggests that an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic Bim1 and dynein regulates dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. In vivo alterations of Bim1 or dynein cellular levels delay nuclear migration. Ipl1 spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. The timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry, facilitating spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans. Ipl1 is essential for viability and orchestrates pre-anaphase nuclear movement from the mother cell to the daughter in C. neoformans. It maintains microtubule stability to facilitate timely kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Ipl1 spatio-temporally regulates cytoplasmic microtubules and spatial distribution of Bim1 and/or dynein in the cell.
This study investigated the role of a synonymous mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in an aggressive case of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). A patient with MTC harbored a somatic RET p.Cys634Arg mutation, a known driver mutation, and a germ-line RET p.Cys630= substitution, initially considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the RET mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed increased RET transcript levels in the patient compared to seven other MTCs with the p.Cys634Arg mutation. Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the synonymous RET mutation was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the p.Cys630= variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. These findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. The study highlights the importance of considering the potential oncogenic effects of synonymous mutations, which are often filtered out from large-scale cancer genome studies.
A new bioinformatics system has been developed to remove contaminants and low-complexity genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This system was applied to a comprehensive database of sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, resulting in a “clean” database for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. The system was tested on 245 eukaryotic pathogen draft genomes, identifying and removing human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complexity genomic sequences that can lead to false positives. The cleaned database was found to provide better sensitivity and a dramatic reduction in false positives when used for metagenomic sample analysis compared to the original genomes. The system can be used on both complete and draft reference genomes, making it a valuable tool for improving the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis of human infections. The development of this system addresses the issue of contamination in published genomes, which has hindered the use of reference databases for accurate diagnosis. The cleaned database is now available for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for next-generation sequencing diagnostics, with decreased false positive and false negative rates.
The study investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Nagana. A total of 269 T. brucei isolates were genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci and screened for the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense. The results showed that the isolates from Uganda and southwestern Kenya can be partitioned into three distinct genetic clusters. Cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. The analysis also revealed genetic admixture among the three clusters and long-range dispersal, indicating recent and possibly ongoing gene flow between them. The study found that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). Additionally, the results confirmed the emergence of human-infective strains (Tbr) from non-infective T. b. brucei (Tbb) strains of different genetic backgrounds and highlighted the importance of cattle as Tbr reservoirs in shaping the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. The study's findings have implications for the control and prevention of HAT and Nagana in Uganda.
This study investigated the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. Mice deficient in TXNIP (Txnip−/−) were found to be significantly more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock compared to wild-type mice. The increased susceptibility was attributed to excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Txnip−/− macrophages. An iNOS inhibitor rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, indicating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock. The study also found that Txnip−/− mice had reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The results suggest that TXNIP regulates NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The NF-κB/iNOS pathway was found to be involved in the regulation of NO production in the absence of TXNIP. Furthermore, excessive NO production in Txnip−/− mice inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion via direct S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Overall, the study demonstrates that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The findings suggest that TXNIP plays a critical role as a negative modulator of NO and iNOS expression during LPS-induced endotoxic shock.
ZTF-8, a protein conserved from worms to humans, has been identified as a novel factor involved in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) as well as in meiotic DNA damage checkpoint activation in the C. elegans germline. ZTF-8 mutants exhibit sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic nuclear arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of the ATL-1 and CHK-1 DNA damage checkpoint kinases, and accumulation of both mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates. This suggests that ZTF-8 functions in DNA damage response ( DDR ) and double-strand break repair ( DSBR ). ZTF-8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1-1 DDR complex and interacts with MRT-2/Rad1, a component of this complex. The human RHINO protein rescues the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, indicating functional conservation across species. ZTF-8 is proposed to promote repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway. ZTF-8 localizes to both chromatin and the nucleolus, and changes in its subcellular localization in response to DNA damage support a role for ZTF-8 in DDR and DNA repair. Loss of ZTF-8 function results in partially impaired activation of germ cell apoptosis, reduced brood size, and accumulation of RAD-51 foci, all of which are rescued in transgenic worms expressing human RHINO. These findings define a conserved function for ZTF-8/RHINO in promoting genomic stability in the germline.
During neural tube development, motor neuron ( MN ) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Using single cell transcriptomics, researchers investigated the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. The study found that the MN determinant Olig2 plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2 represses the expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5, with Olig2 repression of Hes5 appearing to be direct and mediated by a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus. This regulatory element restricts Hes5 expression in MN progenitors. The findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation, and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as a developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation. The study also suggests that Notch signaling controls the transition between distinct phases of Olig2 expression by restraining Olig2 expression in MN progenitors. Inhibition of Notch signaling leads to an increase in Olig2 expression and neuronal differentiation, indicating that Olig2 up-regulation is necessary for MN development to proceed in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. These findings establish a mechanism by which neural patterning and neurogenesis intersect, with Olig2 modulating the Notch pathway to specify MN identity and determine the rate of differentiation.
A nonhuman primate model was used to investigate the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm). Five rhesus macaques were first infected with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to "prime" their cellular immunity. Four months later, these animals and seven naive controls were challenged with H1N1pdm. The results showed that the "primed" animals had a more rapid and robust T cell response to H1N1pdm, with activated T cells appearing in the blood and lung as early as two days post-inoculation. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and peaked earlier and at a higher magnitude than in naive animals. The "primed" animals also cleared H1N1pdm infection significantly earlier from the upper and lower respiratory tract than the naive animals, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates. The findings have implications for the development of vaccines that can induce such cross-reactive T cells to protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses. The results are consistent with previous studies in mice and ferrets, which have shown that cross-reactive T cells can provide protection against lethal challenge with H1N1pdm.
A novel Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay has been developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever. The LAMP assay targets the repeated sequence IS1111a of the htpAB gene of C. burnetii using a universal primer set designed with PrimerExplorer V4 software. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was evaluated using known quantities of recombined reference plasmids containing the targeted genes, with a detection limit of 1 copy per reaction. The specificity of the assay was determined using 26 members of the order Rickettsiae and 18 other common pathogens, with no cross-reaction observed. The LAMP assay was compared to real-time PCR in 24 blood samples, including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases diagnosed by IFA serological assessment and real-time PCR. The results showed a positive rate of 33.3% for the LAMP assay and 8.3% for real-time PCR (P < 0.05) in unknown febrile patients, and 7.9% for the LAMP assay and 0.8% for real-time PCR (P < 0.01) in animals. The LAMP assay was also used to confirm Q fever in the Yi Li area, Xinjiang Province. The study concludes that the LAMP assay is a potential tool for the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and domestic animals, particularly in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without the need for sophisticated equipment or complicated protocols.
Biomedical research has shown that cancers often exhibit gene expression profiles similar to those of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the mechanisms controlling these expression programs have not been fully understood. A recent study explored transcriptional enhancers throughout hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers, revealing a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations known as embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers (ESSEs). These ESSEs are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers of the hematopoietic cell lineage and are prone to DNA methylation changes, indicative of their chromatin activity states. The study found that methylation of ESSEs is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer, with methylated ESSEs being hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes. Conversely, unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Further analysis of a hypomethylated ESSE downstream to the VEGFA gene revealed a novel regulatory circuit affecting VEGFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. The study suggests that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for the reactivation of ESC genes in cancer. The results indicate that ES enhancers are specifically prone to methylation perturbations in cancers and that hypomethylation of ESSEs is associated with the up-regulation of ESC genes in cancer cells. The study provides evidence that the DNA methylation state of ESSEs strongly affects its activity level as a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells.
The article investigates the effect of population subdivision on the time it takes for a population to cross fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape. The authors use a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, without requiring significant size changes of the demes, environmental heterogeneity, or specific geographic structure. They determine the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, assuming the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. The results show that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, the authors obtain analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved, where valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is as fast as that of its fastest deme. Stochastic simulations verify the analytical predictions. The study demonstrates that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, extending beyond the optimal window. The authors also investigate the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population and the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. The results hold for weakly beneficial intermediate mutations and are extended to the case of a population connected by migration to one or several smaller islands, showing that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus.
The midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, undergoes significant metabolic changes during dengue virus ( DENV ) infection. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, researchers analyzed the temporal metabolic perturbations in the midgut tissue of Aedes aegypti following DENV infection. The study revealed a dynamic remodeling of lipids that coincides with viral replication, including increases in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls. These changes suggest a diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways during infection. Elevated levels of acyl-carnitines indicate disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway was identified as critical for the virus life cycle. The study also reconstructed the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti for the first time. The findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes. The study provides new insights into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti and identifies potential targets for disrupting transmission of these viruses. The results have implications for the development of novel strategies to control the spread of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses.
A parsimonious model of the rabbit action potential (AP) has been developed to elucidate the minimal physiological requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup. The model combines a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage relationships during the AP upstroke, rapid recovery of AP excitability during the relative refractory period, and steady-state INa inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced several important phenomena, including cellular alternans at rates > 250 bpm, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants were studied to elucidate the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup, which were found to be the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK. The simplicity of the model and the physiological meaning of its parameters make it ideal for generating generalizable mechanistic insight and provide a solid foundation for generating more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology. The model's ability to reproduce emergent phenomena and its parsimonious nature make it a valuable tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.
During the sexual cycle of Paramecium, the somatic genome is assembled through the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences ( IESs ). These IESs are flanked by two TA dinucleotides and their excision is initiated by developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) that depend on the domesticated transposase PiggyMac. The molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes have remained unknown. This study demonstrates that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway ( NHEJ ), are required for the repair of IES excision sites and the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends. At the nucleotide level, controlled removal of the 5′-terminal nucleotide occurs normally in LIG4-silenced cells, while nucleotide addition to the 3′ ends of the breaks is blocked, indicating a coupling between NHEJ polymerase and ligase activities. The data indicate that IES excision is a “cut-and-close” mechanism involving the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This work broadens our understanding of how the cellular NHEJ pathway has cooperated with domesticated transposases for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics.
A subanalysis of the REMADHE prospective trial was conducted to investigate the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing it with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. The study analyzed 342 patients and found that 185 (54.1%) died, with 56.4% of deaths occurring in Chagas patients and 53.7% in non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. The Cox regression model identified Chagas etiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and the use of amiodarone as independent predictors of heart failure mortality, while left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and the use of beta-blockers were independently associated with sudden death mortality. The results suggest that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications for the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death. The study highlights the need for a precise understanding of the natural history of patients with systolic dysfunction to plan adequate health policies and improve survival.
Plant cells employ a defense strategy against geminivirus infection through the regulated nuclear trafficking of ribosomal protein L10A ( rpL10A ) mediated by the NSP-interacting kinase 1 ( NIK1 ). NIK1 is a receptor-like kinase that interacts with the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein ( NSP ), but the molecular mechanism linking NIK1 activation to antiviral response was unclear. The study identified rpL10A as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1, functioning as an immediate downstream effector of NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus, where it may modulate viral infection. Ectopic expression of normal NIK1 or a hyperactive NIK1 mutant promotes the accumulation of phosphorylated rpL10A within the nuclei, while an inactive NIK1 mutant fails to redirect the protein to the nuclei of co-transfected cells. Loss of rpL10A function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, resembling the phenotype of nik1 null alleles. Geminivirus infection directly interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. The NIK1-mediated defense signaling inhibits plant growth and development but does not activate RNA silencing or promote a hypersensitive response. The study suggests that the NIK1-mediated signaling response may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses.
The study investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a human pathogenic fungus, during its interaction with the host immune system. AOX is an enzyme involved in maintaining intracellular redox balance and has been associated with the reduction of mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The researchers generated a strain of P. brasiliensis with reduced AOX expression using antisense RNA technology and evaluated its interaction with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. The results showed that P. brasiliensis conidia and yeast cells with reduced AOX expression had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. In a mouse model of infection, the absence of wild-type levels of AOX in P. brasiliensis resulted in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. Additionally, P. brasiliensis yeast cells exposed to exogenous H2O2 showed increased AOX expression and higher viability compared to cells with reduced AOX expression. These findings support the hypothesis that AOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. The study suggests that AOX plays a crucial role in the pathogenicity of P. brasiliensis, particularly during the initial phase of infection when fungal cells must adapt to oxidative stress generated by immune cells.
A recent study investigated the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampal region CA3 in supporting episodic-like memory. The study used a rate remapping paradigm to morph one familiar context into another and observed the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. The results showed that average population activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics. To understand these findings, a neural network model of the CA3 was developed with attractors for both position and discrete contexts. The model showed that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. This resulted in smooth transition curves when averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels. The results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells. This mechanism may also be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex. The study provides new insights into the neural basis of episodic-like memory and the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and extra intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. The parasite is exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection, but lacks key components of canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense systems. To investigate how E. histolytica responds to oxidative stress, trophozoites were exposed to hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) or paraquat ( PQ ). Metabolomic analysis using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Oxidative stress resulted in the inhibition of glycolysis, leading to the redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. The repression of glycolysis was evidenced by the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate and reduced ethanol production, resulting in decreased levels of nucleoside triphosphates. Notably, the study demonstrated the presence of a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, with increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress. The findings suggest that the glycerol biosynthetic pathway may serve as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica.
IKAROS is a crucial regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is necessary for proper hematopoiesis. IKAROS collaborates with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase ( NuRD ) complex to promote gene repression and activation. However, the mechanism by which IKAROS supports transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing complex NuRD remained unclear. This study demonstrates that IKAROS binds to the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b ( P-TEFb ) at gene promoters and that NuRD and P-TEFb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α ( PP1α ) to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impairs normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and promotes transcription elongation. These findings suggest that IKAROS is the DNA-binding subunit of the NuRD-P-TEFb multifunctional complex, which contains chromatin remodeling and gene transcription elongation activities. IKAROS is essential for CDK9 and Mi2 interaction and combined recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematopoietic cells.
This study investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses (RABV) associated with outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. Molecular characterization of Trinidadian RABV sequences revealed that they belong to the bat-associated Clade 2 and cluster into three largely temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I, IIa, and IIb. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that these lineages arose from three separate introductions of RABV from the South American mainland. The Trinidad I lineage is most closely related to RABV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, while the Trinidad II lineage is most closely related to RABV from Brazil and Uruguay. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions indicate periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. The study also found evidence of co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa in 2000. The results suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, particularly any movement between the mainland and Trinidad. The study highlights the importance of monitoring bat species with migratory habits to determine if RABV variants different from those associated with vampire bats are also being introduced into Trinidad.
A Boolean model of the gene regulatory network underlying mammalian cortical area development was used to investigate the interactions between Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8. These genes play a crucial role in specifying areal identity along the anterior-posterior axis of the cerebral cortex. The model treated expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the expression data available. Simulations of all possible networks containing the five genes of interest revealed that only a subset of networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks lacked certain interactions, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. An analysis of the probability of each interaction suggested that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. The model illuminated the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and made novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The results suggest that Fgf8 expression at the anterior pole may be sufficient to drive the correct spatial patterning of the transcription factors Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, if simple interactions between these transcription factors exist. The study highlights the potential of Boolean models to reveal logical principles underlying genetic regulation of cortical arealization and guide future experiments.
This study reports the genome-wide localization of the Bmi1-dependent ubiquitylated histone H2A (uH2A) mark in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology. The results show that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched at the promoters of well-annotated genes, with a peak of uH2A located just inside the transcription start site (TSS). This peak is associated with the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes in wild-type MEF cells. The study also identifies regions of local uH2A enrichment throughout the mouse genome, including almost 700 gene promoters. Genes with promoter peaks of uH2A exhibit lower-level expression compared to genes without promoter peaks of uH2A. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that genes with uH2A peaks have increased expression upon Bmi1 knockout. Importantly, local enrichment of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark, suggesting that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism from that in embryonic stem cells. The study also reveals a link between DNA methylation and uH2A at high-density CpG promoters, and suggests that DNA methylation may be upstream of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation. These findings provide new insights into the role of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in transcriptional regulation and its relationship with other epigenetic marks.
This study investigated the role of pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) in regulating mammary epithelial differentiation during pregnancy and lactation. PINC and retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) are upregulated in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alveolar cells that remain in the regressed lobules following involution. The authors found that PINC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors in the post-pubertal mouse mammary gland and its levels increase throughout pregnancy and then decline in early lactation. This reduction in PINC levels may be necessary for lactation, as overexpression of PINC in HC11 mammary epithelial cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of PINC enhances differentiation. PINC interacts with RbAp46 and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and the authors identified potential targets of PINC that are differentially expressed following modulation of PINC expression levels. The study suggests that PINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. Additionally, a PRC2 complex that includes PINC and RbAp46 may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of mammary epithelial differentiation during pregnancy and lactation.
PML/TRIM19, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, plays a crucial role in antiviral defense, particularly in the context of retroviral infections. Upon HIV-1 and other retroviral infections, PML undergoes rapid re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, forming PML cytoplasmic bodies. This re-localization is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription and is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors. PML knockdown significantly increases reverse-transcription efficiency, suggesting that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection. However, PML itself does not directly inhibit retroviral infection, but rather acts through the stabilization of its partner protein, Daxx. Daxx is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription. Furthermore, Daxx not only interferes with exogenous retroviral infections but also inhibits retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription. The findings of this study reveal a novel antiviral function for PML and its associated protein Daxx, providing new insights into the mechanisms of retroviral restriction and the role of PML/TRIM19 in antiviral defense.
The article introduces Matt, a new program for multiple protein structure alignment that incorporates local flexibility into the aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm. Unlike previous methods, Matt temporarily allows small translations and rotations between fragments to bring them closer together, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. This flexibility is restored in the final step before the alignment is output. Matt is tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. The results show that Matt's global performance is competitive with the other programs on Homstrad, but outperforms them on SABmark, a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant homology. Matt demonstrates an ability to better align the ends of α-helices and β-strands, an important characteristic of any structure alignment program intended to help construct a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem. The article also explores the use of Matt alignments to distinguish distantly homologous structure pairs from pairs of proteins that are not homologous. A p-value score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of Matt alignments is shown to largely separate decoys from homologous protein structures in the SABmark benchmark dataset. The authors suggest that Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.
During mitotic entry, Cdk1 is activated and PP2A/B55 is inactivated. Greatwall kinase inactivates PP2A/B55 via its substrates Ensa and ARPP19, which are regulated by phosphorylation. However, the dynamic regulation of Greatwall activity and the phosphatases that control Greatwall kinase and its substrates are poorly understood. To address this, a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments using phospho-specific antibodies were used to monitor Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. The results show that PP2A/B55 is required for the dephosphorylation of Greatwall at the essential Cdk site Thr194, and that Ensa/ARPP19 dephosphorylation is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block the dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit. Mathematical modeling indicates that mutual antagonism between Gwl and PP2A/B55 accelerates both mitotic entry and exit, and that phosphatases other than PP2A regulate additional phosphorylation sites and contribute to Gwl inactivation. The results provide new insights into the regulation of mitotic exit and the network of phosphatases that counteract Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk phosphorylation.
The development of neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit the replication of genetically diverse HIV-1 viruses and prevent new infections is a key aim for an HIV vaccine. To achieve this goal, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of Nab during the early stages of natural infection is crucial. This study investigated the dynamics of Nab and viral escape in two individuals with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection. The results show that viral escape occurred despite the development of high-titer autologous Nab in both subjects. To elucidate the escape pathways, Nab-resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants. In one subject, escape was driven predominantly by changes in the V3V5 region of gp120, while in the second subject, escape was driven by changes in the V1V2 region. Notably, the V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time and allowed the virus to evade two distinct monoclonal antibodies derived from the same patient. The findings suggest that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and that multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization. These results provide new insights into the complex dynamics of Nab and viral escape in HIV-1 infection.
This study investigates the extent of positive and negative selection across the genome of Capsella grandiflora, a plant species within the Brassicaceae family. The researchers sequenced the whole genomes of 13 individuals and found that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). However, conserved noncoding regions across the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection. The study also observed reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Furthermore, expression data from leaf tissue revealed that genes with higher expression experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. The results suggest that both positive and negative selection are widespread in coding and regulatory regions, but are less common in plant noncoding sequences compared to animal genomes. The study highlights the importance of considering both positive and negative selection in understanding genome function and the maintenance of genetic variation. The findings also provide insights into the evolution of plant genomes, particularly in noncoding regions, and suggest that regulatory evolution may occur differently in plants compared to animals.
The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 plays a crucial role in transforming resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can give rise to malignancies. EBNA2 drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of two master regulators of B-cell fate, EBF1 and RBP-jκ. Unlike previous studies suggesting static binding of these factors to target gene promoters, EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with transcriptional activation of linked genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, as the number of RBP-jκ binding sites is largely increased. EBNA2 colocalizes with EBF1 and RBP-jκ at many enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. These findings demonstrate that EBNA2 reprograms the chromosome binding patterns of host master regulatory transcription factors RBP-jκ and EBF1.
The Neovolcanic axis (NVA) in Mexico acts as a barrier to gene flow among Aedes aegypti populations that differ in their vector competence for dengue 2 virus (DENV2). Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector of the four serotypes of dengue virus. Population genetic studies have shown that the NVA, which intersects with the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz, separates Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the axis. These populations also exhibit differences in vector competence for DENV2, with mosquitoes from north of the NVA having an average vector competence rate of 0.55, compared to 0.20 for those from south of the NVA. The variation in vector competence is largely due to midgut infection and escape barriers, with 21.5% of mosquitoes from north of the NVA failing to develop midgut infections and 30.3% of those with an infected midgut failing to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, 45.2% of mosquitoes from south of the NVA failed to develop midgut infections and 62.8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. The study suggests that barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further research is needed to determine why the NVA acts as a barrier to gene flow and whether the differences in vector competence are stable and epidemiologically significant.
The DnaA protein plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli, cycling between an active ATP-bound form and an inactive ADP-bound form. Previous studies suggested that DnaA is the main controller of initiation frequency, with initiation occurring when enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated. However, a recent study investigated whether an excess of ATP-DnaA would lead to earlier initiation of replication. Contrary to expectations, cells with a 50% increase in ATP-DnaA concentration showed no changes in the timing of replication. This suggests that while DnaA is the main actor in initiation of replication, its accumulation does not control the timing of initiation. Instead, other factors are required to govern the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. The study also explored the in vivo roles of DnaA-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA, finding that loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein. The results indicate that compromised cell cycle machinery performs in a less robust manner. The study proposes that E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by the cycling of ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA levels, and that signals depending on the cell's environment govern the exact timing of initiation.
The article introduces a novel approach called partial Granger causality to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. Granger causality is a statistical method used to identify causal relationships between time series data. However, traditional Granger causality methods can be misleading when dealing with exogenous inputs and latent variables. To address this issue, the authors propose a partial Granger causality approach that takes into account the conditional variance of the data. This method is extensively tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data from HeLa cells, in vivo local field potentials (LFPs) from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and LFPs from the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. The results show that the partial Granger causality approach can reliably reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables. In contrast, traditional Granger causality methods can yield contradicting results between the time and frequency domains. The authors also demonstrate the importance of considering exogenous inputs and latent variables in Granger causality analysis using a toy model and experimental data from a visual pattern discrimination task in a macaque monkey. The results highlight the potential of the partial Granger causality approach for uncovering interactions in complex biological systems.
Title: Enhanced Methods for Local Ancestry Assignment in Sequenced Admixed Individuals
    The article presents new methods for inferring the ancestry at each locus in the genome of recently admixed individuals, such as Latino Americans. These methods leverage continent-specific variants (CSVs) to attain increased performance over existing approaches in sequenced admixed genomes. The approach incorporates the admixed genomes jointly with public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes, to improve the accuracy of CSV calling. The authors use simulations to show that their approach attains accuracy similar to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with large decreases in runtime. They also demonstrate that their method recovers comparable local ancestries to the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Furthermore, the authors extend their approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Additionally, they generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and show that it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments based on sCSVs. The methods presented in this article provide a fast and accurate approach for local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes, which is critical for medical and population genetic inferences.
A new approach to identifying circadian baseline oscillation in mammalian gene expression has been proposed using digital signal processing algorithms. Previous studies have reported that 10%–15% of all genes oscillate in a daily rhythm, regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of periodicity have been limited by the small size of datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. The proposed method involves applying digital signal processing algorithms separately to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity. This approach identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes. The results suggest that circadian oscillation is a natural and important feature of all or nearly all biological pathways. Genes that display daily variation in their expression level may or may not be linked directly to the circadian molecular clock, but the oscillation of these genes and their encoded protein products will affect all elements of the system as a whole. The amplitude of core circadian genes does not stand out from the majority of expressed genes and shows no significant variation among tissues. This finding implies that changes in gene expression caused by mutations or regulation of environmental factors should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations. As a result, circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways.
The study presents a high-resolution mapping of crossover and non-crossover recombination events in an avian system using whole-genome re-sequencing of a three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree. A total of 325 crossover events were identified at a median resolution of 1. 4 kb, with 86% of the events localized to regions less than 10 kb in size. Observed crossover rates were found to be 52% higher in male meiosis ( 3. 56 cM/Mb ) than in female meiosis ( 2. 28 cM/Mb ), and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands. Additionally, 267 non-crossover events were identified, whose location was significantly associated with crossover locations. The study also detected a significant transmission bias in favour of ‘strong’ ( G, C ) over ‘weak’ ( A, T ) alleles at non-crossover events, providing evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. The approach used in this study can be applied to any species, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the recombination landscape across different organism groups. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the recombination landscape and its impact on sequence evolution at a local scale.
The energy landscapes of repeat-containing proteins can be analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem due to their inherent symmetries in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure. A formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, treated as spin variables, provides a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes. This approach allows for the derivation of the overall folding properties of a complete domain, including stability and cooperativity of the repeating array. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding free-energy (ΔGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not apply to globular proteins. The parameters for the coarse-grained description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. A case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins illustrates the ideas and quantitatively relates the results to experimentally observed folding transitions. The study suggests that natural repeat proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics, allowing them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions. The minimal frustration principle and the near periodicity of repeat proteins allow for a general description of their energy landscape, which can help appreciate their biological function.
The study investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CHOP expression was found to be up-regulated in liver tumors in human HCC and two mouse models. Mice lacking CHOP (Chop-null mice) were resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and exhibited reduced apoptosis and cellular proliferation. These mice also showed attenuation of fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Global gene expression profiling revealed that deletion of CHOP reduced basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. The results suggest that CHOP contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. The study implicates CHOP as a common contributing factor in the development of HCC in various chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. The findings place CHOP upstream of fibrosis and tumorigenesis, suggesting a stepwise progression from CHOP expression to liver tumors. The study reveals an unexpected molecular link between hepatocarcinogenesis and the stimuli that predispose to it, and understanding the mechanisms by which CHOP promotes oncogenesis may have implications for other cancers beyond HCC. The data indicate that CHOP expression broadly characterizes HCC tumors and suggests that the impacts of CHOP on inflammatory gene expression and fibrosis are relevant to human HCC.
Leishmania aethiopica is the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia, resulting in severe and complicated cases such as diffuse CL (DCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, or extensive CL, which require systemic treatment. Despite the substantial burden, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. A systematic review of clinical studies on treatment outcomes of CL due to L. aethiopica was conducted to identify potentially efficacious medications for further clinical trials. The review included 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL presumably due to L. aethiopica. Antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy were the most commonly used treatments, with cure rates ranging from 60-80% for cryotherapy and 69-85% for antimonials. Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, including cases non-responsive to antimonials. However, all studies suffered from methodological limitations. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B are scarce, and only a few studies are available on DCL. Antimonials remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials on CL due to L. aethiopica are urgently needed to evaluate several options in parallel. The evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L. aethiopica is extremely limited, warranting prospective clinical studies.
A biochemical oscillator has been reconstituted in vitro using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which display the salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-h periodicity that is temperature-compensated. The biochemical basis of this oscillator was analyzed by quantifying the time-dependent interactions of the three proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of the formation of complexes among the Kai proteins. The data were used to derive a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiABC complexes and of KaiC phosphorylation, and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. The model demonstrates that the function of monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers may be to maintain synchrony among the KaiC hexamers in the reaction, thereby sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to confirm that monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers occurs. Additionally, the first perturbation analyses of an in vitro oscillator were performed by using temperature pulses to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, thereby testing the resetting characteristics of this unique circadian oscillator. The study provides an unprecedented level of molecular detail in the analysis of a circadian clockwork.
The relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance has been extensively studied using event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, the vast majority of these studies have only investigated a monotonic relationship between the two. A recent finding suggests that across-trial variability can correlate with behavioral performance independently of trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U-shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output. Using electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment, the present study provides evidence for an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship. The results show that when the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times are faster. This relationship is observed not only in post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. The findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance. The proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance. The study demonstrates that variability reduction can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity in both stimulus modulation and correlation with behavior, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance.
Biologists have investigated the evolution of mating-type loci in basidiomycete fungi, a group of organisms that undergo sexual development through cell and nuclear fusion. Mating compatibility in these fungi is governed by the mating-type ( MAT ) loci, which contain homeodomain transcription factor genes ( HD locus ) and pheromone and pheromone receptor genes ( P/R locus ). The ancestral state of basidiomycetes is thought to be tetrapolar, with two genetically unlinked MAT loci. However, some basidiomycetes have bipolar mating systems, which can arise through genomic linkage of the HD and P/R loci or loss of function of the P/R locus. In the order Tremellales, bipolarity is found only in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. This study analyzed MAT loci from 24 species of the Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales, and found that the MAT loci are fused and contain a single HD gene in each mating type, similar to the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the HD and P/R allele combinations in the Trichosporonales are different from those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. The results suggest that fusion of the HD and P/R loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions. The gene content and gene order within the fused MAT loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, and there is no apparent suppression of recombination extending from the MAT loci to adjacent chromosomal regions. This suggests different mechanisms for the evolution of physically linked MAT loci in these groups.
A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated Triatoma dimidiata, the primary vector of Chagas disease in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was fitted to two years of field data and accurately predicted vector abundance in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found to be effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season, resulting in an >80% reduction in bug abundance. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve control, and the effect decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. The study suggests that control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying due to the need for yearly application and accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative for controlling non-domiciliated vectors, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases. The findings of this study highlight the importance of optimizing current insecticide spraying strategies and investigating alternative control methods, such as insect screens or bednets, to effectively manage Chagas disease transmission in the region.
The patterning of feathers in avian skin is a complex process that relies on the interaction of multiple signalling pathways and cell density waves. During development, feathers first arise along the dorsal midline in a row, with new feather buds added sequentially in a spreading wave. This patterning is achieved through a coupled reaction-diffusion-taxis system involving fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signalling, as well as mesenchymal cell movement. The system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centred on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation and mechanically compresses the epidermis to rapidly intensify FGF20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A ( EDA ), which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. In flightless birds such as the emu and ostrich, the feather patterning system is disrupted, with the emu lacking sufficient cells to enact feather formation and the ostrich laying down feather primordia without a wave. This work demonstrates that a reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array in flighted birds. The EDA/Ectodysplasin A receptor ( EDAR ) pathway plays a key role in activating this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered pattern formation.
A rapid systematic review was conducted to investigate the presence and persistence of Ebola and Marburg viruses in patients and survivors. The review included 33 studies that reported on the detection of filoviruses in human body fluids. The majority of studies focused on Zaire Ebola, with fewer studies on Marburg virus and Sudan, Taï Forest, and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. The review found that most body fluid types had insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and the prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken more than 16 days after the onset of illness were usually negative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for filovirus RNA yielded positive results about four times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was detected in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every confirmed patient. Non-blood, RT-PCR-positive samples are likely to be culture-negative and possibly of low infectious risk. However, the infectious risk of many body fluids during or after illness is unclear, even when culture-positive, due to the majority of test results coming from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the primary risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood. The review highlights the need for further research to determine the infectious risk of various body fluids during and after illness.
A new fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model has been developed to describe neuronal spike timing adaptation. This model incorporates a fractional derivative to capture power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity. The fractional derivative represents a non-local process where the value of the variable is determined by integrating a temporal weighted voltage trace, also known as the memory trace. The model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found experimentally in neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons in vitro by varying the exponent of the fractional derivative. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the voltage trace increase, causing the value of the voltage to be increasingly correlated with the trajectory of the voltage in the past. The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with a power-law distribution. The fractional model generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input and deviates from the spiking activity of the Markovian model, reflecting the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation. The model provides a unified mathematical and computational framework for describing power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity, capturing relationships between the distribution of conductances that can be complicated to model using explicit techniques. The fractional model exhibits spike adaptation with power-law dynamics by integrating all past voltage values without additional adaptation currents.
The study investigated the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) isoforms in the pathogenesis of Paracoccidioides spp., a genus of fungal pathogens that causes paracoccidioidomycosis. The researchers identified six SODs isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and analyzed their expression levels in different stages of the fungal life cycle, including yeast and mycelia cells, as well as during interaction with host effector cells. The study found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 were highly expressed during the transition from yeast to mycelia, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells, suggesting that these proteins play a crucial role in combating superoxide radicals generated during host-pathogen interaction. Using knockdown strains, the researchers demonstrated that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the response of the fungus against host effector cells, particularly the oxidative stress response. Protein sequence analysis and functional analysis of knockdown strains suggested that PbSOD3 has a pronounced extracellular activity, while PbSOD1 is more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus. The study also showed that Paracoccidioides actively responds to endogenously generated radicals and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms. These findings provide new insights into the antioxidant response of Paracoccidioides spp. and highlight the importance of SODs in the pathogenesis of paracoccidioidomycosis.
The study investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaperone binding in various organisms, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. Contrary to the expectation that IDPs would be preferentially associated with chaperones to protect against proteolysis, the analysis revealed a negative correlation between predicted disorder and chaperone binding. This means that IDPs tend to avoid binding to chaperones in vivo. The study used high-throughput interaction data and the IUPred algorithm to predict protein disorder and analyze its relationship with chaperone binding. The results showed that proteins with predicted disorder were less likely to bind chaperones, and this effect was observed across different taxonomic groups. Furthermore, the study found that chaperone-binding proteins were more likely to have globular domains, suggesting that chaperone binding is primarily required for the folding of globular proteins. In contrast, IDPs that bind chaperones tend to bind other proteins as well, suggesting that chaperone binding promotes assembly with partners rather than assisting in protein folding. Overall, the study provides evidence that IDPs do not require chaperone binding for protection against proteolysis and instead use chaperones to facilitate interactions with other proteins.
The Drosophila melanogaster genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr) encode Zn-finger transcription factors regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signalling pathway in the wing imaginal disc. These genes are essential for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the wing disc and vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of growth and patterning of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc by the Dpp pathway, researchers identified direct Salm and Salr target genes by comparing the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs in microarray experiments. In situ hybridization revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins in the wing disc. Candidate Salm/Salr targets include genes whose expression is turned off and genes whose expression is positively regulated by Salm/Salr. Loss-of-function phenotypic analysis of these genes indicates that a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patterning. The identification and analysis of candidate Salm/Salr target genes provide a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of this epithelial tissue. The study reveals an unsuspected complexity in the transcriptional landscape regulated by Salm/Salr, consisting of batteries of activated and repressed genes. This work aims to reconstruct the genetic cascade initiated by Dpp signalling that acts through the Spalt transcription factors to control the growth and patterning of the central region of the wing disc.
The regulation of centriole duplication is crucial for maintaining proper cell division and preventing tumorigenesis and microcephaly. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the C. elegans homolog of Plk4, ZYG-1, is required for centriole duplication. However, the regulation of ZYG-1 levels remains poorly understood. This study identifies the two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22 as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. Down-regulation of PP1 activity either directly or through mutation of szy-2 or sds-22 rescues the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele by increasing ZYG-1 levels. The results indicate that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication in a zyg-1 mutant, but strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification. The study defines a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle. The data suggest that PP1, I-2SZY-2, and SDS-22 cooperate to regulate overall cellular levels of ZYG-1. Down-regulation of PP1 activity leads to accumulation of excess ZYG-1, resulting in centriole over-duplication in embryos expressing a wild-type version of ZYG-1.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease that has been expanding rapidly, with increasing urbanization and environmental changes facilitating contact between wildlife, humans, and their pets. In southeastern Brazil, the municipality of Campinas reported its first autochthonous case of VL in 2009 in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium within an environmentally protected area (EPA). Since then, disease transmission has remained restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular tools and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified, including two specimens of Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of Leishmania infantum in Brazil. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola, as well as in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. The study suggests that the EPA, inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus, and the risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios is evident. The findings highlight the need for different epidemiological profiles of VL to be included in prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.
The Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded MicroRNA MiR-BART9 Promotes Tumor Metastasis by Targeting E-Cadherin in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is an oncogenic virus associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ), a highly metastatic tumor frequently reported in South Asia. EBV-encoded microRNAs ( miRNAs ), such as miR-BART9, play critical roles in regulating cellular processes and directing viral life cycles. This study investigated the effect of miR-BART9 on NPC cells using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. The results showed that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of cultured NPC cells and enhances metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that miR-BART9 targets E-cadherin, a membrane protein crucial for cell-cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical assays and functional rescue analysis confirmed that miR-BART9 specifically inhibits E-cadherin to induce a mesenchymal-like phenotype and promote NPC cell migration. The study suggests that high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells. The findings indicate that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA that drives epithelial carcinoma cells to adopt a mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced motility, contributing to the highly metastatic behavior of NPC tumors. The study highlights the significance of miR-BART9 as a viral contributor to the migratory and invasive capability of EBV-infected tumor cells.
ggsashimi is a command-line tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple RNA-seq samples. It generates sashimi plots for individual experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. ggsashimi uses popular bioinformatics file formats and is annotation-independent, allowing for the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites. The tool is implemented in Python and generates R code for plotting. ggsashimi addresses limitations of existing sashimi plot implementations, including the need for specialized annotation formats and the inability to support summarized views for hundreds of samples. In contrast to existing tools, ggsashimi allows for the aggregation of samples belonging to the same group and the shrinkage of intron lengths, enhancing the visualization of splicing events. A comparison of ggsashimi with the sashimi-plot built-in available within the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) Browser shows that ggsashimi provides a more effective visualization of splicing events, particularly for large genomic regions. ggsashimi is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi.
Title: Alignment and Prediction of cis-Regulatory Modules Based on a Probabilistic Model of Evolution
    Abstract: Cross-species comparison has emerged as a powerful paradigm for predicting cis-regulatory modules ( CRMs ) and understanding their evolution. The comparison requires reliable sequence alignment, which remains a challenging task for less conserved noncoding sequences. Furthermore, the existing models of DNA sequence evolution generally do not explicitly treat the special properties of CRM sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a model of CRM evolution that captures different modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites ( TFBSs ) and the background sequences. A particularly novel aspect of our work is a probabilistic model of gains and losses of TFBSs, a process being recognized as an important part of regulatory sequence evolution. We present a computational framework that uses this model to solve the problems of CRM alignment and prediction. Our alignment method is similar to existing methods of statistical alignment but uses the conserved binding sites to improve alignment. Our CRM prediction method deals with the inherent uncertainties of binding site annotations and sequence alignment in a probabilistic framework. In simulated as well as real data, we demonstrate that our program is able to improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we used alignments produced by our program to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, with two intriguing results: ( i ) the factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm and ( ii ) binding sites in distal bound sequences ( relative to transcription start sites ) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. Our approach is implemented as software, EMMA ( Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis ), ready to be applied in a broad biological context. Supporting Text: Models that describe one or more aspect of regulatory sequence evolution have been proposed recently [25]–[31], but none of these methods offers a complete evolutionary model of CRM sequences that can be directly used for bioinformatic tasks such as CRM alignment and prediction. Finally, we note that none of the above models integrates the binding site evolution model with the model of insertions and deletions, a feature that is essential to simultaneous alignment and regulatory sequence inference. Our model is also an extension of statistical alignment ( reviewed in [22] ) to the analysis of cis-regulatory sequences. Our work, especially its alignment functionality, belonging to the category of statistical alignment; however, it is designed specifically for the alignment of cis-regulatory modules. Thus the modeling of substitution and indels, the characteristic feature of statistical alignment, has to be integrated with a model-based treatment of binding site evolution. It aligns regulatory sequences by taking advantage of the tendency of conservation of TFBSs. The TFBS gain and loss model allows us to use information present in lineage-specific TFBSs. Most importantly, when used for predicting CRMs, our method treats alignment and annotation of TFBSs as random variables, summing over them and thus minimizing the impact of an uncertain alignment and TFBS annotation. We have proposed an integrative framework for cross-species analysis of cis-regulatory sequences. At the heart of our approach is a probabilistic model covering important aspects of CRM evolution, including substitutions and indels in background sequences, and constraints and turnover of TFBSs. The dynamic programming algorithm allows us to efficiently carry out likelihood-based statistical inference. This framework solves the problems of the existing approaches discussed earlier.
The piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway plays a crucial role in silencing transposons in the germline of Drosophila, but its functions during development are not well understood. This study investigates the role of the piRNA pathway in genome maintenance and telomere protection during embryonic development. Mutations in the piRNA pathway genes armi, aub, ago3, and rhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during the cleavage stage of embryonic divisions. Additionally, aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere resolution during meiosis and the cleavage divisions, while mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homologous end joining, suppress these fusions but enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduce expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. In contrast, mutations in rhi and ago3 do not block HOAP binding or production of these piRNAs. These findings uncover genetically separable functions for the Drosophila piRNA pathway, with aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 genes silencing transposons and maintaining chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions, and aub and armi having an additional function in assembly of the telomere protection complex. The study reveals a novel function for a subset of piRNA genes in assembly of the telomere protection complex and suggests that this process is directed by a subpopulation of 19–22 nt piRNAs.
A new ebolavirus species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, has been identified as the cause of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda. The outbreak, which occurred in November 2007, resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. This newly discovered virus is most closely related to Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, despite the large geographic distance between the two countries of origin. The sequence divergence of Bundibugyo ebolavirus from previously recognized ebolaviruses, including Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, has significant implications for the development of diagnostic assays, antivirals, and vaccines. Current human prototype ebolavirus vaccines, which include Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, may not provide cross-protection against Bundibugyo ebolavirus, highlighting the need for cross-protection studies. The pathogenicity of Bundibugyo ebolavirus is lower than that of Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36% compared to 80-90% and 50-55%, respectively. Studies in non-human primates are necessary to compare the pathogenicity of these viruses. The rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases in the affected area were facilitated by the transfer of antigen-capture, IgM, IgG, and real-time PCR assays to the Uganda Virus Research Institute during the outbreak.
Title: High Degree of Heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s Disease Progression Patterns

    Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients exhibit varying rates of progression, but a quantitative study of this heterogeneity has been lacking. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) characterize seven stages of AD, from normal aging to severe dementia, with published mean durations but unknown variances. A cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years was analyzed to reconstruct GDS/FAST stage durations. Calculations for stages 4-6 revealed that standard deviations for stage durations are comparable to their mean values, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. This heterogeneity is consistent with the existence of several sub-groups of AD patients with distinct patterns of decline.

    A longitudinal dataset analysis showed significant variation in the lengths of GDS/FAST stages 4-6, with standard deviations similar to mean durations. This suggests that cognitive and functional decline patterns vary significantly from patient to patient, supporting the notion that AD is a heterogeneous disease. The temporal progression of AD exhibits high variability, with patients transitioning through stages at different rates, ranging from months to decades. The underlying reasons for this variability remain uncertain, but it is plausible that multiple factors contribute to the high variability of AD progression rates. The study’s findings are consistent with previous reports and provide new insights into the patterns of AD progression.
The Role of Additive Neurogenesis and Synaptic Plasticity in a Hippocampal Memory Model with Grid-Cell Like Input
    This study extends a previous model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. The model compares network performance across a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. The results confirm that additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. A more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells is shown to have an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. This adaptation rule can be tailored to maximize performance of the network when operating as either a short- or long-term memory store. The study also examines the time course of adult neurogenesis over the lifetime of an animal raised under different hypothetical rearing conditions, providing a theoretical prediction that could be tested experimentally. Place cells can emerge and refine in a realistic manner in the model as a direct result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer. The results provide strong theoretical arguments for why additive neurogenesis should be observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, as it endows the network with the ability to adapt in a way that is not possible with conventional plasticity or neuronal turnover.
In bloodstream African trypanosomes, cytosolic peroxidases play a crucial role in protecting the lysosome from iron-mediated membrane damage. The parasites express three virtually identical non-selenium glutathione peroxidase ( Px ) -type enzymes in the cytosol ( Px I–II ) and mitochondrion ( Px III ). While Px III is dispensable for parasitism, Px I and Px II are essential for protecting the lysosome from oxidative damage. In the absence of these enzymes, parasites undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and cell lysis, which can be rescued by supplementing the medium with the α-tocopherol derivative Trolox. The lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage, and its disintegration precedes mitochondrial damage. The parasites acquire iron by endocytosis of host transferrin, and supplementing the medium with iron or transferrin induces lysis of Px I–II knockout cells, while the iron chelator deferoxamine and apo-transferrin attenuate lysis. The high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei are closely linked to the rapid lethal phenotype of Px I–II knockout cells. In contrast, the procyclic insect form of the parasite is fully viable in Trolox-free medium. These findings demonstrate that cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases protect the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation in bloodstream African trypanosomes.
Inactivation of the Pmel gene, which encodes an amyloidogenic protein involved in melanosome formation, results in spherical melanosomes and a mild effect on visible pigmentation in mice. Mice lacking the Pmel gene (Pmel−/−) are viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. However, they exhibit reduced eumelanin content in hair, indicating a critical role for PMEL in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation. Melanosomes in Pmel−/− melanocytes are spherical in contrast to the oblong shape present in wild-type animals, observed in primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelium cells, and uveal melanocytes. The inactivation of Pmel has a mild effect on coat color phenotype in four different genetic backgrounds, with the most pronounced effect observed in mice carrying the brown/Tyrp1 mutation. This phenotype is similar to that observed with the spontaneous silver mutation in mice, suggesting that previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation are likely dominant-negative mutations. The study demonstrates that PMEL is essential for the normal development of rod-shaped melanosomes in eumelanin-producing melanocytes, but not for the general survival of pigment cells in several tissues.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of environmental methods for dengue vector control was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. The review included 19 studies, with 16 contributing data to the meta-analysis. The quality of the studies was assessed using the CONSORT 2010 checklist, with container covers with insecticides showing the highest quality. The meta-analysis showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. However, container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions for the Breteau index, while container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects for the pupae per person index. The results suggest that environmental interventions can be effective in controlling the immature stages of Aedes sp. mosquitoes, with each method showing some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities. However, the quality of the studies was a major issue, with most studies assessed as low or medium quality, and there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence. The findings of this review highlight the potential of environmental methods as a sustainable and safe approach to dengue vector control.
Scientists have identified small molecules that selectively inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome, a crucial step in the development of new therapeutics. One such compound, PF-06378503 (PF8503), has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in preclinical models by inhibiting the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of cholesterol levels. However, the impact of PF8503 on cellular physiology and ribosome quality control pathways was unknown. To investigate this, a genome-wide CRISPRi screen was conducted to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503. The screen revealed that the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3 bind to the ribosome and protect cells from the toxic effects of PF8503. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments showed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2 and functions downstream of HBS1L. These findings provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease. Ribosome profiling revealed that PF8503 inhibits translation of an overlapping set of proteins compared to a related compound, PF846, along with a distinct set of off-target proteins. The study highlights the importance of ribosome quality control pathways in modulating the effects of translation stalling compounds.
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) induces widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to evade immune detection and block host gene expression. The viral protein SOX is responsible for this phenotype, but its mechanism of action remained unknown due to its lack of intrinsic ribonuclease activity. This study reveals that SOX stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover through a novel mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. Transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. This study demonstrates that KSHV SOX-induced host shutoff is linked to mRNA polyadenylation, a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a new model system to probe the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The findings suggest that SOX-induced alterations in mRNA processing events may render nascent RNAs targets of cellular quality control machinery, and that polyadenylation plays an integral role in SOX-mediated mRNA turnover.
Bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induce the production of type III interferon (IFNλ) in the lung, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. The IFNλ receptor, IL-28R, is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract and is essential for host defense against some viral pathogens. However, its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens has not been well understood. Research has shown that IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting the microRNA miR-21, leading to the upregulation of PDCD4, a protein that promotes inflammatory signaling. Mice lacking the IL-28R or PDCD4 had improved clearance of bacterial pathogens and reduced lung pathology compared to wild-type mice. In human epithelial cells, IFNλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT3, resulting in the upregulation of PDCD4. In vivo, 18 hours after infection, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild-type mice compared to IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with Staphylococcus aureus resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production. These findings suggest that IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4 during bacterial pneumonia. The study highlights the importance of the IFNλ/IL-28R/PDCD4 pathway in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
Mortality trends and risk factors in advanced stage-2 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) were investigated in a retrospective study of 781 naïve cases admitted to the National Reference Center for Human African Trypanosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The study aimed to identify predictors of death and assess the effectiveness of different treatment regimens. Death proportions were 17.2% in the standard melarsoprol schedule, 12.1% in the short schedule melarsoprol, 5.4% in the first-line eflornithine regimen, 9.1% in the NECT treatment regimen, and 36% in the group treated with eflornithine due to severe clinical status. After adjusting for treatment, death odds ratios were significantly associated with clinical dysfunction on admission (10.40), high protidorachy (2.14), presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid (1.99), and high cytorachy (1.70). A multivariable analysis within treatment groups retained clinical status on admission and high protidorachy as significant predictors of death. The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in assessing disease severity and the need for an objective test to evaluate HAT clinical severity. The findings suggest that clinical status on admission and protidorachy are critical factors in determining mortality in advanced stage-2 HAT. The study's algorithm for initial clinical status assessment may serve as a basis for developing standardized assessment tools for HAT management and epidemiological reports.
A novel computer vision pipeline was developed to study the effects of isolation on social interaction dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster. The pipeline consists of a new imaging arena and an improved tracking algorithm that allows for the simultaneous tracking of a large number of flies. Automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis were used to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. The results showed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. Genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes were explored and found that gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one, primarily in metabolic genes. Metabolic changes were verified by an increase in lipid content in isolated flies. Behavioral changes due to isolation were found to be long-lasting, while changes in gene expression levels were transient. The study suggests that flies alter their physiology and behavior to promote social interactions with neighboring flies after only a single day of isolation. The individual fly parameter of walking distance was found to change early and persistently in response to isolation. This study provides a reliable toolset for studying the effects of isolation on group behavior, including molecular and genetic analysis, and individual and grouped physiological and behavioral analysis in Drosophila melanogaster.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines on clinical guideline adherence in resource-limited settings. The study took place in a district and sub-district hospital during the fall 2015 cholera season, where both hospitals lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, with 325 in the pre-intervention group and 516 in the intervention group. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both hospitals, with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased at both hospitals, with RRs of 6.9 and 1.6, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased. Zinc adherence also increased. These findings demonstrate that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence. The study identified opportunities to improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. The results support the hypothesis that technology-enabled decision-support tools can promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings.
The article presents empirical evidence that the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) can effectively describe the temperature dependency of within-host parasite dynamics. The study used experimental data from Daphnia magna and its natural microsporidian parasite, Ordospora colligata, to examine the effects of temperature on host and parasite traits, their interactions, and the within-host parasite population dynamics. A mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics was fitted to the data, incorporating MTE-based relationships for host aging and mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance. The model accurately predicted host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across a range of temperatures, using fewer parameters than traditional discrete temperature modeling approaches. The results demonstrate the potential of linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. This approach provides a valuable tool for understanding the impacts of climate change on host-parasite interactions and disease dynamics. The study's findings support the use of MTE-based thermal relationships to inform classical models of host-parasite dynamics and estimate the net effect of temperature changes on disease prevalence and severity. The simplicity and generality of this framework make it a useful approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections in light of climate change.
The redistribution of somato-dendritic inhibition by GABAergic interneurons plays a crucial role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells ( PCs ). However, the contribution of various inhibitory cell types to neuronal information processing is not fully understood. This study proposes a functional role for a network motif consisting of parvalbumin- ( PV ), somatostatin- ( SOM ), and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) -expressing interneurons. PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, while mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. A computational model demonstrates that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. The study also shows that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled. The findings suggest that the interplay between PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons acts as an amplifier that translates weak input onto VIP cells into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs. This amplification is supported by mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons, which enables switch-like spatial shifts of somato-dendritic inhibition.
Microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples to link specific microbes to host phenotypes, such as disease. However, abundance differences can reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. A study found that microbial interactions can generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, the researchers developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The method, called Direct Association Analysis (DAA), corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD. The study suggests that realistic microbial interactions produce a large number of spurious associations between particular members of the microbiome and phenotypes, which can be removed by a simple procedure based on maximum entropy models. The findings have implications for the interpretation of MWAS results and highlight the need to consider microbial interactions when studying the relationship between microbiota and host phenotypes.
This study compared the effect of Wolbachia infection on the replication and transmission of dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using two different infection models: stable transinfected and transiently infected mosquitoes. The results showed that Wolbachia had a similar blocking effect on both viruses in both infection models, but the magnitude of the blocking effect was significantly lower in mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbachia. Notably, no evidence was found for any enhancement of DENV or WNV (Kunjin strain) infection in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia, suggesting that Wolbachia may be an effective and safe means for restricting transmission of these viruses. The study also found that Wolbachia density was lower in transiently infected mosquitoes compared to stably infected mosquitoes, which may explain the reduced DENV blocking phenotype observed in the transiently infected mosquitoes. The results of this study support the use of Wolbachia as a potential tool for controlling the spread of DENV and WNV, and highlight the importance of considering the host-Wolbachia interaction and the model of infection when studying the effect of Wolbachia on pathogen replication and transmission.
In C. elegans, the cilia shafts of amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtubule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet-based region adjacent to the transition zone (TZ) and a distal singlet-based region. This study investigated the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans ciliary doublet region and the Inversin compartment (InvC). The results show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. The nphp-2 gene, the C. elegans Inversin homolog, and the doublet region genes arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis. These genes can be sorted into two modules: nphp-2+klp-11 and arl-13+unc-119, which are antagonized by the hdac-6 deacetylase. The genes of this network modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components, but is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. The ciliary targeting and restricted localization of NPHP-2, ARL-13, and UNC-119 do not require TZ-, doublet region-, and InvC-associated genes. NPHP-2 requires its calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC. The study concludes that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
The polarity protein Scribble plays a crucial role in regulating myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes, where it is localized to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. Conditional elimination of Scribble expression in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice also disrupts myelin initiation in the CNS, both during development and following focal demyelination. Furthermore, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness and suppresses the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway. Scribble localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the evolutionarily-conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination. The study suggests that Scribble function is compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at sites of radial or longitudinal growth, and that it plays a critical role in myelin regeneration. The results also indicate that Scribble is restricted to non-compact myelin membranes, and its localization is consistent with a possible role in regulating axo-glial adhesion.
A novel peptide haemolysin, Listeriolysin S, has been identified in a subset of Lineage I Listeria monocytogenes strains. These strains are responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Listeriolysin S is a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor that contributes to the virulence of the pathogen, as demonstrated in murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. The gene cluster encoding Listeriolysin S is inducible and strain-variable, being present in a subset of isolates from Lineage I. In silico analysis reveals that gene clusters potentially encoding Sls-like factors are also present in other notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The biosynthetic enzymes SagBCD, responsible for Listeriolysin S production, function analogously to the microcin B17 modification machinery, McbBCD. The discovery of Listeriolysin S expands the family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs) and sheds light on the genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of Lineage I L. monocytogenes strains. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of several important Gram-positive pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and C. botulinum.
The study investigated the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granulomas caused by different causative agents. Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains, surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. Immunohistochemical analysis of surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma revealed that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III. Notably, MMP-9 expression was higher in Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. A positive correlation was observed between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels (p = 0.001). The study also found that MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to disease duration (p < 0.001). However, no significant correlation was found between IL-17 levels and patients' demographic characteristics. The results suggest that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in mycetoma granulomas and that their expression may be related to the severity of the disease. Further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL-17 and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and to provide insights into mycetoma immunopathogenesis.
The study investigated the molecular recognition mechanism of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EAD), an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that exhibits features of "fuzziness". Fuzziness is characterized by polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The researchers hypothesized that EAD-target binding involves polycation-π interactions between the disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. To test this hypothesis, they evaluated the effects of EAD sequence variations on binding activity and developed a coarse-grained EAD chain model and an analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of a generic globular target. The results support the cation-π model and suggest that EAD-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. The study provides a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs, which are implicated in various diseases including cancer. The findings have implications for understanding the physical basis of molecular recognition by IDPs and the role of cation-π interactions in protein-protein interactions.
The study investigated the functional roles of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Previous research had shown that Lon-1 is upregulated in response to blood exposure in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in their substrate binding domains, suggesting distinct substrate specificities. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro but failed to complement an Escherichia coli Lon mutant. In contrast, Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. These findings indicate that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles in B. burgdorferi. Lon-2 appears to function similarly to the canonical Lon protease, involved in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, on the other hand, may play a role in host adaptation, particularly during the transition from an arthropod to a warm-blooded host. This is supported by its upregulation in response to blood exposure and its unique presence in the Borrelia genus. The study suggests that Lon-1 may be involved in the remodeling of the spirochete outer surface during a blood meal in the tick. Overall, the results highlight the distinct functional roles of Lon-1 and Lon-2 in B. burgdorferi and their potential importance in the bacterium's life cycle.
The study investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. Fc gamma receptor (FcyR)-mediated antibody functions, including ADP, are thought to play a crucial role in controlling other viral infections. The researchers measured the ability of HIV-specific antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. Surprisingly, they found minimal or no ADP of virions with any of the antibodies tested. However, after coating virions with gp41 or gp41-derived peptides, gp41-specific monoclonal antibodies efficiently mediated phagocytosis. The study also found that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed. In contrast, virion-decorated cells were targets for ADP or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The findings suggest that ADP of virions may not play a role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcyRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection. The study's results also suggest that FcγR-dependent functions other than ADP of free virions may be critical for maximal prevention or control of HIV-1 infection by antibody.
The global economic and health burden of human hookworm infection has been estimated using a computational simulation model. According to the study, hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2016, using 2004 disability weight estimates, and 4,087,803 DALYs, using 2010 disability weight estimates, excluding cognitive impairment outcomes. The total productivity losses ranged from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually, using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages, and from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion, using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages. The study found that the economic and health burden of hookworm infection exceeded published estimates for several diseases that have received more attention, such as rotavirus. The revised Global Burden of Disease study for 2010 reported 3,230,800 DALYs annually due to hookworm among all ages in 21 regions, including disability weights for additional hookworm outcomes and stratified by level of anemia. The study also found that certain large countries transitioning to higher income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden. The global burden of hookworm infection was estimated to be $11.1 billion using a median likelihood of anemia, 2004 disability weight estimates, and gross national income per capita.
This study investigated the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding in the developing vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model organism, the researchers found that developmental hypoxia disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons, leading to errors in commissural axon crossing. The pathfinding defects were caused by activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1) pathway and were mimicked by chemical inducers of the HIF1 pathway or by expression of constitutively active HIF1α. The researchers identified ephrinB2a as a target of HIF1 pathway activation and showed that knockdown of ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors. EphrinB2a was found to mediate the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, was found to protect against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. The study demonstrates that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and supports a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium. The findings suggest that hypoxia can specifically disrupt vertebrate axon pathfinding and that ephrinB2a is a primary mediator of HIF1 pathway activation.
This study investigated pulmonary abnormalities in mice infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathological analysis. Male BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with P. brasiliensis conidia or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as controls. HRCT scans were performed every four weeks to assess pulmonary lesions, lung density, and air structure, while histopathology and histomorphometry were used to analyze lung tissue. Three distinct patterns of lesions were identified: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. Lesions were predominantly located around the hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. At four weeks post-infection, HRCT revealed peri-bronchial consolidations and increased upper lung density in 80% of infected mice compared to controls. By eight and 12 weeks, consolidation progressed to involve middle lung regions. Histopathology confirmed that HRCT-detected consolidations corresponded to confluent granulomatous reactions, while nodules represented individual compact granulomas. By 16 weeks, confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi. Discrete focal fibrosis was visible around granulomas by histopathology but not by HRCT. This study demonstrates the utility of conventional HRCT in evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental PCM, reducing the need for animal sacrifice and providing a more rational approach to studying human lung disease.
Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (Modified QuantiFERON) as a Potential Marker of Infection for Leishmania donovani: A Proof of Concept Study
    A proof-of-concept study investigated the use of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) as a novel marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection. The study modified a commercial QuantiFERON kit to evaluate five different Leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA), and soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). The assay was tested on venous blood samples from 13 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, 15 cured VL patients, 11 non-endemic healthy controls, and 19 healthy endemic controls. The results showed that the SLA-based QuantiFERON assay had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI = 54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100% (95% CI = 74.12-100) in detecting the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The study found a positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with Leishmania antigen in patients with active VL, which contradicts the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The highest IFN-γ response was observed with the SLA antigen, with 84.6% of active VL patients showing a positive response. The study suggests that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection.
The CNFY toxin plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis by enhancing the translocation of antiphagocytic Yop effectors and inducing inflammatory responses that lead to tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. However, suppression of CNFY function results in increased interferon-γ-mediated responses, which comprise non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, giving the bacteria a fitness edge against host responses and facilitating the establishment of a commensal-type lifestyle. The removal of CNFY toxin is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade the host's immune defense, favoring the establishment of Yersinia persistence. The CNFY-triggered process represents a double-edged sword, where the precise mechanisms that dampen inflammation and allow establishment of Yersinia-persistence are still unclear. The overall impact of CNFY suggests a set of immune responses, including differential levels of IL-6, immune modulators, bacteriocidal activities, and anti-inflammatory factors, which may contribute to this process. Suppression of CNFY function shifts the balance of bacteria-triggered inflammation and clearance mechanisms towards induction of immune suppression, promoting the establishment of asymptomatic, persistent infection.
A novel pathogenicity gene, DES1, has been identified in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which plays a crucial role in suppressing the basal defenses of the host plant. The DES1 gene was discovered by screening for pathogenicity-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional mutant library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, and its homologs are conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted gene deletion of DES1 did not affect developmental morphogenesis, including vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, and appressorium-mediated penetration. However, the Δdes1 mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress and exhibited decreased activity and transcription levels of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases. In addition, ferrous ion leakage was observed in the Δdes1 mutant. When interacting with a susceptible rice cultivar, rice cells inoculated with the Δdes1 mutant displayed strong defense responses, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. The Δdes1 mutant showed a significant reduction in infectious hyphal extension and pathogenicity. Treatment with diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, suppressed ROS generation and reduced defense responses in plant tissues challenged with the Δdes1 mutant. Furthermore, the Δdes1 mutant recovered its normal infectious growth in DPI-treated plant tissues. These results suggest that DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense.
Biomedical researchers evaluated the accuracy of model-based geostatistics (MBG) predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana by comparing them with empiric prevalence values obtained from school surveys at 79 sites. The results showed that using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined ‘high-risk’ schools requiring yearly praziquantel treatment would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This translates to 28% of the children in the 79 schools being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in the absence of any demonstrated need. The study suggests that using the current predictive map for Ghana as a spatial decision support tool by aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level is not adequate for guiding the national program. However, the alternative of assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible. The researchers propose that predictive risk mapping should be an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers. The study highlights the importance of improving the understanding of the most appropriate way to use predictive risk maps to guide treatment delivery decisions, assessment techniques, and modelling approaches to schistosomiasis.
A heterogeneous mixture of F-series prostaglandins promotes sperm guidance in the Caenorhabditis elegans reproductive tract. These prostaglandins are synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes by Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. Genetics and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry were used to partially delineate F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways. The results show that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins, which function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PUFA synthesis triggers compensatory up-regulation of prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. F-series prostaglandin synthesis in Caenorhabditis elegans involves biochemical mechanisms distinct from those in mammalian cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways, yet PGF2α stereoisomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bietti's Crystalline Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. The results support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. This cyclooxygenase-independent pathway for F-series synthesis may be conserved. The study identifies a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that functions to inhibit prostaglandin metabolism, possibly by diverting their precursors into an alternative pathway. The results suggest that Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes secrete a blend of F-series prostaglandins for guiding sperm to the fertilization site.
The development of biotherapeutics is often hindered by their immunogenic potential, which can lead to reduced efficacy and increased risk of adverse reactions. To address this issue, researchers have developed algorithms that optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. An in silico analysis of this dual objective design space revealed that there is no single global optimum for protein deimmunization, but rather a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, which represents the undominated variants that exhibit better performance in both criteria. The Pareto frontier of a therapeutic enzyme was designed, constructed, and evaluated experimentally, and various measures of protein performance were found to map a functional sequence space that correlated well with computational predictions. Eighteen Pareto optimal variants were produced and subjected to a rigorous experimental analysis of key performance parameters, providing new insights into the inherent tradeoffs linking the target enzyme's sequence, function, and immunogenic potential. This work outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmunization of biotherapeutic candidates, which may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts. The results demonstrate that incremental deletion of T cell epitopes leads to a relative escalation in concomitant loss of function, highlighting the need for a global approach to protein deimmunization that considers the combined effects of all mutations on immunogenicity and function.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, elevated temperature has been found to increase the frequency of meiotic crossovers (COs), which are essential for proper chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction. COs occur when homologous chromosomes exchange DNA, and their frequency and distribution are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The study demonstrates that heat-induced hyper-recombination is mediated by the Type I meiotic recombination pathway, which is sensitive to interference. This pathway is distinct from the Type II pathway, which is insensitive to interference. The research employed a pollen-based visual assay to show that thermal stress-induced COs are generated by the Type I pathway and act additively with Type II pathway perturbations, resulting in an enhanced hyper-recombination phenotype. Furthermore, the study found that the increase in meiotic CO frequency in response to temperature is not a universal response to stress and cannot be replicated by other factors, such as salt stress. The findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may have practical applications in plant breeding. The study suggests that temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic CO frequency could aid plant breeding without editing the genome or requiring mutant backgrounds. However, the observed reduction in pollen viability at high temperatures may necessitate the use of more modest temperature increases.
Biomedical researchers face a significant challenge in navigating the vast and rapidly evolving scientific literature, particularly in molecular biomedicine. To address this challenge, a novel computational approach has been developed, which combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. This approach, called the Hanalyzer, extracts information from external resources, tracks knowledge provenance, and enriches the knowledge by noting relationships between genes and calculating a combined reliability score. The Hanalyzer combines the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualizes the combined network in a tool that facilitates knowledge-based analysis. An implementation of the Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, resulting in the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development. These hypotheses were validated by further experimental work. The Hanalyzer also includes a Cytoscape plugin, CommonAttributes, which allows users to trace the provenance of links in the knowledge network and access underlying data sources and publications. The approach can be used to identify functional explanations of a gene list by exploiting inferences not available in individual data sources and to generate novel hypotheses by highlighting linkages in the data that are not well supported by existing knowledge.
The study investigated the surface molecules of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica and their role in internalisation by host cells. Using a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent, 380 surface proteins were identified on two EV sub-populations (15k and 120k EVs), including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis and trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 120k EVs originated from the parasite's endosomal system, while the 15k EVs were released from the gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the fluke gut. A lectin microarray strategy was used to profile the topology of major surface oligosaccharides on intact fluorogenically-labelled EVs, showing that the glycoconjugates exposed on the surface of the 15k and 120k EV sub-populations were identical but distinct from those on the parasite surface tegument. The EVs were resistant to exo- and endo-glycosidases, but treatment with the glyco-amidase PNGase F drastically remodelled the surface oligosaccharides and blocked EV uptake by host macrophages. In contrast, pre-treatment with antibodies against specific EV surface proteins (DM9-containing protein, CD63 receptor, and myoferlin) significantly enhanced EV internalisation by host cells. The study highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica and sheds light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells.
The study investigated the role of Arabidopsis CDF2 in the regulation of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. CDF2, a cycling DOF transcription factor, interacts with Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs. CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as a transcription activator or repressor, and preferentially binds to pri-miRNAs regulated by itself, affecting DCL1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. The study found that CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels to maintain proper levels of mature miRNAs, which is essential for plant development. CDF2 was also found to regulate the expressions of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, suggesting that it may affect miRNA biogenesis through regulating the levels of these components. The study implicated that CDF2 might regulate biogenesis of miRNAs indirectly by regulating the expressions of miRNA processing proteins in addition to its direct roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations of pri-miRNAs. Furthermore, the study found that CDF2 regulates the expressions of miR156 and miR172, two widely studied miRNAs, which are involved in flowering. The results suggest that CDF2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of miRNA biogenesis and plant development.
Folliculogenesis, a critical process for providing ova for reproductive life, relies on bidirectional communication between the oocyte and granulosa cells. This communication is essential for regulating granulosa cell proliferation and the transport of metabolites from granulosa cells to the oocyte for biosynthesis. However, the underlying mechanism of establishing this communication is not well understood. This study reveals that oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, plays a crucial role in establishing oocyte-granulosa cell communication. GGPP levels in oocytes increase during early follicular development, and its depletion impairs granulosa cell proliferation, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GGPP depletion inhibits Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation and its GTPase activity, leading to the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and failure to maintain physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells. Additionally, GGPP depletion blocks Rab27a geranylgeranylation, which may account for impaired secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. Furthermore, GGPP administration restores defects in oocyte-granulosa cell contact, granulosa cell proliferation, and primary-secondary follicle transition in Ggpps depletion mice. These findings demonstrate that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation contributes to the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and regulates primary-secondary follicle transition, a key phase of folliculogenesis essential for female reproductive function.
A structural model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation complex with a complete transcription bubble has been generated to investigate the routes of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry during transcription. The model was built by extending the DNA and nascent mRNA strands to 47 and 18 nucleotides in length, respectively, and was equilibrated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription, as the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Energetic studies based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels revealed that the diffusion of NTP through the main channel is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. The structural model of the Pol II elongation complex with a complete transcription bubble is crucial for understanding the NTP loading routes, as the non-template DNA part of the transcription bubble overlaps with the main channel and its conformation is absent in available crystal structures. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of Pol II transcription and highlight the importance of the secondary channel in NTP entry.
Dengue is a significant public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, particularly among children under 15 years of age. Although dengue is a reportable disease in both countries, the true burden of the disease is likely underestimated due to underreporting. To estimate the magnitude of underrecognition and establish more accurate disease burden estimates, researchers analyzed laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient dengue cases from prospective cohort studies in Thailand and Cambodia. The studies found that the average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1, 000 in Thailand and 41/1, 000 in Cambodia. Age-group specific multiplication factors ( MFs ) were calculated by comparing cohort study data to national surveillance data and ranged from 0. 4 to 29. These MFs were then applied to country-level reporting data to estimate the true number of dengue cases. The results indicated that in Thailand, a median of 229, 886 dengue cases occurred annually during 2003–2007, while in Cambodia, a median of 111, 178 cases occurred in children under 15 years of age. The average underrecognition of total and inpatient dengue cases was 8. 7 and 2. 6-fold in Thailand, and 9. 1 and 1. 4-fold in Cambodia, respectively. These findings suggest that national surveillance data significantly underrecognize the true burden of dengue disease. Calculating MFs by comparing prospective cohort study data to locally-reported national surveillance data is a useful approach to more accurately assess disease burden.
This study investigated the role of natural killer ( NK ) cells in promoting early CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) infection. The researchers used congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of specific defects in NK cell function on antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The results showed that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against MCMV infection in vivo by limiting interferon-alpha/beta ( IFN-α/β ) production to non-immunosuppressive levels. This is achieved through the early control of MCMV, which reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) for cytokine production, preserves conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs ), and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. In contrast, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. The study demonstrates that NK cell responses promote the accelerated generation of effector antiviral CD8 T cells during infection by preventing the generation of high, immunosuppressive levels of antiviral cytokines. The findings suggest that NK cells serve not only as effector lymphocytes but also as regulators of immune system function for defenses against viral infections. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of NK cells in promoting optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses and preventing innate cytokine shock.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression of 45S rRNA genes is tightly regulated, with only a subset of genes being transcribed under normal growth conditions. Researchers have identified four major rRNA gene variants in A. thaliana and found that disruption of the nucleolin-like protein gene ( Atnuc-L1 ) affects the expression of these variants. Specifically, one variant is induced, while the others are repressed or remain unaltered in Atnuc-L1 mutants. Notably, the most highly represented rRNA gene variant, which is normally inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in Atnuc-L1 mutants. The study shows that the accumulated pre-rRNAs in Atnuc-L1 mutants originate from RNA Polymerase I transcription and are processed accurately. Furthermore, disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene leads to a loss of symmetrical DNA methylation at rRNA genes without affecting histone epigenetic marks. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation, in which the nucleolin protein plays a crucial role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis. The study suggests that AtNUC-L1 binds to rRNA gene promoter sequences and directs rRNA transcription from the transcription initiation site. The results also indicate that AtNUC-L1 co-localizes with only approximately half of the rRNA loci in the nucleus of wild-type plants, suggesting that it may only associate with potentially transcriptionally active rRNA genes.
The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL29/28 protein interacts with components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which promotes the accumulation of immediate-early RNA. Histone deacetylation plays a crucial role in regulating HCMV gene expression. Using a rapid immunoisolation method coupled with mass spectrometry, candidate HDAC1-interacting proteins were identified, including HCMV-coded proteins pUL38 and pUL29/28. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations confirmed the interaction between pUL38 and pUL29/28 with HDAC1. HDAC1 is part of the NuRD complex, and pUL29/28 and pUL38 associated with the MTA2 component of NuRD. Knockdown of RBBP4 and CHD4 constituents of NuRD inhibited HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA accumulation, suggesting that multiple components of the NuRD complex are necessary for efficient HCMV replication. The growth of pUL29/28- or pUL38-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating infected cells with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Transient expression of pUL29/28 enhanced the activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, regardless of pUL38 expression. The induction of the major immediate-early reporter activity by pUL29/28 required functional NuRD components, consistent with the inhibition of immediate-early RNA accumulation after knockdown of RBBP4 and CHD4. These findings suggest that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of pneumonia in infants, and understanding the immune response to RSV infection is crucial for developing effective countermeasures. This study aimed to elucidate the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection in young children and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. Whole-genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (G) were used to profile infant sera prior to and following RSV infection. The results showed modest changes in the anti-F epitope repertoires post-RSV infection, while a 100-fold increase in the number of bound phages was observed for anti-G antibodies. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, along with increased reactivity to the central conserved domain (CCD). Panels of F and G antigenic sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from young children, adolescents, and adults in SPR real-time kinetics assays. A steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults was observed, with several novel epitopes identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. In contrast, antibody responses to RSV-G were high following early RSV infection in children but declined significantly in adults. These findings suggest unlinked evolution of anti-F and anti-G responses and provide evidence for immune pressure-driven evolution of RSV-G, which could inform the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines.
Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been shown to have potent macrofilaricidal effects against adult Brugia malayi, a species that causes lymphatic filariasis. Whole-parasite motility measurement and patch-clamp analysis revealed that emodepside inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown experiments suggested that the SLO-1 K channel is the target of emodepside. Further investigation using heterologously expressed slo-1 isoforms in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that the slo-1f isoform, found in male muscles, is more sensitive to emodepside than the slo-1a isoform found in female muscles. Selective RNAi of the slo-1a isoform in female worms increased emodepside potency. In silico modeling identified an emodepside binding pocket in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 channel, which is affected by alternative splicing in different species of filaria. The study highlights the importance of evaluating sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds to prevent under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes. Emodepside has completed first-in-human safety and tolerability studies and is being developed for the treatment of onchocerciasis, a disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The results of this study provide new insights into the mode of action of emodepside and its potential as a macrofilaricide.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where annual mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. However, Loa loa (Loiasis) cross-reactivity with LF RDTs has hindered LF elimination in Loiasis-endemic areas. To address this issue, researchers used the DH6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to Loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed many circulating AD12/DH6.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple L. loa proteins in LF RDT-positive Loiasis sera. These included both secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by dying L. loa adult worms and/or microfilariae. Unlike the single high molecular weight Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen present in the blood of persons with bancroftian filariasis, reactive L. loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with Loiasis. These differences can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and Loiasis. The study suggests that Loiasis cross-reactivity with W. bancrofti RDTs is due to the death of L. loa microfilariae and/or adult worms releasing multiple AD12 glycoproteins into circulation, and that an imbalance between release and clearance of these antigens accounts for their detection in the circulation of some Loiasis patients.
The study identifies a novel ciliary GTPase, RAB-28, associated with the BBSome and intraflagellar transport (IFT) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, the researchers discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161, CCDC-104, and RPI-1, which were confirmed to be cilium-localized in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, the study uncovered orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analysis of C. elegans RAB-28 revealed that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. The study found that inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localization, whereas GTP-bound RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses revealed that while cilium structure, sensory function, and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. The study presents a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveils RAB28 as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
The article presents a study on how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses from cells with stereotyped receptive fields. The researchers used hippocampal place cells as a model system to investigate what can be learned about a space of stimuli using only the action potentials (spikes) of these cells. The results show that one can extract global features of the environment and construct an accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale factor, that can be used to track the animal's position. This is achieved without knowing the place fields or any other functions relating neural responses to position. The study found that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space. This may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations. The researchers demonstrated that the simple knowledge of which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is enough to extract global topological features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space, including the animal's position within it. This can be done without prior knowledge of actual place fields or any other independent measurements of position. The study suggests that coarse features of population spiking activity can provide a great deal of information about a physical environment.
The study investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β in the pathogenesis of viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) in mice infected with the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3). The results showed that wild-type mice infected with MHV-3 exhibited severe disease and high mortality, accompanied by significant elevation of IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. In contrast, mice deficient in the IL-1β receptor (IL-1R1-/-) or treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. The study also found that IL-1R1 deficiency impaired the production of fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) in macrophages and reduced CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the liver. Furthermore, mice deficient in p47phox, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit, exhibited reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion during viral infection. Mice deficient in NLRP3 and Caspase-1, essential components of the inflammasome complex, also showed reduced IL-1β induction and ameliorated hepatitis. The study demonstrated that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral FH, suggesting that targeting this pathway may lead to the development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.
In a study conducted in Malawi, researchers used multiplex real-time PCR to investigate the association between hookworm infections and severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. The results showed that 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27.0% of non-severely anemic controls had hookworm infections, with a significantly higher prevalence of Ancylostoma duodenale (26.1%) compared to Necator americanus (4.9%). The study found that moderate and high-load A. duodenale infections were positively associated with severe anemia, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.49 and 9.04, respectively. Additionally, iron deficiency was positively associated with the intensity of A. duodenale infection, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.63, 16.98, and 44.91 for low, moderate, and high-load infections, respectively. The study highlights the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings. The results suggest that A. duodenale is a key factor in the etiology of severe anemia and iron deficiency in Malawian pre-school children, and that multiplex real-time PCR is a powerful diagnostic tool for public health research in this area. The study's findings have significant implications for the development of targeted interventions to address the burden of hookworm infections in sub-Saharan Africa.
During Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) can be repaired via homologous recombination ( HR ) or non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ). However, only HR can generate the interhomolog crossovers ( COs ) necessary for meiotic chromosome segregation. COM-1, the homolog of CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, is identified as a crucial regulator of DSB repair pathway choice during C. elegans gametogenesis. COM-1-deficient germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via the error-prone NHEJ pathway, resulting in a lack of COs, extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast to its yeast counterparts, COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but instead promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku. COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and safeguards timely CO formation. Both COM-1 and EXO-1 are dispensable for RAD-51 recruitment at the late pachytene stage, when homolog-independent repair pathways predominate. The study reveals the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identifies a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
This study investigated the humoral immune response of goats to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, after aerosol exposure. A caprine model of melioidosis was developed to characterize the immune response and identify immunogenic proteins for diagnostic and vaccine development. Outbred goats were infected with B. pseudomallei via intratracheal aerosol, and antigenic protein profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSHR511. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The results showed a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies compared to IgM antibodies throughout the course of the infection. Pre-infection sera showed reactivity to multiple immunogenic proteins, and after infection, the number of IgG reactive proteins increased as the disease progressed. Early-stage infection showed immune reaction to chaperone proteins GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK, which were detected in all serum samples after infection. The heat shock protein GroEL1 elicited the strongest goat antibody immune response compared to other antigens. An overall proteomic comparison between the goat model and human sera showed that many immune-reactive proteins are common between humans and goats with melioidosis. The study demonstrates that the B. pseudomallei aerosol challenge induced an increasing and diverse antibody response over the disease progress in the goats, and the results provide insights into the humoral response to B. pseudomallei in an experimental goat model for melioidosis.
The activation of cyclin B1–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is a crucial event that initiates mitotic entry in human cells. A positive feedback loop at the end of G2 phase triggers the activation of Cdk1, which is then inactivated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-dependent destruction of cyclin B1 in metaphase, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. However, the kinetics of Cdk1 activation during mitosis have been poorly understood. Using a novel approach, researchers have quantified the temporal development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in single cells by measuring dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and phosphorylation of the APC/C3 target. The results show that cyclin B1–Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation and that cytoplasmic cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. A model describing cyclin B1–Cdk1 activation in human cells reveals a bistable circuit, with distinct thresholds for cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity controlling successive mitotic events. The study proposes that gradually increasing cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. The findings suggest that mitotic cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity needs to further increase after mitotic entry and pass a threshold before metaphase to allow activation of the machinery required for efficient mitotic progression and initiation of mitotic exit.
The development of a neutralizing antibody (Nab)-based vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant challenge due to the virus's high genetic diversity. HIV-1 superinfection (SI), defined as sequential infections from different source partners, has been shown to lead to a broader and more potent Nab response compared to single infection. However, it is unclear whether SI impacts epitope specificity and whether the epitopes targeted after SI differ from those targeted after single infection. This study examined the post-SI Nab responses in 21 Kenyan women who were exposed to subtypes A, C, and D and superinfected after a median time of approximately 1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median time point of approximately 2.72 years post-SI. The study focused on four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, including the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. Using standard epitope mapping techniques, the study found that SI did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of these epitopes in the 21 women. Computational sera delineation analyses also suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women's Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These findings are consistent with a model in which SI with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, providing support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. The virus dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are essential for fetal brain development. Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a critical downstream effector of Notch signaling that regulates NPC fate and differentiation. In this study, researchers investigated the effect of HCMV infection on Hes1 protein levels in NPCs. They found that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels through the HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1), which assembles a ubiquitination complex and promotes Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase. This leads to proteasomal degradation of Hes1. The study also identified Sp100A, a component of PML nuclear bodies, as another target of IE1-mediated ubiquitination. The C-terminal acidic region of IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 physical interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination. The findings suggest a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection. This study also identifies IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV-induced neurodevelopmental disorders.
This study investigated the relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression in Drosophila embryos across four species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The researchers used ChIP-seq to measure genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning and mRNA-seq to quantify gene expression. The results showed that mRNA levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding sites, suggesting that a significant amount of transcription factor binding is weak or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. The study found that transcription factor binding has diverged considerably within the Drosophila genus, with relatively few regions bound by any factor in all four species. The researchers identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence, including alterations of specific motifs for the transcription factors BCD, HB, GT, and KR. The study also found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance. Overall, the results suggest that transcription factor binding has undergone extensive divergence in Drosophila embryos, with little effect on downstream gene expression.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centres in Thanjavur district, India, to assess the impact of eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The study found that the prevalence and intensity of microfilariae (Mf) in the surveyed population were 0.2% and 0.004, respectively, while the corresponding values for antigenaemia (Ag) were 2.3% and 17.3 Ag-units. Although the Mf levels in the survey and sentinel/spot check sites were less than 1%, and Ag levels were less than 2% in children, the study identified 7 "residual" and 17 "transmission" hotspots. These hotspots were characterized by Mf prevalence of 1% or more, irrespective of Ag status in children, and at least one Ag-positive child born during the MDA period. The study also found that antigenaemic persons were clustered both at household and site levels. The results suggest that the current monitoring and evaluation guidelines may miss sites with transmission potential and that a threshold value of 1% Ag-prevalence in children may be a more suitable indicator for stopping MDA. The study highlights the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting hotspots and adopting evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for transmission assessment surveys.
A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the community-effectiveness of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, in controlling dengue vectors and disease transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions. The review included 27 studies, of which 11 were single intervention studies and 16 were combined intervention studies. The results showed that temephos was effective in reducing entomological indices when used as a single intervention, but this effect was not sustained over time or was absent when used in combination with other chemical vector control methods. The community-effectiveness of temephos was found to be dependent on various factors, including the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors such as organic debris, temperature, and exposure to sunlight. Additionally, the timing of temephos deployment and its need for reapplication, as well as behavioral and operational factors, were identified as limitations. There was no evidence to suggest that temephos use is associated with reductions in dengue transmission. The review highlights that temephos is one of the most widely used interventions against dengue vectors worldwide, but its effectiveness can vary greatly. The lack of data relating reductions in entomological indices to reductions in dengue transmission remains a significant knowledge gap in the area of dengue epidemiology and vector control efficacy.
The Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, play crucial roles in the establishment of cohesion at the pericentromere in budding yeast. The pericentromere is a region surrounding the centromere where cohesin, a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together, is most abundant. The Ctf19 complex and Csm3 act through distinct mechanisms to mediate pericentromeric cohesion. Components of the Ctf19 complex, including Iml3 and Chl4, direct the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere. In contrast, Csm3 is essential for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. Cells lacking Csm3 show additive cohesion defects in combination with mutants in the Ctf19 complex. Delaying DNA replication rescues the cohesion defect observed in cells lacking Ctf19 complex components, but not Csm3. The Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3. This dedicated pathway of cohesin loading is essential to ensure that cohesin is in place prior to passage of the replication fork early in S phase. The Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are highly conserved, suggesting that a similar mechanism of kinetochore-driven cohesion establishment may operate in other organisms.
A recent study investigated the serum metabolome and lipidome changes in adult patients with primary dengue infection using liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study analyzed serum samples from 44 patients at three stages of infection: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescence. The analysis identified 60 differential metabolites, primarily free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids, which were associated with perturbed metabolic pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathway. The study found that phospholipids and sphingolipids were significantly perturbed during the early stages of infection and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers. The analysis revealed that DENV infection causes temporally distinct serum metabolome and lipidome changes, and many of the differential metabolites are involved in acute inflammatory responses. The study suggests that early anti-inflammatory responses work in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing the host from developing pathologies due to excessive or prolonged inflammation. The findings provide a detailed description of the metabolome changes in patients with acute dengue infection and offer a global molecular view of the underlying mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis. The study's results may be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
This study aimed to map and analyze global Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) research with an affiliation to Germany using co-authorship networks. A SCOPUS database search was conducted for articles with German author affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 on kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. The analysis identified 1, 187 publications with at least one German author affiliation out of 26, 833 worldwide publications addressing 11 diseases. From these, 4, 007 individual authors and 863 research institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent were scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. Strong performers on an individual level were identified using classic parameters and social network analysis. The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators to identify opportunities for collaboration. The findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
The Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population, in collaboration with international partners, has successfully implemented a mass drug administration (MDA) program to control lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000. By 2012, the program had reached full national scale, achieving 100% geographical coverage for LF and consistently exceeding epidemiological targets for both LF and STH. The program's success can be attributed to several key elements, including strong community awareness through a multi-channel communication and education campaign, community trust in voluntary drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment posts, and quality data collection. These strategies have resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF. The program has also established a strong foundation for ongoing STH control. By leveraging sustained international support, Haiti has made steady progress toward LF elimination and is poised to address future challenges, such as maintaining control of STH infections after the LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring morbidity management for patients with lymphatic filarial disease. The program's success highlights the importance of evidence-based implementation strategies, community engagement, and directly observed treatment in achieving high treatment coverage and reducing the burden of NTDs.
In the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, proper regulation of the cell cycle is crucial for coordinating genome replication, segregation, and cell division. During symbiosis with legume hosts, S. meliloti undergoes cellular differentiation, resulting in massive genome amplification, cell branching and/or elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The master regulator CtrA plays a key role in this process, similar to its function in Caulobacter crescentus. However, the regulatory circuit driving cell cycle progression in S. meliloti is not well characterized. This study investigated the regulation and function of CtrA in S. meliloti and found that depletion of CtrA causes cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to that observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism of CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, the study found that S. meliloti CtrA regulates similar processes as C. crescentus CtrA, but through different target genes. For example, S. meliloti CtrA negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system, unlike C. crescentus CtrA, which controls the expression of the Fts complex to regulate cell division. These findings provide insight into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria. The study's model of CtrA cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti will be crucial for understanding how the bacterial cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during symbiosis.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. The bacterium's ability to multiply and survive within macrophages is crucial for its virulence. A study identified a mutant strain of Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) with impaired intracellular multiplication and attenuated virulence in mice. The mutation was found in a gene encoding a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), designated as FTL_0766. The GGT activity of Francisella tularensis allows the bacterium to utilize glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine for intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in the intracellular multiplication of Francisella tularensis. Glutathione is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol, and Francisella tularensis has evolved to utilize it as a source of cysteine in the host cytosol. The study shows that Francisella tularensis uses γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide and GSH as the primary sources of cysteine, and that the GGT activity is required for this process. The mutant strain unable to cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond does not obtain sufficient free cysteine from its surroundings to support growth, and only the addition of free cysteine compensates for its enzymatic deficiency.
The study investigated the fusion of Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PVs) between Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major parasites in infected macrophages. Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes occupy large PVs, while Leishmania major amastigotes reside in small, tight PVs that undergo fission as parasites divide. To determine if PVs of these species can fuse, mouse macrophages were infected with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. Time-lapse image acquisition and colocalization of parasites in the same PVs were used to investigate fusion. The results showed that PVs containing L. amazonensis and L. major amastigotes did not fuse, but PVs containing L. major promastigotes did fuse with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs. In these chimeric vacuoles, L. major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, L. major promastigotes in their own, unfused PVs differentiated into proliferating amastigotes. The study suggests that PVs, customized by L. major amastigotes or promastigotes, differ in their ability to fuse with L. amazonensis PVs, and a species-specific PV is required for L. major destruction or differentiation. The findings have implications for understanding the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species and the mechanisms involved in PV recognition and fusion.
Vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HIV-1 are a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. A recent study investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers to elicit nAbs. The study found that two out of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers and one out of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost, developed unusually potent nAb titers. These nAbs neutralized HIV-1 via quaternary epitopes that exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of the gp120 protein. Specifically, the nAbs targeted the absence of a glycan at residue 197, which is present in 98.7% of HIV-1 Envs, and the absence of a glycan at residue 230, both of which are proximal to the CD4 binding site. The nAbs also targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a putative "glycan fence" that limits access to this region. The study suggests that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes, and that cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. These findings provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
This study investigated the use of immunohistochemical markers to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcers (BU) treated with a combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin. Tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions were collected before, during, and after chemotherapy and analyzed for the presence of markers associated with connective tissue neo-formation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation. The results showed that several target proteins were suitable for monitoring wound healing, including α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) positive myofibroblasts, which emerged during the healing process and produced extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin. These cells were found in fibronectin-rich areas and showed ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation initiation. Additionally, healing wounds revealed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 (CK16) expression in the epidermis. The study identified a set of markers that allow monitoring wound healing in antibiotic-treated BU lesions by immunohistochemistry, including αSMA, fibronectin, pro-collagen 1, tenascin-C, and CK16. These markers may help to better understand the disturbances responsible for wound healing delays observed in some BU patients. Furthermore, the study suggests that the mTor pathway might play an important role during wound healing in BU, and its activation may help to discriminate between healing and non-healing wounds.
The study investigated the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial trafficking in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo. Using confocal imaging of saphenous nerves in anaesthetized mice, the researchers found that low-frequency electrical stimulation significantly increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in comparison to silent axons. Higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) further increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Topical application of capsaicin to the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve also increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population did not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continued to travel anterogradely. The study suggests that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of particularly high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction. The increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may represent a mechanism that ensures a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load, supporting the increased metabolic demand imposed by sustained conduction. The findings demonstrate a physiological relationship between impulse activity and mitochondrial trafficking along normal, adult, myelinated, and unmyelinated mammalian peripheral axons in vivo.
The loss of Filamin B (FLNB) function has been linked to spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions. A study using Flnb knockout mice found that the intervertebral discs (IVDs) undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal development due to abnormal cell fate changes in the annulus fibrosus (AF). The AF cells in Flnb–/– mice lose their fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes, leading to endochondral-like ossification, including alterations in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of the disc tissue. The conversion of AF cells into chondrocytes is coincident with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP-induced p38 signaling, as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes p21 and Ctgf. These findings indicate that FLNB is involved in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influencing AF cell fate. The study demonstrates that the IVD disruptions in Flnb–/– mice resemble aging degenerative discs, providing new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration. The results suggest that the loss of FLNB leads to increased TGFβ and BMP signaling, initiating a cascade of cell fate changes, including differentiation, IVD degeneration, and bony fusions.
The study identifies a novel mechanism by which the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV) targets the host cell's antiviral response. THOV's Matrix protein long (ML) engages with the general transcription factor TFIIB, leading to its re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This results in a TFIIB-depleted nuclear environment, which impairs the de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoter start sites. Consequently, the expression of genes that require de novo recruitment of Pol II, including many inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules, is affected. In contrast, genes that are already loaded with Pol II on their promoters can still be transcribed. The study suggests that THOV's targeting of TFIIB represents a mechanism to modulate the innate immune response while minimizing disruption to other cellular transcriptional processes. This mechanism allows THOV to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines required for an antiviral response while promoting the expression of negative regulators and tissue repair factors. The study proposes that targeting TFIIB activity may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. The findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions between viruses and the host cell's antiviral response.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) leads to cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2-phase, characterized by 4N DNA content. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral DNA replication but is dispensable for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. A putative C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD2) within the NS1 protein is responsible for G2-phase arrest. The NS1 TAD2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest by transactivating cellular gene expression, which activates the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) pathway. Activated ATR phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216, inactivating the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and ATR activation plays an important role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest. The DDR is essential for viral DNA replication but has no effect on cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. Expression of B19V NS1 alone induces "true" G2-phase arrest, characterized by 4N DNA content without BrdU uptake. The NS1 TAD2 domain is responsible for G2-phase arrest, and its dysregulation of the cell cycle is mediated by the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway.
Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce endothelial hyperpermeability in a systemic mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells by disrupting the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer. This study investigated the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways to DENV NS1-induced vascular leak. In vivo, DENV NS1 triggered localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of wild-type C57BL/6 mice, whereas West Nile virus NS1 did not. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8), and blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Furthermore, DENV NS1-induced vascular leak was observed in TLR4- or TNF-α receptor-deficient mice at similar levels to wild-type animals. Inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption blocked DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in vivo. These findings indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components. The results suggest potential targets for novel therapeutics that inhibit enzymes contributing to degradation of glycocalyx components for the treatment of severe dengue disease. The study contributes to the growing body of literature demonstrating a critical role for NS1 in dengue pathogenesis, specifically in its contributions to directly pathogenic effects on the vascular endothelium.
In budding yeast, the integrity of the septin ring at the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The SPOC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis if the anaphase spindle does not properly align with the division axis. The Kin4 protein kinase and the Kin4-regulating Elm1 kinase are essential for SPOC signaling. This study reveals that the redundant ubiquitin-ligases Dma1 and Dma2 control septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck. Dma1 and Dma2 mutants show reduced levels of Elm1 at the bud neck and Elm1-dependent activation of Kin4. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck of Dma1 Dma2 mutant cells is sufficient to re-establish a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response. The data indicate that septin dynamics and SPOC function are intimately linked and support the idea that integrity of the bud neck is crucial for SPOC signaling. Dma1 and Dma2 share a central FHA domain and a C-terminal RING finger domain, typical of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and contribute to the stabilization of the septin ring throughout the cell cycle. The study proposes a model for SPOC signaling where Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck.
Title: Adaptations to Climate-Mediated Selective Pressures in Humans

    A genome-wide scan for evidence of positive selection in response to climatic variation has been conducted using allele frequency data from 61 worldwide populations. The analysis identified a significant enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to non-genic SNPs that are strongly correlated with climate variables. This suggests that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of genetic variation in humans. The strongest signals of selection were found in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. Several of these signals overlap with those from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. The results imply that climate has exerted selective pressures on human populations, leading to adaptations in genes and variants involved in immune response, autoimmune disease, and cancer. A subset of SNPs with extremely large Bayes factors (BF) for climate variables were also strongly associated with traits based on GWAS results. These SNPs are implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune disease. The study found a significant enrichment of genic SNPs with strong correlations with climate relative to non-genic SNPs in all population subsets, including those with smaller numbers of populations. The findings suggest that climate has played a central role in shaping human genetic variation.
The study investigated the arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr)-linked SQT1 variant of the short QT syndrome (SQTS), a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. Markov chain models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley models in reproducing experimental data regarding the effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. Ionic channel models were incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealized and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and a 3D anatomical model. The N588K mutation was found to abbreviate ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and decrease the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs, resulting in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD90 and the effective refractory period (ERP). However, when considering transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in the intact tissue model, the N588K mutation led to QT-shortening, increased T-wave amplitude, and augmented δV in some local regions of ventricle tissue, increasing tissue vulnerability to uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. The study provides a comprehensive explanation for increased susceptibility to re-entry and perpetuation of re-entrant arrhythmia in SQT1.
The article presents a novel approach to understanding collective motion in zebrafish (Danio rerio) using deep attention networks. The authors propose a model that is both predictive and insightful, capable of recovering the ground-truth interaction rules used to generate simulated trajectories. The model consists of two subnetworks: a pair-interaction subnetwork and an aggregation subnetwork. The pair-interaction subnetwork describes the interaction between a focal fish and its n closest neighbors, while the aggregation subnetwork aggregates the outputs of the pair-interaction subnetworks to produce a single vector. The authors use a deep attention network to extract attraction, repulsion, and alignment as approximate notions from the trained pairwise interaction function. When applied to experimental trajectories of large groups of zebrafish, the model reveals that interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive, attractive, or as alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The model also shows that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbors, with weights higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The network extracts that the number of interacting individuals is dynamic and typically in the range of 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones. The results suggest that each animal decides by dynamically selecting information from the collective.
A phylodynamic approach was employed to quantify the fitness costs of major HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The study utilized stochastic birth–death–sampling processes to model the transmission tree of viral lineages, allowing for the quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-sensitive strains. The study focused on eight resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes, including 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S, 219Q, 90M, 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, and 190A. The results showed that the 90M mutation in the protease gene had a significantly higher fitness than the drug-sensitive strains, while the mutations 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were less fit than the sensitive strains. The remaining resistance mutations did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These findings are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. The study developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations, which may be useful in assessing the risk of transmitted drug resistance in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data are missing.
The Elongator complex, which includes the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, plays a crucial role in the modification of certain tRNAs, specifically the uridine wobble nucleoside of tRNAs for lysine, glutamine, and glutamic acid. This modification, known as mcm5s2U34, is essential for the efficient translation of highly expressed mRNAs, particularly those involved in the stress transcriptional program governed by the Sty1-Atf1-Pcr1 pathway. In fission yeast, cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 are sensitive to oxidative stress due to their inability to modify tRNALysUUU, leading to inefficient translation of stress-induced mRNAs. The main H2O2-dependent genes, including those coding for the transcription factors Atf1 and Pcr1, are highly expressed mRNAs containing a biased number of lysine-coding codons AAA versus AAG, which are poorly translated in cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 or Ctu2. However, over-expression of tRNALysUUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells, indicating that the lack of tRNA modification is the primary cause of stress sensitivity. Furthermore, strains lacking Ctu1 or Ctu2, which are involved in other tRNA modifying activities, exhibit similar phenotypes to Elongator mutants, suggesting that tRNA modification is essential for stress tolerance. These findings suggest that the transcriptional defects observed in Elongator mutants are a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of a transcription factor, Atf1-Pcr1, and other components of the transcriptional machinery.
The article describes a novel function of the Nef protein in HIV-1, where it confers resistance to neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the TMgp41 protein. Nef increases the infectivity of HIV-1 virions and accelerates progression to AIDS. The study found that Nef renders HIV-1 virions refractory to the broadly-neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10, which target the MPER of TMgp41. This effect is specific, as Nef had no impact on sensitivity to nine other Env-neutralizing agents. The resistance to 2F5 and 4E10 was observed with Nef from various HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. Functional analysis of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires Nef myristoylation but is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. The study suggests that Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, which is consistent with the membrane-dependence of MPER-recognition by 2F5 and 4E10. These findings have important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
The study investigated the molecular interactions between the snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, and the carcinogenic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. Using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, the researchers characterized the transcriptomes of uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos. The results revealed 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Notably, genes encoding proteases were down-regulated in infected snails, while genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins were up-regulated. These findings suggest that O. viverrini may suppress the snail's immune response, allowing the parasite to successfully colonize its intermediate host. The study provides a foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products involved in the snail-parasite interaction. The annotated dataset represents a valuable resource for investigating susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini and for comparative analyses with other snail intermediate hosts of platyhelminths, including schistosomes. The results have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of CCA and for the discovery of potential targets for intervention.
A case-control study investigated the association between complement receptor 1 (CR1) polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels in Brazilian leprosy patients. The study found that individuals with a specific recombinant haplotype, harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26, had twice the susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). This haplotype was also associated with lower sCR1 levels in paucibacillary patients, which may reduce the anti-inflammatory response (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). Furthermore, the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and was associated with higher gene expression, possibly increasing internalization of the parasite. An inverse correlation was found between sCR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin levels (R = -0.52, p = 0.007). The study suggests a regulatory role for CR1 polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy, possibly by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. This study is the first to specifically analyze the influence of CR1 haplotypes, mRNA expression, and sCR1 levels in leprosy susceptibility.
This study investigated sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determination in a large population-based cohort. Metabolomic profiling and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) were used to comprehensively explore gene regulatory networks and investigate the effects of genetic variation at the molecular level. A total of 3, 300 individuals from the KORA F3 and F4 studies were analyzed for 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. The results showed significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites ( p-values<3. 8×10−4; Bonferroni-corrected threshold ). Sex-specific GWAS revealed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus ( carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 ) for glycine. The study found that the metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different and that specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. A combined meta-analysis of KORA F4 and KORA F3 revealed 113 metabolites with a significant effect of sex ( Bonferroni-corrected meta-analysis significance level: p<3. 8×10−4 ). The study provides new insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in the design and interpretation of studies. The findings shed light on biochemical mechanisms that might explain observed differences in susceptibility and time course of the development of common diseases in males and females.
Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, and optimization-based approaches are often necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function used in these optimization algorithms is directly linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling. A widely used method for formulating metabolic objective functions is the linear combination of selected fluxes, but this approach is sensitive to stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. This sensitivity leads to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations, making biological interpretation subjective and ambiguous. To address this issue, a new method called Minimization of Metabolites Balance ( MiMBl ) is proposed. MiMBl decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, it is demonstrated that stoichiometry representation-independent algorithms are fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. MiMBl allows for the expansion of the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The study investigated the relationship between plague distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. The researchers conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas with different topographic relief profiles within the Madagascan plague focus. The results showed that rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief, as expected. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not solely related to the effective dispersal of rats. Genetic diversity estimates indicated that plague epizootics had a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir, suggesting that human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations. The study found significant but weak genotypic differentiation of R. rattus subpopulations over a relatively small spatial scale. The results suggest that plague spread in rat and human populations can be partly related to the population genetic structure of the reservoir, but also to human social activities.
The study investigated the human IgG1 responses to surface-localized Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family members, specifically SmLy6A and SmLy6B, in a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after praziquantel treatment. A comprehensive reanalysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family revealed 11 members, including three novel proteins. The presence of canonical cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI-anchor sites suggests that all SmLy6 proteins are cell surface-bound. The study found that pre-treatment IgG1 prevalence for SmLy6A and SmLy6B was 7.4% and 25.3% of the cohort, respectively, which is higher than the IgG1 prevalence for a sub-surface tegumental antigen, SmTAL1. After praziquantel treatment, IgG1 levels against surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly dropped compared to rising IgG1 levels against sub-surface SmTAL1. These results demonstrate that surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities. The study expands the number of SmLy6 proteins found within S. mansoni and provides evidence that these proteins are immunogenic in human populations. The findings suggest that SmLy6A and SmLy6B may be potential vaccine candidates for schistosomiasis.
The study presents a computer simulation of epithelial tissue in the Drosophila retina to investigate the role of N-cadherin in cell morphology during tissue morphogenesis. The simulation minimizes the global interfacial energy between cells and reproduces the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells. The model incorporates features of morphogenesis, including the timing of N-cadherin expression and its temporal relationship to cell-cell contact remodeling. The simulations distinguish between different mechanisms of how cadherin levels are attained and controlled, and indicate that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, modulating adhesion strengths between cells. The study demonstrates that the model describes characteristic shape changes in mutants and incorporates dynamical features of morphogenesis, such as the temporal sequence of cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling. The model features include the recycling and redistribution of unpaired N-cadherin molecules, the temporal dynamics of N-cadherin gene expression, and the temporal dynamics of cell-cell contacts. These features are established without additional free parameters. The study applies these considerations to a mechanical model and tests the fit of various distribution and dynamic models with experimental data for mutants in which certain cells produce altered levels of N-cadherin. The results emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling.
The study aimed to investigate the role of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, the researchers found that MT1-MMP is rapidly turned over at invadopodia, with a turnover rate approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds. The recovery of MT1-MMP at invadopodia was primarily dependent on vesicle transport, rather than lateral diffusion. A computational model was constructed to simulate the observed kinetics of the FRAP experiments, which successfully reproduced the experimental results. The model suggested that the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP is essential for ECM degradation at invadopodia. Inhibition of vesicle transport both experimentally and in simulation blocked ECM degradation, and the degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT1-MMP turnover. The study also found that proteolytic activity and MT1-MMP turnover contribute synergistically to ECM degradation, with a nonlinear and marked reduction in ECM degradation when both factors were reduced simultaneously. The computational model provides a new tool for designing and evaluating intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) evolution in four macaques infected with RT-SHIVmne027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The macaques were treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and viral DNA and RNA were isolated from the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points. Single-genome sequencing revealed a dynamic system in which viral RNA rapidly acquired drug resistance mutations concomitantly across compartments through multiple independent mutations. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized rarely, while the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. The gut had faster vRNA turnover than the plasma, and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses than other sampled compartments. These findings suggest that even frequently sampled blood does not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, particularly the gut. The study's results may help explain the varied results of previous compartmentalization studies in HIV-1. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the genetic variation of HIV-1 across the body when reconstructing transmission chains and epidemiological tracking of transmitted drug resistance. Furthermore, understanding HIV-1 genetic variation across the body may contribute to our understanding of viral reservoirs and the potential for virus eradication.
Feedback regulation of cell lineage progression plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue size homeostasis, but its role in tissue morphogenesis is not well understood. A mathematical model was used to investigate the effects of feedback regulation on tissue morphogenesis. The model showed that a feedback architecture involving both positive and negative diffusible signals acting on stem and/or progenitor cells can lead to bistable or bi-modal growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and the triggering of self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise from the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal, rather than the regulation of cell cycle speeds. The spatial patterns that emerge in this setting are the result of interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not the consequence of Turing-type instabilities. The model also showed that the simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback is a necessary condition for growth bistability or bimodality to occur. The results suggest that feedback regulation of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to the spontaneous emergence of spatially dynamic behaviors, manifesting as sharply localized differences in net growth. The conditions required for underlying phenomena such as bistability, ultrasensitivity, and spatial self-organization to arise in such systems were mathematically defined, and were shown to drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers, which are the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis.
The largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness, has identified 22 significant genetic associations with the age of onset of myopia in Europeans. The study, which analyzed data from 45,771 participants, found that these associations explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset. Ten of the 20 novel associations identified in the study replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who reported developing myopia before age 10. The findings suggest that multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of myopia and point to complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina. Associations were found in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (LAMA2), the visual cycle (RGR and RDH5), neuronal development (ZIC2 and SFRP1), and neuronal signaling (five genes). One association was also found in the gene PRSS56, which has previously been linked to abnormally small eyes. The study's results indicate that genetic factors may affect the age of onset of myopia independently of its severity, and that the strength of genetic associations with myopia may depend on the specific phenotype under study. The findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying myopia and highlight the complexity of the disorder.
This study investigates the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model. The lamprey has a central pattern generator ( CPG ) circuit that activates muscles for locomotion and adjusts activity in response to sensory inputs from the environment. The CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, where pairs of phase oscillators represent the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. These oscillators activate muscles that flex the body and move the lamprey through a fluid environment simulated using a full Navier-Stokes model. The emergent curvature of the body serves as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback are considered : directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on the sign of a gain parameter, and magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. The results show that directional feedback does not affect beat frequency but changes the duration of muscle activity, while magnitude feedback tends to increase beat frequency and reduce the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. Both types of feedback result in a similar magnitude of body curvature, indicating that different functional forms of curvature-based feedback can cause distinct differences in swimming performance.
HIV Competition Dynamics over Sexual Networks: First Comer Advantage Conserves Founder Effects
    The global phylogeography of HIV outside Africa is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects. A stochastic modelling framework was developed to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. Simulations showed that the spread of a second strain into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic occurred on a much slower time scale compared to the initial expansion of the first strain. With strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed a considerable ( >25% ) advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. Simulations also confirmed a strong first comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and influence the future evolution of the pandemic. The study suggests that the first strain to colonize a population has a significant advantage over subsequent strains, which may slow down the diversification of the epidemic.
The self-organization of muscle cell structure and function is a complex process that spans multiple length scales, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. To investigate this process, researchers developed a quantitative model of how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes in response to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. The model revealed that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered organizational processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as the cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. The results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton and that a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry, which is potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions. The model also recapitulates the elegant protein choreography of sarcomere assembly, where an ensemble of proteins assembles repetitively along the length of the actin fiber template. The study highlights the importance of extracellular spatial cues in organizing myofibrils and contraction in muscle cells, and suggests that a hierarchy of mechanisms may be responsible for myofibrillar organization. The findings have implications for understanding the development and function of striated muscle cells.
The symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is being trialled as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The wMel strain of Wolbachia has been shown to cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility in laboratory experiments with Brazilian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To understand the effects of different urban landscapes on the invasive potential of Wolbachia, mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. Mathematical models were constructed using both laboratory and field data to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. The results suggest that the wMel strain of Wolbachia will likely be able to successfully invade five distinct field sites around the city of Rio de Janeiro, with local mosquito abundance being the most important factor influencing the spread of Wolbachia. The study provides a useful framework for the ongoing field-releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti in Brazil, and will likely hold similar utility for future releases in other similarly heterogeneous urban landscapes. The findings highlight the importance of characterizing field sites prior to the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to determine the optimal release strategy.
The study identified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of the JMJ703 gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. The crystal structure of the catalytic core domain (c-JMJ703) of the protein revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703, including key residues that interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxalylglycine and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide, which are essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. These residues are conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation. JMJ703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation and specifically demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 in vivo and in vitro, implying that it is important for rice gene expression. The study suggests that JMJ703 may regulate growth hormone metabolism in rice, which is different from JMJ14 that has functions in floral transition, DNA methylation, and RNA silencing in Arabidopsis.
The HIV-1 capsid plays a crucial role in the infectious cycle of the virus, from reverse transcription to integration site selection, and is targeted by multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands. However, previous structural studies have been limited to monomeric capsid subunits (CA), hindering the understanding of how these ligands influence infection. This study reveals that a multi-subunit interface formed within CA hexamers mediates binding to linear epitopes within cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, as well as the antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand binds to a shared phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif in a pocket within the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with additional interactions across the N-terminal domain:C-terminal domain (NTD:CTD) interface to a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into CA monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with CPSF6 and PF74, and abolishes binding to NUP153. The NTD:CTD interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding of NUP153 or CPSF6 peptides is accommodated by only one conformation. NUP153 and CPSF6 have overlapping binding sites, but each makes unique CA interactions that, when mutated selectively, perturb cofactor dependency. These results demonstrate that multiple ligands share an overlapping interface in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effect of ligand binding on intact capsid, particularly in the context of conflicting reports on the effect of PF74 and BI-2 on capsid stability.
The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a primary vector of several human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. However, its genome has been poorly assembled due to the presence of many repetitive sequences, resulting in 4,758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to a chromosome. To improve the genome assembly and facilitate the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission, researchers scored a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti and generated a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. After correcting these errors, the researchers were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. Notably, large regions of suppressed recombination were found around the centromeres, which can extend to as much as 47% of the chromosome. To demonstrate the utility of the new genome assembly, the researchers mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi and identified candidate genes that could be affecting the trait. This improved genome assembly will facilitate the identification of genetic components of vector competence and the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission in Ae. aegypti.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a key target of vector control programs in tropical countries. A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities with varying tropical climate regimens to compare the effectiveness of four types of traps ( BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps ) with traditional household larval surveys. The study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of these surveillance tools in detecting mosquito density variations. Traps were applied monthly to three 1 km2 areas per city, while larval surveys were performed simultaneously. The results showed that the House Index was consistently low in most cities, with a median of 0. In contrast, traps rarely produced null indices, indicating their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypti compared to larval surveys. Trap positivity indices tended to plateau at high mosquito densities, but both indices agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variations. The study concluded that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should consider differences in cost and ease-of-use. The results support the development of trap-based surveillance programs in dengue-endemic countries and suggest that traps can be used in combination with vector control strategies to improve responses to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti.
The human protein APOBEC3G (A3G) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses, including HIV-1, through its ability to deaminate cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. A3G contains two canonical cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal one known to mediate cytidine deamination. Using the crystal structure of the related tetrameric APOBEC2 (A2) protein, researchers identified residues within A3G that facilitate oligomerization of the protein. Specifically, tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 within the N-terminal CDA domain were found to mediate A3G oligomerization, which coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, oligomerization was shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology modeling of A3G onto the A2 template structure revealed an accumulation of positive charge in a pocket formed by a putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. These findings suggest that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging into virions, and antiviral function. The study provides new insights into the structure-function organization of APOBEC proteins and highlights the importance of RNA-dependent oligomerization in A3G's antiviral activity.
Biologists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of complex traits that vary quantitatively in populations. However, identifying the genes and sequence variants responsible for this variation has been challenging due to biological and technical complexities. Drosophila melanogaster, with its high levels of sequence variation and low linkage disequilibrium, provides an ideal model system to dissect the effects of multiple causative variants within a single locus. This study focuses on the bric-a-brac (bab) locus, which is involved in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries. The researchers sequenced the 148 kb bab genomic region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster and found that natural alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation result from a cumulative impact of polymorphisms affecting three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the bab locus confirmed that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. This study demonstrates that a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) can act through multiple molecular mechanisms and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. These findings have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and have potential applications in basic and medical genomics.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains a persistent cause of disease in humans despite antibiotic and vaccine use due to its ability to adapt through genetic exchange with the surrounding microbial community. This adaptation is facilitated by a tightly regulated quorum sensing system that controls DNA uptake and recombination. The competence stimulating peptide (CSP) triggers this system, leading to the production of a diverse array of bacteriocins, including Blp bacteriocins. CSP stimulates Blp bacteriocin production by increasing the production and secretion of the BlpC pheromone, which requires a functional competence regulatory system. A conserved motif in the promoter of the BlpC operon mediates this upregulation. The accumulation of BlpC results in the activation of the entire Blp locus. In biofilm-grown organisms, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion, suggesting that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The blp and com regulatory pathways, which have diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor of pneumococcus, have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation by targeting potential competitors for lysis while providing a means for DNA incorporation. This connection allows pneumococcus to target a wide array of competitors while incorporating their DNA, contributing to its remarkable adaptability.
During poliovirus infection, the cellular protein SRp20 undergoes a dramatic re-localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it partially co-localizes with the protein PCBP2. This interaction between SRp20 and PCBP2 is crucial for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation initiation. In poliovirus-infected cells, SRp20 and PCBP2 co-sediment with 40S ribosomal subunits, suggesting their involvement in translation initiation complex formation. The interaction between SRp20 and PCBP2 on the viral RNA is thought to function either directly or indirectly to recruit the translation machinery to the viral RNA for IRES-mediated translation initiation. A mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif ( SRp20ΔRRM ) is still localized to the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection, but its expression results in a significant decrease in virus yield for poliovirus. This suggests that SRp20 plays a critical role in poliovirus infection and that its interaction with PCBP2 on the viral RNA is essential for efficient translation initiation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ribosome recruitment for picornavirus IRES-mediated translation initiation and highlight the importance of non-canonical factors in bridging the translation machinery to the viral RNA. Overall, these results support a model in which SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 bound to the viral RNA to facilitate the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation initiation.
The neural crest (NC) is a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including glia and neurons of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems, and melanocytes of the skin and hair. To identify molecular pathways regulating NC development and understand how alterations in these processes lead to disease, an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen was conducted using a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10LacZ/+. The screen identified four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1–4 (msp1–4), which show altered NC patterning. One of these loci, msp1, was found to be a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, Erbb3msp1, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. The mutation does not alter protein expression but impairs ERBB3 signaling, resulting in embryonic defects similar to those of Erbb3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis revealed that the mutant protein is expressed on the cell surface but exhibits reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation. These findings highlight the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation. The study demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC development and dissecting the roles of discrete protein domains, contributing to a better understanding of gene function in a cellular and developmental setting.
This study investigated the factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community receiving treatment as part of a multi-disciplinary longitudinal reinfection study. The researchers examined the influence of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment, using individual estimates of cercarial exposure and multivariable methods to account for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. The study found that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility to infection. In contrast, age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure and appeared linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1, which was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. The study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and make more robust conclusions. The findings suggest that cercarial exposure is a key factor in determining susceptibility to S. mansoni infection, and that IgE and IgG4 immune responses may play a role in resistance to reinfection. The study's results have implications for the development of effective control strategies for schistosomiasis in endemic communities.
The present study investigated the correlation between fecal egg counts (EPGs) and worm burden in human clonorchiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Clonorchis sinensis. A total of 60 residents from Sancheong-gun, Korea, participated in the study, 50 of whom were egg-positive and 10 egg-negative. After administration of praziquantel, the participants were purged with cathartics, and adult worms were collected from their feces. The results showed a positive correlation between EPGs and the number of worms (r = 0.681, P < 0.001). The worm recovery rates were 9.7% in cases with EPGs 1-1,000 and 73.7% in those with EPGs over 1,000. No worms were detected from egg-negative subjects. The maximum egg count per worm per day was estimated to be approximately 3,770 in a subject with EPGs 2,664 and 106 collected worms. The study estimated that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with EPGs around 3,000, and the egg productivity of a worm per day is approximately 4,000. The results suggest that the number of eggs per gram of feces is a reliable indicator of worm burden in human clonorchiasis. The study also confirmed that praziquantel medication and purgation is a safe and reliable method for collecting adult worms from infected human subjects.
The emergence of anti-fungal drug resistance poses a significant challenge in the treatment of fungal infections. To combat this issue, researchers have explored novel therapeutic approaches, including combinatorial therapy and unbiased genome-wide screens. A recent study implemented an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele, which is the primary mediator of fluconazole resistance in this human fungal pathogen. The screen identified 18 synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants, one of which was the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5. Further investigation revealed that deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of Gcn5 inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. The study demonstrated that targeting Gcn5, a synthetically lethal interacting partner of PDR1L280F, renders both S. cerevisiae and the orthologous C. glabrata mutant inviable. These findings support the proposition that targeting synthetic lethal interactions offers a new paradigm for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. The study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that, when therapeutically targeted, could allow effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.
During poliovirus (PV) infection, the formation of membranous structures containing phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) has been observed. These structures appear as vesicular clusters in cross-section and are induced and remodeled prior to or concurrent with genome replication. To investigate the pathway of formation of PV-induced membranous structures, two PV mutants, EG and GG, were used. These mutants exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, delaying the onset of genome replication and/or impairing virus assembly. In wild-type PV, changes to the PI4P pool were observed as early as 30 minutes post-infection. PI4P remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, and was accompanied by the formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection, a time too slow for these structures to be responsible for genome replication. The delays in the onset of genome replication observed for EG and GG PVs were similar to the delays in virus-induced remodeling of PI4P pools, consistent with PI4P serving as a marker of the genome-replication organelle. The results suggest that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters). The pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.
A multi-step cascade strategy combining ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods was employed to identify non-peptidic cruzain inhibitors from the ZINC database. This approach resulted in the selection of 23 compounds, 12 of which exhibited non-covalent binding to cruzain with affinity values in the low micromolar range ( 3–60 µM ). X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed the competitive inhibition mechanism of one of the inhibitors, Nequimed176. Cruzain is a validated therapeutic target for Chagas disease, a neglected trypanosomiasis with significant social and economic impact in Latin America. Since cruzain shares high similarity with the mammalian homolog cathepsin L, which is associated with invasive properties and metastatic cancer cells, the cruzain inhibitors were also assayed against cathepsin L. The results showed poor selectivity towards cruzain but raised the possibility of investigating these inhibitors for their effect on cell proliferation. Two of the most potent cruzain inhibitors were found to have trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi-infected cells, with one compound, Nequimed42, exhibiting an IC50 value of 10. 6±0. 1 µM against the trypomastigote form of the Tulahuen lacZ strain, tenfold lower than the positive control benznidazole. A smaller compound derived from Nequimed42, Nequimed176, was identified as a novel non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor with a ligand efficiency of 0. 33 kcal mol−1 atom−1 and potential as a trypanocidal agent for optimization.
The article presents the development and evaluation of two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations as potential vaccines against yellow fever (YF) virus. These formulations encode the full-length envelope protein (p/YFE) or the full-length envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal, LAMP-1 (pL/YFE). The immune responses triggered by these formulations were evaluated in H2b and H2d backgrounds, corresponding to the C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice strains, respectively. The results show that both DNA constructs were able to induce strong T-cell responses against almost all epitopes generated by the YF 17DD vaccine, with the pL/YFE formulation performing best overall. Additionally, the pL/YFE formulation stimulated high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the 17DD vaccine. Importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine conferred 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. These results indicate that pL/YFE DNA is an excellent vaccine candidate and should be considered for further developmental studies. The study also expanded the epitope mapping for the envelope protein of the YF virus in C57Bl/6 mice, identifying 11 antigenic 15-mer peptides from the YF envelope protein. Overall, the findings suggest that the pL/YFE DNA vaccine has the potential to provide effective protection against YF virus infection.
The nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA has been identified as a direct transcriptional activator of the chitobiose utilization genes in Vibrio cholerae. Chitobiose utilization is essential for the persistence and evolution of V. cholerae in the marine environment. The chb operon, which encodes genes involved in chitobiose uptake and catabolism, is regulated by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. However, the mechanisms downstream of ChiS activation that result in expression of the chb operon were poorly understood. An unbiased transposon mutant screen revealed that SlmA is a regulator of the chb operon. SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are generally transcriptional repressors. In vitro experiments showed that SlmA binds directly to the chb operon promoter, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this interaction is required for transcriptional activation of this locus and for chitobiose utilization. Point mutations that disrupt distinct functions of SlmA revealed that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcriptional activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae, in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor. The findings suggest that SlmA is a direct activator of the chb operon and is required for growth of V. cholerae on chitobiose.
The article presents a nonlinear programming framework for solving parameter estimation problems in dynamic biological system models. These problems are computationally challenging due to highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, many experimental data sets, and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. It employs a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and utilizes computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. The authors demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. They show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1, 704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using the proposed framework, while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours. The framework is also shown to be scalable and can solve problems with up to 2, 352 parameters, 2, 304 differential equations, and 20, 352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, enabling the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, perform model selection, and handle outliers.
This study utilized the nCounter digital gene expression system to investigate the inflammatory response in the West Nile virus (WNV) Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model over a nine-day course of infection. The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression kit, containing 179 inflammation-related genes, was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues, including spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain, following intraperitoneal injection with WNV. Protein expression levels for a subset of cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using a multiplex protein detection system (BioPlex). The results showed that Cxcl10 and Il12b were differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney. Data stratification of infected versus non-infected tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from WNV infection. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in WNV-infected tissues, including upregulation of Stat1, Tlr2, chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, cytokines Il6, Il18, cytokine-related gene Il1r, and cytokine agonist Ilrn in WNV-infected livers. Similar gene and protein expression kinetics were found for Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5 and correlated with the presence of infectious virus. The study demonstrated the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes in SW mice associated with WNV infection. The results provide insights into the dynamic gene expression profiles of the inflammatory response in WNV-infected SW mice and highlight the potential of the nCounter system for studying viral pathogenesis.
In 2014, an outbreak of human rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites. Between April and August 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were detected, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite, with only one of the 14 rabid dogs having been immunized. A total of 819 cases of animal bites were registered, with dogs responsible for 97.8% of all bites, but only 27.0% were immunized. The study found that factors significantly associated with human rabies were age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. The investigation also revealed that implementation of control measures for rabies is poor in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures. The study highlights the need for improved rabies control measures, including vaccination of dogs and post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals bitten by animals. The findings of this study contribute to formulating recommendations and strategies to control rabies in Mozambique, a country with one of the highest burdens of rabies in sub-Saharan Africa.
The SCN9A gene, which encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel alpha subunit, has been identified as a potential cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large Utah family. A mutation, p.N641Y, in a highly conserved amino acid in the SCN9A gene was found in 21 affected family members, but not in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To investigate the functional role of this mutation, the orthologous mutation was introduced into the murine Scn9a gene using targeted homologous recombination. Homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation is disease-causing in this family. Further analysis of 92 unrelated FS patients identified additional highly conserved Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. One patient with FS later developed Dravet syndrome, a severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and sequencing of the SCN1A gene revealed a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Nav1.7 missense variants, all in highly conserved amino acids. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations. The SCN9A-N641Y mutation is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of seizure phenotypes, including simple FS, self-limited afebrile seizures, and temporal lobe epilepsy.
Biologists have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, a process that often involves preferential growth along particular orientations. Two theories have been proposed to explain how these orientations are specified: the axiality-based system, which suggests that orientations are determined by stresses in the tissue, and the polarity-based system, which proposes that orientations can be specified independently of stresses through molecular signalling. This study develops and applies a polarity-based system, called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, which treats tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors under genetic control interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organisers, also under genetic control. The GPT framework allows for the specification of growth rates parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity through a regulatory network, resulting in growth that depends on the interaction of specified growth patterns within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue. This leads to the emergence of features such as curvature that were not directly specified by the regulatory networks. The study illustrates the value of the GPT framework for understanding morphogenesis by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower and proposes that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes.
During early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus's genome. This leads to the emergence of mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies have observed that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they fixate in the population, a phenomenon known as the pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD). This pattern can arise through distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains in large populations with high beneficial mutation rates. In this study, the authors investigated how interference between concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes and whether it could be a source of the ERD pattern. Using a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination, the authors found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. They also found that the number of loci and recombination rates significantly affect ERD, which can be explained by the underexponential decline of escape rates over time. The results suggest that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations and that novel estimation methodologies are needed to account for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations. The study also found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects.
A mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment has been developed to estimate the in vivo antitumor efficacy of cisplatin-based doublet therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The model takes into account various cancer-related mechanisms, including uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The model is based on the provision of tumor volumetric data at two time points, before and after or during treatment, and considers the effect of the tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify key features for accurate estimates, which were found to be the volume growth rate and the growth fraction at diagnosis. The model was applied to retrospective data from 13 patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The selection of model input values was guided by a comprehensive literature survey on cancer-specific proliferation kinetics, and Latin hypercube sampling was used to compensate for patient-specific uncertainties. The results provide a quantitative framework for estimating the in vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies, which could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions. The study demonstrates the potential of in silico experimentation to suggest optimal treatment protocols for individual patients based on their own multiscale data.
This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying high biofilm-specific tolerance to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin in Escherichia coli. The researchers used random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific tolerant mutants and found that starved biofilms exhibited significantly greater tolerance to ofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. The study demonstrated that the biofilm-associated tolerance to ofloxacin was fully dependent on a functional SOS response upon starvation to both amino acids and carbon source, and partially dependent on the stringent response upon leucine starvation. However, the biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin–antitoxin systems previously associated with the formation of highly tolerant persisters. The researchers further showed that ofloxacin tolerance was induced as a function of biofilm age, which was dependent on the SOS response. Biofilm heterogeneity creates specialized niches in which bacteria respond to local cues, leading to genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations exhibiting high tolerance to extracellular stresses such as antibiotics. The study suggests that the SOS stress response induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm-specific antibiotic tolerance and highlight the importance of the SOS response in mediating this tolerance.
Plasmodium falciparum merozoites invade human erythrocytes through specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. A key regulator of this process is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which triggers the timely secretion of microneme proteins enabling receptor-engagement and invasion. Exposure of merozoites to a low potassium environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase to raise cytosolic cAMP levels and activate protein kinase A (PKA), which regulates microneme secretion. Additionally, cAMP regulates merozoite cytosolic calcium levels via an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) pathway. Both cAMP and calcium increases are essential to trigger microneme secretion. The identification of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways that regulate microneme secretion during invasion provides novel targets to inhibit blood stage parasite growth and prevent malaria. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the role of PfACβ, a soluble adenylyl cyclase, in regulating cAMP levels in Plasmodium merozoites. The results show that PfACβ activation leads to a rise in cytosolic cAMP levels and activation of PKA, which regulates microneme secretion. The study highlights the importance of cAMP in the regulation of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of human erythrocytes.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ). A systematic review of 354 studies from 78 countries between 1989 and 2011 found high infection prevalence rates in numerous African, Asian, and South-American resource-poor countries. The meta-analysis revealed associations between S. stercoralis infection and HIV-infection ( OR: 2. 17, 95% CI: 1. 18–4. 01 ) and alcoholism ( OR: 6. 69, 95% CI: 1. 47–33. 8 ). Strongyloidiasis is prominent in several risk groups, including refugees and immigrants, and remains an issue in developed countries for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from endemic areas. The study highlights the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings and integration into global helminth control. Country-wide estimates of S. stercoralis infection risk in the general population and the association between S. stercoralis prevalence and different risk groups were obtained through a Bayesian meta-analysis. The results underscore that S. stercoralis must not be neglected and that adequate information on prevalence is still lacking from many countries.
This study investigates the role of stochastic noise in cultured circadian reporter cells and its impact on population-level bioluminescence recordings. The authors demonstrate that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise. They show that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level, and that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators. Using a mathematical model, the authors confirm that changes in damping rate can be explained by single-cell noise. The study also applies this method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. The results suggest that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. This study highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly in the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics. The authors provide a method for estimating changes to stochastic noise from population-level circadian bioluminescence recordings, which can be applied to future and existing high-throughput circadian screens.
The recent rise in antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria necessitates the development of new approaches to drug-target selection and drug development. Targeting the mechanisms of action of proteins involved in bacterial cell division, such as the essential cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, is a promising strategy. The allosteric inhibitor PC190723 has shown in vitro activity on Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activities, but the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. This study examined the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket using PocketFEATURE, a statistical method that scores the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. The study predicts that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state and that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. The findings demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, providing important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors. The results also highlight the potential of PocketFEATURE to aid in the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.
A novel co-crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains of HIV-2 integrase (IN) in complex with the integrase binding domain (IBD) of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) has been determined. The structure reveals primarily charge-charge interactions between the N-terminal domain (NTD) of IN and the IBD of LEDGF. A constellation of acidic residues on the NTD is characteristic of lentiviral INs, and mutations of the positively charged residues on the IBD severely affect interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. The novel NTD-IBD contacts are critical for stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and for its function during the early steps of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the new structural details enabled the engineering of a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. The findings provide a structural basis for the high-affinity lentiviral IN-LEDGF interaction and pave the way for the development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy. The study also highlights the importance of the NTD-IBD interface in the functional lentivirus-host interaction and demonstrates that mutations in this region can significantly affect the interaction between IN and LEDGF.
Biomedical researchers investigated the evolution and phenotypic selection of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumors. They developed a cellular automaton model to track the temporal evolution of CSCs, which are responsible for initiating and sustaining tumors. The model explored various cell traits, including cell migration, spontaneous cell death, symmetric CSC division, and telomere length and erosion. The study found that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, with early increases in proliferation potential yielding larger populations of non-stem cancer cells that compete with CSCs and inhibit their division. Conversely, a reduction in proliferation potential loosens this inhibition and facilitates frequent CSC division. The sub-population of CSCs becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population-level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. The study suggests that the clonal diversity captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes. The researchers identified a set of orthogonal cell kinetics, including cell migration rate, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric CSC division, which modulate tumor progression. They found that increased cell migration and symmetric CSC division always lead to accelerated tumor growth, while increased cell death counteracts cancer stem cell confinement and promotes self-metastatic tumor expansion. The study highlights the complex interplay of these dynamics and the need for further investigation into the combinations of simultaneously evolving kinetics that yield the most aggressive tumor clones.
The article presents a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, with a focus on the role of spatial heterogeneity within the human population. The authors use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios and derive analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction and the waiting time to a successful emergence event. They also derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. The results suggest that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions and the risk of emergence per introduction. The study finds that for plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. The authors conclude that only the most remote rural communities would be subject to epidemiological isolation, and that factors such as human contact patterns and other host heterogeneity may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events. The study validates its results with stochastic simulations of simple village-city models as an example of interconnected communities within a spatially structured population. The findings have implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections, suggesting that the biology of the novel pathogen determines the emergence process and that a threshold exists where spatial heterogeneity effectively does not matter any more.
The study analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected over a 34-year period from North American migratory birds. The researchers used a Bayesian statistical framework to investigate viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment patterns. The results show that the host population of Charadriiformes in Delaware Bay does not significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. The study found that while AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, the long-term persistence of AIV is independent of bird flyways, with migration between populations occurring throughout North America. The analysis of long-term surveillance data provides insights for developing predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. The study also highlights the importance of Anseriformes' social behavior in the persistence of the virus population, as breeding birds converging in Alberta facilitate the spread and generation of influenza virus genetic diversity. The results suggest that the site at Delaware Bay, where hundreds of thousands of migrating Charadriiformes stopover annually, is a hotspot for avian influenza A viruses.
A novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, has been generated that shows heterosubtypic cross-reactive neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition of influenza A viruses. The antibody targets antigenic site B of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which is shared among various HA subtypes. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), MAb S139/1 demonstrated broad reactivity to HA subtypes H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. The antibody also showed neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition activities against specific strains of H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S139/1 were selected from the A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2), A/Adachi/2/57 (H2N2), and A/WSN/33 (H1N1) strains. Sequence analysis of the HA genes of these escape mutants revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193 (H3 numbering). A molecular modeling study showed that these amino acids are located on the globular head of the HA and form a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain of HA. Passive immunization of mice with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection. These results suggest that MAb S139/1 binds to a common antigenic site shared among various HA subtypes and neutralizes viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting viral attachment to cells. The study supports the notion that cross-reactive antibodies play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection and highlights the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.
A three-year cohort study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adult Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia, where the initial prevalence of S. stercoralis infection was 35.3%. Participants were treated with ivermectin and followed up at 6 months and 3 years post-treatment. The results showed that ivermectin treatment was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection, with a sustained fall from 35.3% to 5.8% at 3 years post-treatment (p < 0.001). The use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was also found to be valid in this setting. However, a small group of subjects with persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment was identified. The study suggests that control of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort may be feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. The findings of this study provide evidence that a "case finding and treatment" approach can be effective in controlling chronic S. stercoralis infection in an adult Aboriginal population. The prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort fell to 1.4% 3 years after treatment, underscoring the success of this treatment strategy.
The study investigated the phenomenon of prion strain interference, where one prion strain can inhibit the conversion of another prion strain. Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. The research aimed to determine whether two long-incubation period strains can interfere with each other. The study used animal bioassays and protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi) to examine the interactions between co-infecting strains. The results showed that co-infection of animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains failed to identify evidence of strain interference. Additionally, PMCAsi indicated that both co-infecting strains were amplifying independently, suggesting that the lack of strain interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells but is an inherent property of the strains involved. The study also found that long-incubation period strains contained relatively higher levels of remaining PrPC compared to short-incubation period strains, which may contribute to their ability to amplify independently. This observation changes the paradigm of prion strain interactions and has implications for interspecies transmission and the emergence of prion strains from a mixture. The findings suggest that not all prion strain combinations result in interference, and strain diversity in naturally-infected animals may be greater than previously thought.
A comprehensive ensemble model has been proposed to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation. The model considers both order-disorder and order-order transitions and reveals that the order-order transition ( MWC pathway ) has a higher probability than the order-disorder transition ( EAM pathway ) in affording allosteric effects, especially strong allostery. This suggests that the prevalence of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDPs/IDRs ) in allosteric regulation is more complicated than previously thought. The ensemble model also provides an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable for allostery. This finding has implications for the rational design of allosteric drugs. The study highlights the importance of considering both order-disorder and order-order transitions in understanding the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation. The results of the comprehensive ensemble model challenge the previous view that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing allosteric coupling. The study suggests that the prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation is not solely due to their capacity to endow allostery, but also due to other factors. Further work combining experimental data and bioinformatics analyses is needed to compare the importance of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation and to determine whether IDPs/IDRs are more or less prevalent in allostery than ordered proteins.
The study investigated the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and its potential involvement in prostate cancer progression. β-Catenin is a protein essential for various developmental processes and has been implicated in tumorigenesis in several tissues, including prostate cancer. However, its specific function in prostate cancer remains unclear. Using in vivo genetic studies in mice, the researchers found that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin regulates the number of progenitor cells in the epithelial buds and controls a network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. In contrast, overexpression of β-Catenin, achieved through protein stabilization, promoted the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. Furthermore, β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss drove progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia. These findings demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that high levels of this protein can drive squamous fate differentiation. The study also shows that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease, providing novel insights into cancer progression pathways that give rise to lethal prostate disease in humans.
Informed consent is a crucial aspect of biomedical research, particularly in low-income settings where disease burden is high. A study conducted in southern Ethiopia aimed to explore factors influencing the informed consent process for a family-based genetic study on podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis). The researchers used a qualitative approach, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoconiosis patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, and community leaders. The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and presentation techniques significantly impacted comprehension of research information. Locally trusted individuals and community sensitization were identified as optimal means of communication. However, prevailing poverty, lack of alternative treatment facilities, and trust in the local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on podoconiosis prevention and treatment posed barriers to obtaining genuine informed consent. The study suggests that researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes on a study-by-study basis to provide appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and support voluntary decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the social and cultural context of the community and potential research participants before seeking informed consent. The study also emphasizes the need to consider local norms and values when designing consent processes, such as using locally used terms to explain genetic concepts and involving reputable local intermediaries in the consent process.
A mathematical model of T cell proliferation was developed to investigate the dynamics of T lymphocyte proliferation across their differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen of mice. Single-cell multicolour flow cytometry analysis was used to quantify the incorporation of a thymidine analogue during S phase after pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo. The model, based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), simulated the evolution of single cell behaviour during various durations of labelling, allowing for the estimation of proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in sub-populations. The model was validated with other durations of pulse/chase experiments and revealed that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with a specific "signature" that depends on genetic origins, cell differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen, and is altered with age. The study found that genetic origin and age drive a particular "signature" of proliferation and cycle phase durations, according to T cell differentiation stage and T cell lineage. FVB mice were found to have significantly lower rates of T cell proliferation than C57BL/6 mice in both the thymus and spleen. The results provide a detailed proliferation assessment and cell quantification in sub-populations of T cells, along their differentiation from the thymus to the spleen, and through aging. The model allows for the inference of proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures.
The study reports the generation and characterization of the first pathological mutation in a mitochondrial tRNA gene in mouse cells, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene. This mutation recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation described in humans, an m. 4290T>C transition affecting the human mt-Ti gene. The pathogenic molecular mechanism induced by both the mouse and human mutations is a high frequency of abnormal folding of the tRNAIle that cannot be charged with isoleucine. Cells harboring the mouse or human mutant tRNA exhibit exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in mitochondrial ROS production as a compensatory response. This response partially compensates for the deficiency. The study proposes that the nature of the pathogenic mechanism combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation. The findings suggest that the fixation of two alleles that are individually deleterious can proceed in two steps and not require the simultaneous mutation of both. The study also highlights the different nature of mutations affecting protein-coding genes versus tRNA genes, with consequences for understanding pathology and evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs. The results demonstrate the positive implication of ROS-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in the expression of mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutations found in human patients. This mechanism may generate an epistatic-like effect, where a partial suppression of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs is exerted.
The study investigated the dosage regulation of the active X chromosome in human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes instead of the typical two. The researchers used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in triploid cells with one or two active X chromosomes. The results showed that the average X:autosome expression ratio was lower in triploid cells with one active X (0.81-0.84) and higher in triploid cells with two active X's (1.32-1.4) compared to diploid cells. This suggests that X-linked gene expression does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor and is not adjusted to achieve a perfect balance. The study found that absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy were similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no apparent global effect on autosomal expression. In triploid cells with two active X's, the data supported a basic doubling of X-linked gene expression. However, in triploid cells with a single active X, X-linked gene expression was adjusted upward, presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression is critical. The study also found that a small subset of genes (approximately 7%) had expression levels proportional to the number of autosomal sets. Overall, the results indicate that X-linked gene expression is up-regulated approximately two-fold in triploid cultures with two active X chromosomes, but is adjusted further upward in triploid cultures with a single active X.
The dN/dS ratio, a widely used measure of evolutionary pressures on proteins, was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences. However, it is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, where the differences among sequences represent segregating polymorphisms rather than substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. This study investigates the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection and finds that it is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Furthermore, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function within a population, making it impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements. The results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples. In particular, standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are extremely sensitive to violation of the assumption of divergent lineages, and the power of the dN/dS statistic to detect positive selection is low when the majority of sites in the protein evolve under purifying selection. The study's findings highlight the need to understand the relationship between selection pressures and the dN/dS statistic for samples from a single population.
The effect of natural selection on linked neutral divergence across species has been a topic of debate in evolutionary biology. Studies have shown that neutral genetic diversity within species is reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection, but the impact of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence between species remains unclear. This study investigates whether natural selection can affect divergence between closely and distantly related species. The results show that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. Similarly, neutral divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for potential confounding factors. Coalescent models indicate that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome, even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism is small. The findings suggest that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. This has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
The study investigated the role of the CK2 kinase in the regulation of the Drosophila circadian oscillator. The results show that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes the CLOCK (CLK) activator, while also repressing its activity. Downregulation of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 leads to CLK degradation, even in the absence of PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins, which are known to inhibit CLK transcriptional activity. In contrast, the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. Furthermore, downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription. These findings indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The study suggests that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2 kinases. The results provide new insights into the regulation of the Drosophila circadian oscillator and highlight the complex interplay between CK2 and other kinases in controlling CLK function. The study also identifies CK2 as the first bona fide kinase of Drosophila CLK that plays a role in its degradation and hyperphosphorylation. The findings have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillations in Drosophila and potentially other organisms.
This study investigated the role of cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi and its invertebrate host, Rhodnius prolixus. T. cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, a significant public health problem in the Americas. The study found that treatment of T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors significantly decreased parasite adhesion to R. prolixus midgut, except for one inhibitor, CA074-OMe. Cystatin, a cysteine peptidase inhibitor, showed a dose-dependent reduction in parasite adhesion. The study also compared the adhesion rates of different T. cruzi isolates and found that the G isolate, which naturally possesses low levels of active cruzipain, adhered to a lesser extent compared to other isolates. Transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, and that have reduced levels of active cruzipain adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. The addition of exogenous cruzipain partially restored the adhesion of these parasites. In vivo colonization experiments revealed low levels of pCHAG parasites in comparison to wild-type. Parasites isolated after passage in the insect presented a drastic enhancement in the expression of surface cruzipain. These findings suggest that cruzipain contributes to the interaction of T. cruzi with the insect host, highlighting its potential as a target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes during mitosis, including centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation. However, the mechanisms that target and regulate this microtubule motor remain poorly understood. To identify potential regulators of cytoplasmic dynein, a genome-wide RNA interference library was used to screen a conditional Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature. This screen resulted in the isolation and characterization of twenty dynein-specific suppressor genes, which were found to suppress dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci. Twelve of these suppressor genes do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type worms. The suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, were found to localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains was found to suppress the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. These findings suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, programmed genome rearrangements ( PGR ) occur during somatic differentiation, where DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) drive the precise elimination of at least 45, 000 germline sequences ( Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES ). The development of the somatic nucleus involves a cut-and-close mechanism, where a domesticated transposase, PiggyMac, is essential for DNA cleavage, and Ligase IV, a component of the non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) pathway, mediates DSB repair at excision sites. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR, the role of Ku, the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair, was investigated. Two Ku70 and three Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the P. tetraurelia genome, with Ku70a and Ku80c being produced during sexual processes and localizing specifically in the developing new somatic nucleus. RNA interference revealed that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus. Furthermore, PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. The Ku70a/Ku80c heterodimer co-purifies with PiggyMac in a heterologous system, indicating that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.
This study investigated the early mechanisms of pathobiology in prion-infected mice by examining the transcriptional temporal dynamics in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Using laser capture microdissection, the researchers isolated CA1 neurons and analyzed their gene expression during the pre-clinical phase of the disease. The results showed that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity, with a major cluster of genes altered during pre-clinical disease. This cluster includes genes involved in synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes related to neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered, leading to a general decline in gene expression for synaptic proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-140-5p followed concomitant patterns of expression. The study suggests that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response mediated by synaptic NMDA receptor activity, which initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response is terminated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms in the infected hippocampus, indicating a critical juncture in the disease. The findings provide new insights into the early mechanisms of pathobiology in prion disease and highlight the potential for manipulating early neuroprotective pathways to redress the balance between degeneration and survival.
A Petri net model of granulomatous inflammation has been developed to simulate the progression of experimental visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani infection in mice. The model accurately recapitulates the formation and function of granulomas, which are focal accumulations of inflammatory cells in the liver where the parasite is eventually eliminated. The model was extensively validated by comparison with data from experimental studies in mice and was found to robustly predict changes in cellular composition within granulomas over time. In silico experiments using the model revealed a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity in terms of anti-leishmanial activity. Furthermore, simulations of IL-10 gene deficiency in various lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations suggested a dominant local regulatory role for IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma. The model only simulates events within the granuloma that lead to control of parasite load and does not account for potential regulatory effects of IL-10 outside this environment. The model was parameterized using data from real-time intravital imaging and analysis of disaggregated liver tissue from mice infected with Leishmania donovani. The results of this study provide new insights into the aspects of granuloma function that are currently intractable in vivo and highlight the importance of T cell-derived cytokines in maintaining the balance of immunity during subclinical disease.
The article presents a study on the computational capabilities of transcriptional regulatory networks in gene expression. The authors propose that the transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. They demonstrate that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation can approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters, which can be independently tuned. The authors also show that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. Furthermore, they consider the possibility of approximating analytic functions by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. The study suggests that transcriptional regulatory networks can perform computations more sophisticated than simple logical operations, and implies new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks. The findings have implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and the design of biochemical systems. The authors also discuss the possibility of approximating more complex functions, such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions, but note that this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes.
A recent outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Northeast region of Brazil has been found to be caused by the simultaneous circulation of two distinct genotypes: the Asian/Caribbean genotype and the African ECSA genotype. Genome sequencing of clinical samples revealed that both genotypes are present in the region, with evidence of coinfection in at least six individuals. This finding suggests that coinfection by different CHIKV genotypes may be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas. The study used an in-house developed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to directly detect multiple known CHIKV genotypes from clinical positive samples. The results demonstrate that both genotypes have expanded their ranges and are now cocirculating in the Northeast region of Brazil. This is the first time that simultaneous infection by two different CHIKV genotypes has been reported in the same region. The study highlights the importance of considering the possibility of coinfection by different genotypes in the human population when understanding CHIKV epidemiology. The findings have significant implications for public health efforts to control and prevent the spread of CHIKV in Brazil and other regions where the virus is endemic.
The bacterial modulator H-NS plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to external stimuli, such as osmolarity and temperature. Recent studies have shown that H-NS targets both core genome and horizontally acquired genes (HGT) and silences their expression. However, a new study reveals that H-NS discriminates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. Specifically, plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins have evolved to selectively silence HGT genes without interfering with core genome regulation. In contrast, chromosomally-encoded H-NS requires a helper protein, Hha, to differentially modulate HGT and core genes. H-NS-Hha complexes tightly silence HGT DNA, while H-NS homoligomers modulate core genes. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. This unique feature of the H-NS system in enteric bacteria allows for the selective discrimination between core and HGT DNA, which may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form and provide a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization. The study provides evidence that H-NS interacts with Hha proteins to specifically silence HGT genes, rather than core genome genes, and highlights the importance of the H-NS system in regulating gene expression in enteric bacteria.
This study investigated the gene expression profiles of Leishmania species, which cause a range of disease phenotypes in humans, to identify potential factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity. Genome sequencing of L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis revealed highly conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between species. Customized oligonucleotide microarrays were used to confirm that all differentially distributed genes are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with only a few subject to regulation at the RNA level. The study found that approximately 9% of genes are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species identified conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. The study also investigated the influence of host immune competence on parasite gene expression, comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from wild-type and immunologically compromised mice. The results showed that parasite dissemination is enhanced in immunocompromised mice, but parasite RNA expression profiles remain unperturbed. These findings support the hypothesis that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level. The study suggests that species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes.
A novel LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) assay, named LAMPhimerus, has been developed for the detection of Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples. Amphimeriasis is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp., which has been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador. Current diagnosis relies on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but this method lacks sensitivity and can be confounded by other liver and intestinal flukes. To address this, a LAMP assay was designed to target a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region. The assay was optimized using DNA from adult worms recovered from animals and was shown to be highly specific and sensitive, with a detection limit of 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing of 44 human stool samples from endemic areas revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively, for the LAMPhimerus assay. The LAMP assay was found to be more effective than conventional PCR in detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in stool samples. The LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas. Further large-scale studies are needed to assess the applicability of this novel diagnostic tool. The LAMPhimerus assay offers a specific and sensitive method for detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples, providing a valuable tool for improving the diagnosis of amphimeriasis.
The study reveals a non-canonical role of the SNARE protein Ykt6 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. While Syntaxin17 ( Syx17 ) forms a complex with Snap29 and Vamp7/8 to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion, Ykt6 is also required for autophagosome clearance. Loss of Ykt6 leads to large-scale accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes. Ykt6 localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes and forms a SNARE complex with Syx17 and Snap29. However, this complex is less stable than the Syx17-Snap29-Vamp7 bundle. Ykt6 can be outcompeted from this complex by Vamp7, and overexpression of Vamp7 rescues the fusion defect in Ykt6 loss-of-function cells. A point mutant form of Ykt6 with an RQ amino acid change in the zero ionic layer retains normal autophagic activity and restores full viability in mutant animals. These data suggest that Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion and Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in this process. Ykt6 and Vamp7 are mutually exclusive subunits in the Syx17-Snap29 complex and are both required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Ykt6 is highly mobile and can shuttle between vesicles and the cytosol, temporarily stabilizing the Syx17-Snap29 SNARE complex bound to HOPS until Vamp7 enters the fusion site. Overexpression of Vamp7 restores autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Ykt6 loss-of-function cells.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the host innate immune defense against bacterial infections. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, can cause opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. NTHI's ability to evade the bactericidal effects of host-derived AMPs is a key aspect of its virulence. The Sap (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) ABC transporter in NTHI enables the bacterium to resist AMPs, but the mechanism of this resistance was previously undefined. The periplasmic binding protein SapA was found to bind AMPs and was required for NTHI virulence in vivo. This study demonstrates that SapA directly counteracts AMP lethality during NTHI infection by delivering AMPs to the Sap inner membrane complex for transport into the bacterial cytoplasm, where they are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptidase activity. In contrast, AMPs accumulated in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. These findings support a novel mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs, which reduces periplasmic and inner membrane accumulation of these host defense peptides. This study provides the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to bacterial virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo. The Sap ABC transporter plays a critical role in NTHI's ability to evade the host immune response and cause disease.
The study explores the role of active degradation in the regulation of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA in Escherichia coli. MarA has a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to Lon protease activity and regulates over 60 downstream targets involved in antibiotic resistance and stress response. The researchers modified MarA's half-life using CRISPRi to knock down the protease that targets it or engineered MarA to protect it from degradation. The results show that active degradation affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. Increasing MarA's half-life increases the maximum coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but the rate at which the wild-type and MarA fusion generate coordination between downstream genes is different. The study suggests that active degradation may allow for a more responsive and agile signaling network or enable a few remaining cells to rapidly regenerate diversity following antibiotic challenge. The findings highlight the utility of active degradation in shaping the regulation of MarA and its downstream targets, and demonstrate that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist in the context of multi-gene regulation.
A recent study investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57BL/6 mice. In a previous study, MKP-2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to Leishmania mexicana infection due to increased Arginase-1 levels and reduced iNOS activity in macrophages, as well as a diminished TH1 response. In contrast, the current study found that MKP-2 deficient mice infected with L. major exhibited a healing response similar to wild-type mice, with no significant difference in lesion size or parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses revealed a reduced TH1 response in MKP-2 deficient mice, characterized by lower levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as lower antigen-stimulated spleen cell IFN-γ production. However, MKP-2 deficient mice also showed reduced levels of IL-4 production and parasite-specific IgG1 in the serum, indicating a general T cell hypo-responsiveness. The overall TH1/TH2 balance was unaltered in MKP-2 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, MKP-2 deficient macrophages were equally effective at controlling parasite growth as wild-type macrophages when activated with LPS/IFN-γ. These findings suggest that the absence of MKP-2 does not alter the disease phenotype in L. major infection, despite a reduced TH1 response and increased susceptibility of MKP-2 deficient macrophages to parasite infection.
The mammalian pancreas is a branched organ with a network of ducts that undergoes a transition from unconnected microlumens to a mesh of interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. This ductal remodeling process is poorly understood, both on a microscopic and macroscopic level. Researchers have quantified the network properties at different developmental stages and found that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each stage. The network properties change with time toward the most economical and optimized delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. Using in silico modeling, the steps of pancreatic network development were deconstructed into two simple rules likely to be conserved for many other glands. The early stage of the network is explained by noisy, redundant duct connection as new microlumens form, while the later transition is attributed to pruning of the network based on the flux of fluid running through the pancreatic network into the duodenum. The study reveals that the pancreatic ductal system has stereotypic traits at each stage and that its remodeling can be quantified by standard network measures. The findings suggest that the creation of the early network from E10. 5 to E12. 5 can be explained by noisy, redundant duct formation as new microlumens form, while the remodeling of the ductal network from a plexus to a ramified treelike organ is attributed to the pruning of the network based on fluid flux.
Kinesin motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that mediate directed movement along microtubules. To determine an atomic-level model of kinesin action, it is essential to characterize these distinct conformations and their interconversion mechanism. A comprehensive principal component analysis of 114 experimental structures and conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations were performed to map the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain. The results show that all experimental structures reside in one of three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, most notably the microtubule binding α4–α5, loop8 subdomain, and α2b-β4-β6-β7 motor domain tip. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free Eg5 indicate that all three nucleotide states can sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. The simulations also reveal differences in the dynamic coupling of distal sites, with the neck-linker, loop8, and α4–α5 subdomain displaying correlated motions in ATP-bound simulations that are absent in ADP-bound simulations. The results suggest that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. The simulations also highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites.
A new computational approach has been developed to infer gene transcription levels from bioluminescent data generated by the Lux system, a widely used gene expression reporter. The Lux system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for eukaryotic cells and can be used for whole-cell biosensors or in real-time with live animals without the need for euthanasia. However, correct interpretation of bioluminescent data is limited due to nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. To address this limitation, a new mathematical model has been created that includes the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for all reactions, as well as synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model is calibrated with new experimental data for the LuxAB and Fre reactions from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxEC. The model shows that predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output similar to those seen in some experimental data sets. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, it is possible to reverse-engineer promoter activity from bioluminescence. This approach can benefit all users of Lux technology by providing a more accurate interpretation of bioluminescent data and enabling the inference of gene transcription levels.
The crystal structure of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with the capsid binder GPP3 has been elucidated, revealing the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. This structural information was used to perform in silico docking of two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, which were found to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with potentially interesting pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis of the structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity was also conducted. The results showed that the hydrophobic pocket below the canyon in VP1 is an interesting target for the development of novel inhibitors that target the early stage of enterovirus infection. In silico docking of NLD and ALD into the CVA16 crystal structure demonstrated a similar binding mode to GPP3. The structural and in silico results were analyzed in the context of the antiviral activity of these inhibitors against a wide range of enteroviruses, showing their potency and broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Additionally, the activity of these inhibitors was tested against a panel of enteroviruses, and structural comparisons were used to correlate structural features with differences in antiviral activity. The results reinforce the potential of NLD as a candidate for a hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) drug. Good anti-poliovirus activity was observed for all three capsid binders, with the highest EC50 for PV1, which has a Leu residue at the bottom of the pocket, reducing the energy of binding compared to PV2 and PV3, which have a Phe.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the serpin Necrotic plays a crucial role in regulating the humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections. Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated, which signals through the Toll receptor, resulting in the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat-body and their export to the haemolymph. Necrotic is synthesized in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis, researchers demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein HRS. Mutations that block late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family identifies Lipophorin Receptor-1 (LpR1) as an enhancer of the immune response. Uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades. This study identifies the cells and receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster.
This study investigated the role of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in the sea urchin larva. Nodal signaling is known to prevent the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment was unclear. The researchers found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, and is required for the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. In contrast, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. The study suggests that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, indicating that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes. The results also show that BMP signaling is required for proper LR patterning and the expression of left-sided genes in the sea urchin embryo. Furthermore, the study reveals a positive role of BMP signaling on Nodal gene expression, which is also observed in vertebrates. The findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in the sea urchin embryo and highlight the importance of BMP signaling in left-sided development.
The onset of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) lytic infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle. Infected G0/G1 cells support viral immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceed to the G1/S boundary where they finally arrest. In contrast, S/G2 cells can be infected but effectively block IE gene expression, which is not relieved until host cells have divided and reentered G1. During latent infection, IE gene expression is also inhibited, and for reactivation to occur, this block must be overcome. The study found that the block to IE gene expression during S and G2 phases can be overcome by both genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, pointing to the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression strictly requires p53, and the requirement for the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 downstream of p53 suggests a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2. Treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53. Importantly, CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 (NT2) cells. The study suggests that a timely block to CDK activity not only secures phase specificity of the cell cycle-dependent HCMV IE gene expression program but also plays a hitherto unrecognized role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
This study investigated the role of cell-intrinsic immune responses in dendritic cells (DCs) from HIV-1 elite controllers (ECs) in facilitating HIV-1-specific T cell immunity. ECs are a subgroup of patients who can control HIV-1 replication without antiretroviral therapy. The study found that exposure of DCs from ECs to HIV-1 led to a rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of several interferon-stimulated effector genes. This cell-intrinsic immune response was associated with reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and accumulation of viral reverse transcripts. The emergence of these responses was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of viral reverse transcription or siRNA-mediated silencing of the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. Importantly, improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in DCs from ECs translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. The study suggests that cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells plays a crucial role in the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells. These findings have implications for the development of immunologic approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention, particularly for vaccine candidates that rely on dendritic cells for inducing HIV-1-specific immune responses.
A novel buoyancy-based screening method has been developed to identify Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat. This approach has led to the identification of 66 genes, including Sir2, a sirtuin family member, which regulates the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. Sir2 knockdown in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels, and genetic mosaics demonstrate that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. Changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes in Sir2 mutants suggest a shift away from catabolism. Notably, Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild-type larvae under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided, indicating a Sir2-mediated pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation. The findings suggest that Sir2 is a key regulator in the switch from utilizing ingested nutrients to stored fat as an energy source. This study highlights the potential of genetic screens in invertebrates, such as Drosophila, to identify genes and pathways that regulate fat storage, which are likely to be conserved in humans. The results also implicate Sir2 as a negative regulator of fat storage in Drosophila larvae, with a cell-autonomous function in the fat body.
This study investigated the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during the first asymmetric embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers recorded the first embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species using time-lapse DIC videomicroscopy. The results showed that all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, but exhibited large intra- and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation each evolved independently. This finding contrasts with expectations based on C. elegans studies and reveals previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics. The study demonstrates that the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode evolution, but the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. The results suggest that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift, like other developmental processes. The study provides a powerful collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of various cellular processes across species.
Bacterial Regulon Evolution: Distinct Responses and Roles for the Identical OmpR Proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli in the Acid Stress Response
   . Typhimurium and Escherichia coli have identical OmpR proteins, but regulatory specialization has resulted in different environmental triggers of OmpR expression and largely divergent OmpR regulons. OmpR mRNA and OmpR protein levels are elevated by acid pH in Salmonella Typhimurium but not in E. coli. This differential expression pattern is due to differences in the promoter regions of the ompR genes and the E. coli ompR orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introduction of the appropriate sequences from S. Typhimurium. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps with that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that E. coli does not have. OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Typhimurium as a result of acid stress and is a requirement for optimal expression of its virulence genes. The genomic targets of OmpR do not share a strong nucleotide sequence consensus, suggesting that the ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets and its preference for relaxed DNA allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress.
The intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis has been found to secrete a novel protein, named Nuclear Effector (NUE), which contains a SET domain characteristic of histone methyltransferases. NUE is secreted via a type III secretion mechanism and translocates to the host cell nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. In vitro methylation assays confirmed that NUE is a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself (automethylation). Automethylation was found to enhance NUE's enzymatic activity towards histones. Mutants deficient in automethylation demonstrated reduced activity towards histones, suggesting that automethylation plays a crucial role in NUE's function. This study is the first to describe a bacterial effector protein that directly targets mammalian histones. NUE's enzymatic activity was found to be specific to mammalian histones, with a preference for histone H2B over the chlamydial histone Hc1. The study's findings suggest that NUE plays a significant role in the pathogenicity of Chlamydia trachomatis by modifying host cell chromatin. Further research is needed to determine the genes regulated by NUE translocation in the nucleus during Chlamydia infection.
This study investigated the potential role of recessive genetic effects on human height by analyzing genome-wide homozygosity in over 35,000 individuals from 21 different population samples. The results showed a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared to the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained significant after controlling for socio-economic status, a potential confounder. However, the effect size differed significantly among populations, suggesting true biological heterogeneity. The study used three alternative estimates of genomic homozygosity, each capturing a different aspect of the phenomenon, and found that all three measures were strongly correlated but also showed important differences. The results indicate that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height. The study's methodology is generally applicable to heritable quantitative traits, paving the way for an investigation into inbreeding effects and genetic architecture on a range of traits of biomedical importance. The findings provide evidence for a polygenic recessive component to the genetic architecture of height, supporting Fisher's theory that the heritability of height results from the combined effects of many genetic variants of individually small effect size.
The study investigated the relationship between peripheral blood monocyte (MO) subpopulations and anti-parasitic activity in patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using flow cytometry, the researchers characterized the phenotype of MO from healthy malaria-exposed individuals and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria. The results showed that certain MO subpopulations, specifically CD16+ MO and CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO, were present in high numbers in most patients at the time of admission. Furthermore, the expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14high (hi) MO subset defined two subgroups of patients that differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) activity. Patients with high percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and high mean levels of ADCI activity had lower blood parasitemias compared to those with low numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO. The study also found that circulating MO expressing CCR2, CX3CR1, CD56, mTNF-α, and mIFN-γ were associated with lower parasitemias and strong ADCI activity. The results suggest that discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity, providing new insights into the complex relationships between MO phenotype and functional activity in patients and healthy malaria-exposed individuals.
A cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection and the abundance and function of HIV target cells in the blood and foreskin of HIV-uninfected Ugandan men. The study found that S. mansoni infection was associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets, including Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, in the blood, but not in the foreskin. Specifically, S. mansoni-infected men had higher frequencies of systemic Th1 cells (22.9% vs. 16.5%), Th17 cells (2.3% vs. 1.5%), and Th22 cells (0.5% vs. 0.3%) compared to uninfected men. Additionally, Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function, producing multiple cytokines at a higher rate (28.1% vs. 16.3%). However, these immune alterations were not observed in the foreskin tissue. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may increase the abundance and function of HIV target cells in the blood, but this effect does not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual Ugandan men. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between S. mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility.
This study investigated the effects of Wolbachia depletion on filarial nematodes using whole mount confocal microscopy. Wolbachia is an endosymbiont that maintains a mutualistic relationship with filarial nematodes, and its depletion has been proposed as a novel approach for treating filarial diseases. The results show that depletion of Wolbachia leads to extensive apoptosis in adult germline cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae ( L4 ). Apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment, suggesting a non-cell autonomous effect. The hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbachia, do not undergo apoptosis, but do experience disruption of the cytoskeleton following Wolbachia depletion. The pattern of apoptosis correlates with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following depletion of Wolbachia, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. These effects are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. The study provides a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular pantothenate for proliferation, which is converted into coenzyme A (CoA) via a five-enzyme pathway, starting with pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, such as pantothenol and CJ-15,801, target CoA biosynthesis/utilization, but their mechanism of action remains unknown. Continuous drug-pressuring with these analogues generated resistant parasite lines with mutations in one of two putative PanK genes, Pfpank1. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that these mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, indicating that Pfpank1 codes for a functional PanK essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. This suggests that different pantothenate analogue classes have different mechanisms of action, with some inhibiting CoA biosynthesis and others inhibiting CoA-utilizing enzymes. The study provides genetic evidence validating the importance of metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in their antiplasmodial activity. The findings have implications for the development of new antiplasmodial agents targeting the CoA biosynthetic pathway.
Genome-wide association studies (GWA) were conducted in African American individuals from four cohorts to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time on the electrocardiogram. The studies used the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray and imputed 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. A strong signal was observed in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, with genome-wide significant association (p<2.5×10−8) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans (beta = 5.1 msec per minor allele, 95% CI = 4.1–6.1, p = 3×10−23). This SNP was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size (p for heterogeneity <0.001) and variability explained (0.5%). Further meta-analysis identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5 that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration (13.3 msec, p = 0.009) in one but not the other three cohorts. These findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
A host small GTP-binding protein ARL8 plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus. ToMV replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes, and previous studies have shown that a host seven-pass transmembrane protein TOM1 is necessary for efficient ToMV multiplication. This study demonstrates that ARL8, along with TOM1, is co-purified with a FLAG epitope-tagged ToMV 180K replication protein from solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco cells. Immunopurification of solubilized membranes from ToMV-infected cells that expressed FLAG-tagged ARL8 resulted in the co-purification of ToMV 130K and 180K replication proteins and TOM1, and the purified fraction showed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that transcribed ToMV RNA. In contrast, TOM1 co-purified with FLAG-tagged ARL8 less efficiently from uninfected cells, suggesting that a complex containing ToMV replication proteins, TOM1, and ARL8 is formed on membranes in infected cells. Simultaneous mutations in two specific ARL8 genes completely inhibited tobamovirus multiplication in Arabidopsis thaliana. In an in vitro ToMV RNA translation-replication system, the lack of either TOM1 or ARL8 proteins inhibited the production of replicative-form RNA, indicating that TOM1 and ARL8 are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, co-expression of ToMV 130K protein with TOM1 and ARL8 in yeast resulted in the detection of RNA 5′-capping activity in the membrane fraction, which was undetectable or very weak when the 130K protein was expressed alone or with either TOM1 or ARL8. These results suggest that TOM1 and ARL8 are components of ToMV RNA replication complexes and play crucial roles in activating the replication proteins' RNA synthesizing and capping functions.
Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in various brain systems, including the locust olfactory circuit. Two basic motifs of inhibition have been identified: feed-forward ( FF ) and feedback ( FB ) inhibition. In the locust, a subset of lateral horn interneurons ( LHNs ) was thought to provide FF inhibition onto Kenyon cells ( KCs ) to maintain their sparse firing. However, a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron ( GGN ), has been found to be the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and its inhibition is mediated by a FB loop including KCs and the GGN. To clarify the differences between FF and FB inhibition, a model of the locust olfactory system was developed. The results showed that both inhibitory motifs can maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition can create a phase response consistent with in vivo data. The findings suggest that GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to KCs. The study highlights the importance of understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity, which could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks. The results also indicate that GGN-mediated inhibition affects both KCs and LHNs, although they respond differently to odor presentations. Overall, the study provides general rules for FF versus FB inhibition and sheds light on the role of GGN in the locust olfactory circuit.
A novel dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay has been developed for the diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans. The assay combines two complementary techniques: a probe-based (TaqMan) RT-qPCR for detecting the rabies virus species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). The performance parameters of this combined assay were evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all the genetic variability encountered at the viral species level. The method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples, including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies. The assay detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and interest of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. The method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant, useful, and validated tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance. The assay has high sensitivity and specificity, and is able to detect a large panel of animal lyssavirus samples.
In the Eastern Region of Ghana, an outbreak of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in 2007. To mitigate this issue, a control trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse flies. Two villages were selected, one as a control and the other as an experimental site where 24 pigsties were protected with insecticide-treated mosquito fences. The fences, made of 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m2 deltamethrin and a UV protector, were attached to surrounding timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse densities using geo-referenced bi-conical traps showed a reduction of over 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse population in the control village remained unaffected, displaying only seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in pigs was also significantly reduced in the protected village, decreasing from 76% to 16% after three months and to 8% after six months, compared to 84% and 60% in the control group, respectively. These findings suggest that insecticide-treated mosquito fences are an effective and sustainable method for controlling tsetse flies and reducing the risk of trypanosomiasis in domestic pigs in resource-poor areas of Ghana.
A survey of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 found a lack of reproducibility and transparency in the scientific literature. Only one study provided a full protocol, and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, with only four identified, and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest, although there was a significant decrease in the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014. In contrast, the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts or no conflicts increased over the same period. Articles published in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack information on funding and to have private funding compared to other fields. The study found no significant differences between replication, article citation for systematic review and/or meta-analysis, and statements of conflict. However, articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to not mention funding and less likely to have a PubMed Central reference number (PMCID) compared to other fields. The study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving reproducibility and transparency in the scientific literature.
During primary pneumonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, a biphasic progression occurs, with an initial pre-inflammatory phase allowing bacterial growth in the absence of host inflammation, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase characterized by extensive neutrophil influx, inflammatory cytokine storm, and severe tissue destruction. To investigate the early host cell targets of Y. pestis during primary pneumonic plague, a FRET-based probe was used to quantify the injection of effector proteins by the Y. pestis type III secretion system. The results show that Y. pestis targets alveolar macrophages early during infection of mice, followed by a switch in host cell preference to neutrophils. Depletion of approximately 92% of alveolar macrophages had little to no effect on bacterial burden in the lung, suggesting that macrophages are not involved in limiting Yersinia survival in the lung. In contrast, the ability of Y. pestis to create a localized protective environment in the lungs early during pneumonic plague suggests that it deactivates host innate immune responses. The study demonstrates that Y. pestis targets innate immune cell populations early in the lung via type III secretion of Yop effectors, and that neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth in the lung and is ultimately responsible for the severe inflammation during the lethal pro-inflammatory phase. These findings provide new insights into the early host cell targets of Y. pestis during primary pneumonic plague.
A study was conducted in an urban area in Southeast Brazil to evaluate the performance of serology in identifying asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) infection in a cohort of 136 participants with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected in 2001 and tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with three different antigens: Leishmania infantum and Leishmania amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The results were compared to molecular biology techniques, including PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L. infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L. donovani complex. The study found that kala-azar patients showed high reactivity in ELISAs, while asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against the antigens tested. The rK39 antigen showed higher specificity (73.7%) than Leishmania amazonensis (52.6%) and Leishmania infantum antigens (36.8%), but lower sensitivity (26.5%). The study concluded that serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which may lead to misclassification bias in population studies. The results suggest that studies using serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection may have had their results compromised. The study highlights the importance of using molecular techniques for accurate diagnosis of VL, particularly in asymptomatic cases.
This study employed microarray analysis to investigate the silencing of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells. The researchers used Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray platforms to monitor the expression of retrotransposons and identified the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in these cells. The study also revealed that multiple silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes, are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the analysis suggested that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms, and that a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms represses retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells. The study also identified new target retrotransposons for polycomb repressive complexes and Hdac1 histone deacetylase in mouse embryonic stem cells, and demonstrated that between one and two thirds of all retrotransposons in the mouse genome are represented by probes on the microarray platforms analyzed. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of retrotransposons in mammals and highlight the importance of multiple silencing mechanisms in protecting the mammalian genome from retrotransposition.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) plays a crucial role in mediating light control of flowering time. CRY2 interacts with CIB1, a bHLH protein, in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus T (FT). In vitro, CIB1 binds to the canonical E-box (CACGTG) with higher affinity than to non-canonical E-box (CANNTG) sequences. However, in vivo, CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which contains non-canonical E-box sequences. The study reveals that CRY2 also interacts with at least CIB5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or in response to other wavelengths of light. Genetic analysis demonstrates that CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. Furthermore, CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, which have a higher binding affinity to non-canonical E-box sequences than CIB homodimers. This heterodimerization explains why CIB1 and other CIBs bind to non-canonical E-boxes at the FT promoter in vivo. The expression of CIB proteins is specifically regulated by blue light, consistent with the hypothesis that different CIB proteins play similar roles in CRY2-mediated blue light signaling. The study demonstrates that CIBs function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and that different CIBs form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo.
An economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of overseas and domestic treatment and screening options for intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia. The study examined the costs and benefits of four interventions: no program, domestic screening and treatment, overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin, and overseas albendazole and domestic screening for Strongyloides. A decision tree model was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of these interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees. The results showed that the "No Program" option was the least expensive but also the least effective, with 145 outpatient cases, 4 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths discounted over a 60-year period. In contrast, the "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option was the most effective, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted. The study found that overseas presumptive treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduced the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare but potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis. The results suggest that overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin is the most effective option for reducing the burden of intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia.
A new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, has been discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This parasite exhibits a unique tissue tropism, infecting and replicating in multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, coelomocytes, and seam cells. In contrast, previously described microsporidian parasites of C. elegans, such as Nematocida parisii and Nematocida sp. 1, exclusively infect and replicate in the intestine. The life cycle of N. displodere has been characterized, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. The parasite's genome has been sequenced and compared to those of N. parisii and Nematocida sp. 1, revealing that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Notably, over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function, which may mediate interactions with the host. The discovery of N. displodere provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches. This study highlights the complexity of host-microbe interactions and the diversity of tissue tropism exhibited by microsporidian parasites.
The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein plays a crucial role in transcription-coupled DNA repair, a process essential for maintaining genome stability. Mutations in CSB are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. Research has shown that CSB belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, but the extent of its chromatin remodeling activity and its role in DNA repair was unknown. This study reveals that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and that this activity is significantly enhanced by NAP1-like histone chaperones, which are identified as new CSB-binding partners. The study demonstrates that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and NAP1-like chaperones is necessary for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. Furthermore, the study shows that chromatin remodeling and repair protein recruitment mediated by CSB are separable activities. The findings of this study provide new insights into the functions of chromatin remodeling by CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair and the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome. The study also highlights the collaboration between CSB and NAP1-like histone chaperones, adding a new dimension to our understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones regulate chromatin structure.
A recent study has generated a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying clusters of CpG sites with high inter-individual variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs). VMRs were found to occur preferentially at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in five purified cell types. While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset shows highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks with low heritability that differ between cell types and are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs was identified, enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs was found, comprising all four HOX gene clusters and enriched for control of tissue growth. In neurons, a network of 18 VMRs was identified, enriched for roles in synaptic signaling. The study also demonstrated that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans dependent on cellular growth. Notably, environmentally-responsive VMRs showed a strong enrichment for imprinted loci, suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive map of common epigenetic variation in the human genome, highlighting the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping epigenetic variation.
The diagnostic sensitivity of dengue rapid test assays can be significantly enhanced by using a combined antigen and antibody testing approach. A study evaluated the performance of a newly developed Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test. The test was evaluated in a retrospective study in Vietnam with 198 acute laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples, and in Malaysia with 263 laboratory-confirmed positive and 30 negative samples. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the test in Vietnam were 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8% to 75.6%) and 96% (95% CI: 92.2% to 99.8%), respectively. In Malaysia, the performance was similar, with 68.9% sensitivity (95% CI: 61.8% to 76.1%) and 96.7% specificity (95% CI: 82.8% to 99.9%). When the Dengue Early Rapid test was used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. The study found that using dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extend the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples. The results suggest that the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test is a sensitive and specific rapid test for dengue NS1, and its use in combination with an IgM/IgG rapid test can provide optimal diagnostic sensitivity for acute dengue.
A new computational method, Transat, has been developed to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative structures. Traditional RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not account for features required for in vivo folding. To address this limitation, Transat uses a comparative approach to detect conserved helices of high statistical significance in evolutionarily related RNA genes. The method has been comprehensively evaluated and shown to predict the structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted and alternative configurations. Transat can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provide evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways. The results support the notion that homologous RNA sequences not only assume similar reference RNA structures but also fold similarly in vivo. Unlike existing methods, Transat works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. This approach has the advantage of not being able to predict features as a function of time, but it provides a more accurate representation of RNA folding pathways in vivo. The predictions made by Transat are expected to enable more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations, providing useful input to the design and interpretation of future experiments.
The highly buffered Arabidopsis immune signaling network conceals the functions of its components by allowing different parts of the network to compensate for the loss of one another’s functions when targeted and disabled by pathogen effectors. A network reconstitution strategy was employed to resolve systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 ( flg22 ). This approach involved disassembling and stepwise reassembling the plant immune network that mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity ( PTI ). The results show widespread evidence of interactions among major sub-networks, known as sectors, in the flg22-responsive transcriptome. These interactions result in network buffering, which conceals the identity of network components. The regulatory mechanisms resolved by this approach reveal unexpected patterns for how the jasmonate ( JA ), ethylene ( ET ), phytoalexin-deficient 4 ( PAD4 ), and salicylate ( SA ) signaling sectors control the transcriptional response to flg22. The study demonstrates that many of these regulatory mechanisms are not detectable by traditional genetic approaches, such as single-gene null-mutant analysis. Similar to potential pathogenic perturbations, null-mutant effects on immune signaling can be buffered by the network. The findings highlight the effectiveness of a systems biology approach, network reconstitution, in elucidating the dynamical component functions of the plant immune signaling network. This approach can help decipher the regulation of complex networks, such as the plant immune signaling network, which is highly resilient against perturbations.
The Drosophila optic placode undergoes neuroepithelial patterning to give rise to the larval eye primordium and the optic lobe primordium during embryonic development. A genetic network regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary photoreceptor ( PR ) precursors. The proneural factor Atonal ( Ato ) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless ( Tll ) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision to define PR subtype identity. During embryonic development, the Drosophila optic placode produces both larval eye PRs and optic lobe precursors. The boundary between these two groups of cells is established by the non-overlapping expression patterns of Ato and Tll. The Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways interact with transcriptional regulators to define distinct PR and non-PR domains of the larval eye and optic lobe primordium. Notch signaling is also required for regulating PR cell number and maintaining epithelial cell fate of the optic lobe primordium. Inhibiting Notch signaling leads to a complete transformation of the optic placode to PRs of the larval eye.
Human Beta Defensin 1 (hBD1), a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has been found to exhibit distinct antimicrobial mechanisms depending on its redox state. The reduced form of hBD1 (hBD1red) forms a net-like structure that entraps bacteria, preventing their transmigration, whereas the oxidized form (hBD1ox) does not. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of this net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with hBD1red, but not hBD1ox. A transmigration assay demonstrated that hBD1-derived nets capture bacteria and inhibit their migration, independent of bacterial killing. This mechanism is distinct from that of other defensins, such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 (HD6), which requires cysteines for net formation. In contrast, cysteines are necessary for net formation by hBD1red. The presence of these nets can completely prevent the migration of hBD1-resistant pathogens and are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with high amounts of proteases. The redox-dependent function of hBD1 serves as an additional mechanism of action, providing host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures and preventing bacterial invasion. This study highlights the multifunctional activities of hBD1, including distinct antimicrobial mechanisms from a single peptide, and provides new insights into the modes of action of endogenous host defense molecules.
The Lowe syndrome protein OCRL1 plays a crucial role in endocytosis in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. A deficiency in OCRL1 results in impaired endocytosis, characterized by reduced apical uptake of fluid phase markers and low molecular weight proteins from the glomerular filtrate. This defect is associated with reduced abundance of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. Furthermore, the levels of the scavenger receptor megalin are decreased in OCRL1-deficient embryos, which is consistent with reduced recycling within the endocytic pathway. Cell polarity within the pronephric tubule remains unaffected in mutant embryos. The catalytic activity of OCRL1 is required for renal tubular endocytosis, and suppression of PIP5K rescues the endocytic defect in OCRL1-deficient embryos. This indicates that PIP5K is a potential therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. These findings provide the first evidence that OCRL1 regulates endocytic trafficking in vivo and support the hypothesis that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. The results also reveal a critical role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in endocytic trafficking in the renal tubule.
A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in the Kilombero river valley in southern Tanzania to investigate the presence and determinants of inter-epidemic Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission in livestock. The study aimed to establish baseline information on exposure status to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock during the inter-epidemic period and assess the relationship between RVF seropositivity, animal characteristics, and environmental factors. A total of 1680 cattle, sheep, and goats were randomly selected and tested for RVFV antibodies using two commercial ELISA kits. The overall seroprevalence was 11.3%, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during the outbreak. A linear increase in prevalence was observed in post-epidemic annual cohorts, indicating a constant exposure and presence of active foci of recent transmission. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots, and animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km away. The study found no association between RVF seropositivity and species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices, or altitude. The findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area, highlighting the need for active serological surveillance to detect inter-epidemic transmissions.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, utilizes a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate its osmolarity, despite being an obligate intracellular pathogen. The CVC is also involved in the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane, which is essential for host invasion. Rab11, a small GTPase, localizes to the CVC and plays a crucial role in this process. A dominant-negative mutant of TcRab11 (GFP-TcRab11DN) localized to the cytosol, and epimastigotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposmotic and hyperosmotic stress. However, they were still able to differentiate into metacyclic forms and infect host cells. GPI-anchored trans-sialidase (TcTS), mucins of the 60–200 KDa family, and trypomastigote small surface antigen (TcTSSA II) co-localized with GFP-TcRab11 to the CVC during transformation of intracellular amastigotes into trypomastigotes. Parasites expressing GFP-TcRab11DN prevented TcTS from reaching the plasma membrane, and were less infective compared to wild-type cells. Exogenous recombinant active TcTS and a sialic acid donor partially rescued the infectivity of trypomastigotes. These results reveal the roles of TcRab11 in osmoregulation and trafficking of trans-sialidase to the plasma membrane, and a novel unconventional mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion in T. cruzi.
A phase III clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen compared to the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen. The study enrolled 443 healthy individuals aged 1 year and above, who were randomized into four groups to receive intradermal PCECV with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration. The primary objective was to assess the non-inferiority of the 4-site/1-week regimen to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL at day 49. The results showed that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen, with a difference in percentage of participants with adequate RVNA concentrations of -1% (95% CI: -2.4-0.0) at day 49. RVNA geometric mean concentrations were 18 IU/mL in the 4-site/1-week groups and 12 IU/mL in the 2-site/TRC groups at day 14, and subsequently declined in all groups. The 2 regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported. The study suggests that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, offering potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
The study investigated the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the salience network (SN) in the human brain using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project and novel graph-theoretical techniques. The SN, anchored in the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, plays a crucial role in detecting goal-relevant events and facilitating access to cognitive resources. The study found that the SN demonstrated high levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, including the frontoparietal network (FPN), cingulate-opercular network (CON), and ventral and dorsal attention networks (VAN and DAN). The dynamic functional interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain, and SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions. The time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems, and temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were also observed in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of the results. The study provides new insights into the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN and its role in facilitating interactions with multiple functional systems, supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
The SV40 late protein VP4 has been identified as a viroporin that plays a crucial role in the release of the nonenveloped virus SV40 from host cells. The protein is expressed at late times during the viral life cycle, corresponding to the time of cell lysis. To investigate the function of VP4, water-soluble VP4 was expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein from bacteria. Purified VP4 was found to efficiently bind and disrupt biological membranes, forming pores of approximately 3 nm in diameter. The central hydrophobic domain of VP4 was essential for membrane binding and disruption, and the protein displayed a preference for membranes composed of lipids that replicate the composition of plasma membranes over nuclear membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found in bacterial membranes, inhibited the membrane perforation activity of VP4. The disruption of membranes by VP4 involved the formation of pores in mammalian cells, including permissive SV40 host cells. These results support a central role of VP4 in the perforation of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release. The study provides new insights into the poorly understood process of nonenveloped viral release and highlights the importance of VP4 in the life cycle of SV40. The findings suggest that VP4 acts as a viroporin, directly disrupting cellular membranes to facilitate the release of viral particles.
A DNA vaccine based on the NS1 antigen (pcTPANS1) has been shown to induce protection against dengue virus (DENV) in mice. The vaccine, which contains the signal peptide sequence from human tissue plasminogen activator fused to the DENV2 NS1 gene, elicits both cellular and humoral immune responses. The study aimed to elucidate the contribution of these responses to protective immunity against DENV. Results showed that pcTPANS1 induces considerable levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses, including activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies conferred partial protection in mice infected with low virus load, but this protection was abrogated with increased viral dose. Depletion of CD4+ cells in immunized mice completely abolished protection. Transfer experiments revealed that animals receiving CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum, both obtained from vaccinated mice, survived virus infection with survival rates not significantly different from pcTPANS1-immunized animals. These findings suggest that the protective immune response induced by the expression of NS1 antigen mediated by pcTPANS1 requires cooperation between CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity. The study provides new insights into the immunity elicited by DENV NS1 antigen and offers a prospect for vaccine development against dengue.
The ComRS system is a cell-to-cell communication system in Gram-positive bacteria that plays a crucial role in regulating competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. The system consists of the transcription factor ComR, which is activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus, combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays, reveals that XIP-binding induces the release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization, allowing DNA binding. This activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but rather a new member of the RNPP family. The identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation provides a crucial step towards the design of antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci. The ComR regulon includes the comS and comX genes, which are essential for competence in streptococci. This study provides a detailed molecular mechanism of the ComR activation process and offers opportunities to engineer well-controlled peptide-based expression systems in streptococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. The ComRS system is distinct from the two-component signaling system ComDE, which regulates competence in Streptococcus pneumoniae via σX in response to the extracellular Competence-Stimulating-Peptide (CSP).
The prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC has been functionally characterized by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at high micro- to millimolar concentrations. These ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. ELIC forms cation-selective channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single-channel conductance and simple functional behavior of ELIC make it an attractive model system for studying general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors. A library of molecules was screened to identify agonists of ELIC, and a bound ligand was located in a crystal structure. The functional properties of the channel were characterized by electrophysiology, revealing that ELIC is activated by a range of primary amines, including alkylamines, aminothiols, aminoalcohols, bromoamines, diamines, and GABA. ELIC is a cation-selective channel that is impermeable to anions, and its ion conduction properties are closely related to those of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and GLIC. The crystal structure of ELIC, obtained in the absence of ligands, is thought to represent a non-conducting conformation of the channel, but its relationship to the resting or desensitized state of the channel is still unclear.
The study investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, a phenomenon known as the "atopic march." Researchers found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like skin inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, was identified as the systemic driver of bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j, which sustained high systemic levels of TSLP, developed a severe asthmatic phenotype upon antigen-induced allergic challenge. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels were required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Furthermore, outbred K14-TSLPtg mice, which maintained high systemic levels of TSLP without developing skin pathology, were found to be sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization. These findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients. The study also showed that TSLP overexpression in mouse skin led to an AD-like pathology and that TSLP was necessary to predispose RBP-j-deficient animals to the asthmatic phenotype. Concomitant removal of the IL7Rα subunit of the TSLP receptor in RBP-jCKO mice prevented the atopic march despite persistent AD-like pathology and elevated serum IgE levels.
The genome of Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, was analyzed using a multi-omics approach that integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with bioinformatics tools. This analysis revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome compared to other bacteria. The genome has a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), a low number of putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). The promoters and ribosome binding sites in T. maritima show increased sequence conservation compared to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) have an atypical bimodal length distribution, consisting of "Short" 5'UTRs (11-17 nt) and "Common" 5'UTRs (26-32 nt). Transcriptional regulation in T. maritima is limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of transcription units. Furthermore, a high fraction of annotated genes are expressed independently of growth state, and there is a linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance (Pearson r = 0.63, p < 2.2 × 10^(-16) t-test). These properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of T. maritima's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and may provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on Earth. The multi-omics approach used in this study is applicable to many microbial species and can facilitate quantitative and comparative analysis of annotated features across microbial species.
The study investigated how visual context influences the perception of a target bar in a display. Human observers were shown a briefly presented stimulus and asked to judge whether a target bar was present at the center of the display. The target bar had a known orientation and shape, but its contrast was either weak or missing at the target location. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context could perceptually group well with the target, weak contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without context, as if filling in the target. In contrast, high-contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive no target, regardless of whether they grouped well with the target. A Bayesian model of visual inference was used to account for the data, illustrating that context influences perception in two ways: biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The model suggests that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast, but rather the bias to perceive the target's presence. This implies that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for visual inferences. The study also found that the filling-in bias is stronger when the contextual bars have weaker contrasts and when the target is seen as more likely to group with the context as a straight line.
Biologists have long been puzzled by the prevalence of cooperation in nature, particularly in the production of costly common goods, as it is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who consume the common good without contributing fairly. However, a recent study suggests that defectors can actually create conditions that rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction. The researchers used an individual-based approach to model stochastic birth, death, migration, and mutation events in a structured population. They found three mechanisms through which defectors can lead to the rescue of cooperation. First, during defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperator-only populations to grow. Second, defectors cause population extinction, creating empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants, leading to the survival of cooperators. Third, resource limitation, precipitated by defectors, selects for rare mutants adapted to this limitation, further reducing local population size and favoring cooperation. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators compared to when defectors are initially absent. The study predicts that in a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant challenge to the mucosal barrier. In patients with compromised epithelial barriers, infections can develop. Research has shown that P. aeruginosa adheres almost exclusively to multi-cellular junctions in a polarized epithelium, where it binds to extruded apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies. This dead cell tropism is independent of the type of cell death, as P. aeruginosa also binds to necrotic cells. The bacteria are then internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, P. aeruginosa inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is ultimately killed. The study proposes that elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis is a host defense mechanism. The findings have implications for the study of cystic fibrosis, a condition characterized by an increased number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis. The research highlights the ability of epithelial cells to eliminate P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis, suggesting that this process may be part of a host defense mechanism against this opportunistic pathogen.
During Drosophila embryonic development, the assembly of the gonad involves the migration of Primordial Germ Cells ( PGCs ) to the Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells ( SGPs ). The PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm to reach the SGPs, guided by local repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. The hedgehog ( hh ) pathway gene shifted ( shf ) plays a crucial role in directing PGC migration by facilitating the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PGC migration, as demonstrated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway generates the PGC attractant produced by the SGPs and other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. The production of this attractant depends on shf and another hh pathway gene, gγ1. Ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release and transmission of Hh ligand from these cells into the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. The potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification. These findings suggest that shf and the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway work together to orchestrate PGC migration during Drosophila embryonic development.
A recent study investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in individuals vaccinated with a replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine. The study aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying protection from HIV infection or immune control over HIV replication. The researchers measured granzyme B target cell activity and HIV-1-infected CD4+ T-cell elimination in vaccine recipients, HIV-negative individuals, and chronically infected patients, including long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). The results showed that HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses were readily detectable in vaccinees at a median of 331 days following the last immunization. However, the magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations or the percentages of cytokine-secreting T-cells. Notably, vaccine recipients carrying the HLA class I alleles B*27, B*57, or B*58, associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection, exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic responses. These findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity and highlights the importance of HLA class I alleles in vaccine-induced immune responses.
The article presents a formal model of the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, demonstrating that the emergence of shared intentions is closely linked to the advancement of technology and culture. The shared intentionality hypothesis suggests that the evolution of modern human cognition was facilitated by the development of collaborative behavior among early hominins. This is supported by evidence that the emergence of shared intentions coincided with significant technological advancements, such as the evolution of composite tool manufacture and grammatical language. The authors propose that the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is a key factor in the rapid advancement of technology and culture. In their model, individuals with the ability to share intentions (SI type individuals) can adjust their strategies in tandem with their neighbors to mutual benefit. The results show that jointly intentional behavior leads to faster convergence to improved technological norms. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. This model provides a unified explanation for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior. The findings suggest that an environment rich in coordination problems is conducive to the emergence of jointly intentional behavior.
The loss of miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci in mice results in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, aberrant sperm morphology, and impaired motility. This condition is the leading cause of human sub/infertility. The miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci are specifically and highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and are critical for spermatogenesis. Deletion of these loci impairs both meiosis and the final stages of spermatozoa maturation. Analysis of miR-34bc−/−;449−/− pachytene spermatocytes reveals a small cohort of deregulated genes that are highly enriched for miR-34 family target genes. The loss of miR-34bc/449 does not block spermatogenesis but impairs several developmental transitions, resulting in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Histological analysis of miR-34bc−/−;449−/− mice shows a thinning of the epithelium within the seminiferous tubules and a drop in the quantity and quality of mature sperm. The motility of miR-34bc−/−;449−/− sperm is severely affected, and the sperm are of aberrant morphology. This study identifies the miR-34 family as the first functionally important miRNAs for spermatogenesis whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility. The findings suggest that the miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci have multiple functions during spermatogenesis, regulating both meiosis and the later stages of spermiogenesis.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain unclear. EcN produces two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) responsible for an antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae, as well as the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a putative pro-carcinogenic compound. To decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity, researchers investigated the role of the pks-encoded ClbP, the peptidase that activates colibactin. They found that ClbP is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN and that the transmembrane helices of ClbP, not the periplasmic peptidase domain, are involved in this activity. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivated the genotoxic activity but maintained the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced the clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild-type strain. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. The interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic pathogen responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, relies on glycans for survival in the host and pathogenesis. Nucleotide sugar transporters ( NSTs ) mediate the exchange of activated sugars for nucleoside monophosphates, a critical step in glycan biosynthesis. The major virulence factor of C. neoformans is its polysaccharide capsule, composed of glucuronoxylomannan ( GXM ) and glucuronoxylomannanogalactan ( GXMGal ), which acts as a physical barrier against host defenses and an immune modulator. Xylose, a neutral monosaccharide, is a significant component of the capsule. Two transporters, Uxt1 and Uxt2, have been identified as specific for the xylose donor, UDP-xylose, and are required for xylose incorporation into the capsule and proteins. These transporters are also necessary for C. neoformans to cause disease in mice, although not for fungal viability in the context of infection. The study provides insights into the substrate specificity of NSTs and a synthetic pathway that may be targeted for therapy, contributing to our understanding of fundamental glycobiology. The findings have implications for deciphering the mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response.
The development of an open-access global database for mapping, control, and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is crucial for targeting control interventions, monitoring, and evaluation. Currently, there is a lack of a georeferenced global database providing open-access to available survey data for NTDs. To address this gap, a database was developed to store location-specific prevalence data and survey details for NTDs, with an initial focus on schistosomiasis in Africa. The database was created by systematically searching the literature, contacting Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries, and extracting, georeferencing, and storing the data in a MySQL database with a web interface. At the beginning of 2011, the database contained over 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries. The database is now expanded to a global repository, including other NTDs such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis. The open-access, spatially explicit NTD database offers opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance, as well as detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time. The development of this database demonstrates the feasibility of establishing and running a global NTD database, which should be expanded without delay. The database is available at http://www.gntd.org.
This study investigated whether chronic helminth infection exacerbates Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis. The researchers hypothesized that chronic helminth infections, which induce a Th2 immune shift and immunoregulatory milieu, would suppress Th1 immunity necessary for controlling MTB infection. However, the study found that chronic L. sigmodontis infection did not exacerbate MTB infection in cotton rats. Immunological responses, histological studies, and quantitative mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MTB challenge in cotton rats with and without chronic L. sigmodontis infection. The results showed that spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified protein derivative were similar between co-infected and MTB-only infected animals. Furthermore, MTB loads and the occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals compared to those infected with only MTB. These findings suggest that chronic filaria infections do not worsen MTB infection in the cotton rat model. The study's results indicate that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control, but also suggest that worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases may not substantially increase the risk for infections.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel ( DEG/ENaC ) family represents one of the largest families of ion channels, yet the physiological functions of these proteins remain poorly understood. This study investigated the role of ppk23, a member of the DEG/ENaC family, in chemosensory functions and courtship behavior in Drosophila. The results show that ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those involved in feeding-related gustatory responses. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses, but instead delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship behavior. Furthermore, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7, 11 ( Z ), 11 ( Z ) -Heptacosadiene. These findings indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. The study suggests that ppk23 is a potential candidate for a pheromone receptor or a key component of the pheromonal signaling cascade. The results also indicate that DEG/ENaC signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors and reveal a novel physiological function for this important family of ion channels.
Mitochondrial tRNA import plays a crucial role in ensuring proper mitochondrial translation across diverse phyla, including protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and humans. However, the regulation of this process remains poorly understood. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, a correlation was found between mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be a dynamic process adapting to the mitochondrial genome content. To investigate this, the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome was manipulated by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage. The results showed that codon usage modification led to reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and decreased levels and activities of respiratory complexes. These effects were linked to limitations in the pool of tRNAs in mitochondria, indicating that tRNA mitochondrial import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context. Instead, the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria appear to result from a co-evolutionary adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The study suggests that the information residing in the mitochondrial DNA defines the levels of imported tRNAs, allowing for optimal mitochondrial translation. These findings have implications for understanding the regulation of mitochondrial translation and the co-evolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.
Biomedical research has revealed new patterns of glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes through the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation rely on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. This study employed CGM to evaluate postprandial glucose elevations, types of patterns, and variability between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance and secretion highlighted the highly variable physiology underlying dysglycemia between individuals. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, called "glucotypes," which revealed heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. The study found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. Glucose dysregulation, as characterized by CGM, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures. The interindividual variability in glycemic responses to standardized meals highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation. A model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and a webtool for visualizing and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes were developed. The study suggests that an increase in glucose variability might precede the currently used measures defining abnormal glucose levels, representing an earlier stage of "prediabetes."
The Raf-like mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) EDR1 has been identified as a negative regulator of plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis. However, the mechanisms by which EDR1 functions and its relationship to MAP kinase cascades have remained unclear. This study reveals that EDR1 physically interacts with the MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK5, and negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade. The interaction between EDR1 and MKK4/MKK5 requires the N-terminal domain of EDR1, and EDR1 also negatively affects the protein levels of MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6. Furthermore, the study shows that edr1 mutants have highly activated MPK3/MPK6 kinase activity and higher levels of MPK3/MPK6 proteins than wild-type plants. The results also indicate that MKK4 and MKK5 are key players in plant immunity responses, as mkk4 and mkk5 loss-of-function mutants display enhanced susceptibility to powdery mildew and edr1-mediated resistance requires MKK4 and MKK5 function. Over-expression of MKK4 or MKK5 causes edr1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death, suggesting that the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade plays a crucial role in fine-tuning plant innate immunity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of plant defense and cell death, and highlight the importance of EDR1 and the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in regulating plant innate immunity.
The article presents a computational framework based on Gaussian processes for spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. The framework is designed to identify highly nonlinear dependencies and make reliable predictions. It combines spatial and temporal similarity matrices to obtain a larger similarity matrix between location and time period pairs. A Gaussian process regression model is then trained using the combined similarity matrix and reported cases counts to make predictions under three different scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed framework is tested on Turkey’s country-wide surveillance data set of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, a vector-borne infectious disease with a high case fatality rate. The results show that the Gaussian process formulation outperforms two standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted regression trees, under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. The framework has the potential to contribute to public health policy making by providing reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of Gaussian processes in capturing complex dependencies and making accurate predictions, making it a valuable approach for infectious disease modeling.
The article presents a mathematical model to investigate the transmission dynamics of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) among ruminants in Northeastern Africa and the Middle East. The model takes into account the effects of seasonality and socioeconomic factors, such as the Eid al Adha feast, on the transmission and dispersal of the disease. The results indicate that human activities associated with the festival, combined with climatic factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to the spread of the disease. The model also shows that sporadic outbreaks may occur when abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the festival and when abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge. The numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. The study also investigates the impact of festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, animal transportation speed, and death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices, on the patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch. The results suggest that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in the patch where the religious ceremony will be held. The model can be used to predict the disease outbreaks and provide information to local governments on how to effectively control the transmission of the disease pathogen.
Between 1984 and 2010, the incidence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan underwent significant spatial and temporal changes. Initially, the disease showed an increasing trend during the Soviet governance era, peaking in the mid-1990s with an annual percent change of +11.95%. Following the initiation of a preemptive livestock vaccination program in 1996, the incidence of human anthrax began to decline at a rate of -35.24%. The geographic distribution of the disease also shifted eastward over time, with cases initially concentrated in the west and south during the Soviet era, followed by a shift towards the capital city of Baku in the mid-1990s. During the preemptive vaccination period, the disease remained primarily concentrated in eastern and northern Azerbaijan. The study's findings highlight the need for continued control measures in livestock to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax. The shifting patterns of the disease also underscore the importance of an integrated "One Health" approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease. The study's results are consistent with previous research documenting changes in the occurrence of zoonotic diseases following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The re-emergence of anthrax in the Caucasus region raises concerns over the potential trans-boundary spread of the disease.
The molecular basis of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) interactions with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel has been investigated using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which PUFAs modulate the channel's voltage-sensitivity, which can provide effective treatment against refractory epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. The simulations revealed a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel, located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). The lipophilic PUFA tail exhibited non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group displayed specific interactions with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices, encompassing the S3-S4 linker. In contrast, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) showed increased conformational flexibility in their polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains, which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of PUFA interactions with the Shaker KV channel, shedding light on the potential therapeutic applications of PUFAs in treating refractory epilepsy.
Scientists have developed a screening pipeline to identify antiparasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parvum inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite responsible for significant disease burden in children in developing countries and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current treatments are ineffective, and the parasite's experimental tractability has hindered the discovery of novel therapeutics. The researchers genetically engineered Toxoplasma gondii, a related parasite, to serve as a model for C. parvum infection, allowing for a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and target specificity. A fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay utilizing automated high-content imaging analysis were also developed to further evaluate compounds. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors and identified a subset of 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent in vivo selectivity in the T. gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. Two promising candidates, A103 and A110, were identified, which are >100× more potent than the current standard for anticryptosporidial activity, paromomycin. The screening pipeline provides a valuable tool for the discovery of novel antiparasitic agents targeting C. parvum IMPDH.
A genome-wide association study was conducted to identify genetic loci associated with primary tooth development during infancy. The study analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Five loci were identified at a significance level of P<5×10−8, and five additional loci showed suggestive association at P<5×10−6. The identified loci included genes linked to tooth and other organ development, such as KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. These genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and some have been implicated in cancer. Mutations in three of these genes, KCNJ2, EDA, and IGF2BP1, have been associated with altered organogenesis and development in other systems. The study also found that a variant within the HOXB gene cluster was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years. The findings suggest that genetic determinants of early tooth eruption may influence dental occlusion later in life. The study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and has implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes.
The trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) causes Down syndrome (DS), a condition characterized by intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. In contrast, complete monosomy of Hsa21 is lethal, and only partial monosomy or mosaic monosomy is seen. To identify dosage-sensitive genes involved in DS and monosomy 21 phenotypes, researchers created two new mouse models: Ts3Yah, carrying a tandem duplication, and Ms3Yah, carrying a deletion of the Hspa13-App interval syntenic with 21q11.2-q21.3. The study found that trisomy and monosomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance. Gene expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed global changes in the regulation of genes implicated in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. These genes were downregulated in Ts3Yah mice and upregulated in Ms3Yah mice. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlated with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in respiratory function. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased. The study suggests that the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of changes in the dose of Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. The results indicate that copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
A quantitative model of the G protein-gated K+ channel (GIRK1/2) has been developed to elucidate the mechanisms of its basal and evoked activities. The model accurately recapitulates GIRK1/2 currents in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons, and correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ. The model reveals that between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while available Gαi/o decreases from ~2 to less than one Gα per channel as GIRK1/2 density increases. The persistent Gβγ/channel ratio suggests a strong association of GIRK1/2 with Gβγ, but not Gα, consistent with recruitment to the cell surface of Gβγ, but not Gα, by GIRK1/2. The analysis suggests a maximal stoichiometry of 4 Gβγ but only 2 Gαi/o per one GIRK1/2 channel. The unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits and the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by Gβγ underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities, allowing GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα. The model fully accounts for the inverse correlation between basal (Ibasal) and agonist activation index (Ra) previously observed in heterologous systems and in hippocampal neurons.
A novel computational model called PrediTALE has been developed to predict the target genes of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) in plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. TALEs are secreted into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators to support bacterial virulence. The model accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. PrediTALE is trained on quantitative data and can account for dependencies between adjacent repeat-variable diresidues (RVD) positions. The model is benchmarked using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice and shows an overall improvement in prediction performance compared to previous approaches. Genome-wide predictions using PrediTALE enable the identification of novel targets independently of existing gene annotations, including previously missing non-coding RNAs. The model predicts several unique target genes, some of which are highly promising for further experimental validation. The results demonstrate that accurate computational predictions of TALE target boxes are required for elucidating virulence targets of TALEs that support bacterial infection of host plants. Genome-wide scans for putative target boxes using PrediTALE can recover known targets from promoterome-wide scans and detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.
Title: High-confidence assessment of functional impact of human mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations by APOGEE

    APOGEE is a machine-learning algorithm designed to predict the pathogenicity of human mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations with high confidence. Mitochondrial DNA contains 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the pathogenicity of the majority has been assessed in-silico using software predictors. However, these tools have been found to be incongruent. To address this issue, APOGEE was developed to outperform existing prediction methods.

    The APOGEE algorithm was built on a training set of 864 known mitochondrial variants, with 100 sets of variants drawn randomly and with replacement. Performance metrics were calculated on out-of-bag test sets, as well as for individual predictors. The frequency of coevolving amino acids and mean MI Z-score for each amino acid site were computed for all 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes and made available through MitImpact. Variants were grouped into training and test sets to build and verify the APOGEE classifier.

    APOGEE's operating logic is based on the classification model of the Logistic Model Tree (LMT), which feeds third-party predictors with features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, such as multi-alignments and amino acid conservation estimates. The reasoning strategy was tuned on finely curated, non-overlapping, training sets of variations, and the predicting model was based on decision tree learning to provide investigable rules of pathogenicity. This approach aims to provide a high-confidence assessment of the functional impact of human mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations.
Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. A recent study has demonstrated that DENV NS1 can activate platelets via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. The study found that DENV supernatant, but not Zika virus supernatant, induced P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV also induced platelet activation, which was blocked by anti-NS1 F(ab')2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist, and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. The activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Furthermore, DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. These results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection. The study highlights the central role of DENV NS1 in the complex interplay of dengue pathogenesis, including thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and cytokine storm.
The article presents a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops regulating vasomotor tone, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure in the body. The analysis focuses on the interactions between the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide system (ANP), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The study reveals the presence of two regulatory mechanisms that perform the same qualitative function: one affects blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction, and the other affects blood volume. Both mechanisms are candidate oscillators consisting of a negative-feedback loop of a monotone system, which can exhibit stable or oscillatory instability. A subsystem, including ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, is also identified as a candidate oscillator composed of a monotone system with multiple negative feedback loops. The study shows that the oscillatory potential of this subsystem is higher when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable. The results provide insight into the physiological mechanisms governing long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters, which operate based on dynamical loops of interactions. The analysis suggests that the physiological mechanisms regulating blood pressure and volume are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The study highlights the loop arrangement and its dynamic function in the AVP-ANP-RAAS endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure.
Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A novel mechanism regulating thrombus growth has been identified, related to the formation of a fibrin cap. The study investigated protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus, by integrating experiments with model simulations. The results showed that network permeability and protein diffusivity are crucial factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus is washed downstream through the fibrin network, limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. The fibrin cap also restricts the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, impairing platelet activation and limiting thrombus growth. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events. The study highlights the importance of spatial distributions of hemostatic activators, such as thrombin, in regulating thrombogenesis. The findings suggest that the fibrin network overlaying a thrombus limits thrombus growth by affecting protein transport and separating resting platelets from regions of high thrombin concentration. Overall, the study provides justification for a previously unrecognized mechanism limiting growth of small asymptomatic thrombi.
Invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells play a crucial role in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) replication during infection. However, the mechanisms by which iNKT cells exert their antimicrobial activity are not fully understood. This study investigated the role of iNKT cells in limiting Mtb growth in co-culture with infected macrophages. The results showed that iNKT cell activation, as measured by CD25 upregulation and IFNγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. In contrast, iNKT cell control of Mtb growth was found to be CD1d-dependent and independent of IL-12, IL-18, and IFNγ. Furthermore, iNKT cell control of Mtb replication was also independent of TNF and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Instead, the study identified granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) as a novel mediator of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity. iNKT cells produced GM-CSF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1d-dependent manner during Mtb infection, and GM-CSF was found to be both necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. These findings suggest that GM-CSF production is a key effector function of iNKT cells in controlling Mtb infection, and highlight the importance of CD1d-dependent TCR-mediated signaling in iNKT cell antimicrobial activity.
The study investigated the self-regulation of Candida albicans population size during gastrointestinal (GI) colonization. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is a common component of human intestinal flora. Genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied to gain insight into C. albicans colonization. The EFH1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was found to be highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. Unexpectedly, an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, whereas an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and oral cavity of athymic mice. When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice, both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, other mutants were attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. The results suggest that expression of EFH1 regulates the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Furthermore, different genes are required in different host niches, and the pathways that regulate gene expression during host colonization can differ from those used during laboratory growth. The study highlights the importance of EFH1 in determining the population size of C. albicans during colonization and its potential role in reducing the likelihood of C. albicans infection.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is a highly effective strategy against liver stages of the malaria parasite, but the mechanisms behind this approach are not fully understood. A recent study investigated the role of prolonged antigen presentation in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses against malaria liver stages. The study used TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporozoite protein, a leading vaccine candidate, and found that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization. This persistence was detected in lymphoid organs and was dependent on the presence of CD11c+ cells. The study showed that prolonged antigen presentation enhanced the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naïve animals. Finally, persisting antigen was able to prime naïve cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. These findings suggest that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent on the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of irradiated sporozoite immunization and highlights the importance of antigen persistence in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses.
Biodegradable nanocarriers coated with polymyxin B (PBCAnp-polB) were evaluated for their leishmanicidal and antibacterial potential. PBCAnp-polB were fabricated by anionic polymerization and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, and vertical diffusion cell. The nanoparticles had a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm, low polydispersity index, and a ζ potential of 1.79 ± 0.17 mV, which remained stable for at least 45 days. The 50% drug release from PBCAnp-polB was 6-7 times slower than free polymyxin B, indicating a prolonged release profile. In vitro evaluations showed that polymyxin B alone reduced Leishmania amazonensis amastigote infection of macrophages at 10 μg/mL, but complete parasite elimination was not achieved, even at higher concentrations. In contrast, PBCAnp-polB demonstrated leishmanicidal activity and surpassed polymyxin B activity, with an IC50 value of 6.0 μg/mL. Additionally, PBCAnp-polB showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella, while polymyxin B maintained its activity against these bacteria. The results suggest that PBCAnp-polB is a promising antileishmanial and antimicrobial drug delivery system, particularly for the prevention and treatment of secondary infections associated with cutaneous Leishmania amazonensis lesions.
A historical cohort study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil to investigate prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study analyzed data from the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) for the period 2002-2009. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with death from VL. Two models were developed: Model 1 (2002-2009) included variables present in both SINAN versions, and Model 2 (2007-2009) included additional variables from the Net version. In Model 1, weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years were significantly associated with a greater risk of death from VL. In Model 2, bleeding, other associated infections, jaundice, and age ≥60 years were associated with an increased likelihood of death from VL. A prognostic score was developed using the variables from Model 2, which showed a predictive performance of 71.4% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity, 28.9% positive predictive value, 94.5% negative predictive value, and 75.6% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The study found that the factors associated with death from VL were weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, other associated infections, bleeding, jaundice, and age ≥60 years. These findings are in agreement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which considers age <6 months or >65 years, jaundice, bleeding, and co-morbidities, including bacterial infections, as factors associated with death from VL.
The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 plays a crucial role in plant growth, cell death, and innate immunity. A novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5, was found to differentially regulate three BAK1-dependent signaling pathways. The bak1-5 mutant was severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent receptor kinases FLS2 and EFR, but not in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling or cell death control. In contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, kinase activity is dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 requires BAK1-5 kinase activity. The results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by BAK1. The study reveals key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD receptor kinases. The importance of the heteromerization with BAK1 in plant innate immunity is substantiated by the targeting of the ligand-induced BAK1-FLS2 interaction by the bacterial virulence effector AvrPto to block PTI signaling. The function of BAK1 in cell death control and innate immunity appears to be independent of its function in BR signaling.
The article presents a novel approach to modeling the response of cancer cells to anticancer treatments using a combination of experimental and computational methods. Time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data were used to track the cell cycle and subsequent generations of human ovarian cancer cells treated with X-rays. A computational model was developed to render the proliferative process, incorporating modules that describe the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase of the cell cycle. The model was tested with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy, spanning a wide range of X-ray doses. The final model provided a complete in silico rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, offering separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This approach enabled the reconciliation of known effects of ionizing radiations and provided new insights into the response of cancer cells to treatment. The method allows for a detailed study of the mechanisms underlying the response to anticancer treatment at the cell population level, accounting for inter-cell variability. The model can be used to apply different types of modules in each phase and test models at the complexity level justified by the available data. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer cell biology and inform the development of more effective anticancer therapies.
Primary Coenzyme Q (CoQ) Deficiency in Pdss2 Mutant Mice Causes Isolated Renal Disease
    A study investigated the effects of primary CoQ deficiency in mice with a missense mutation in the Pdss2 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in CoQ biosynthesis. Homozygous mutations in Pdss2 have been associated with severe neuromuscular disease and nephrotic syndrome in humans. The study found that mice with the Pdss2kd/kd genotype exhibited significantly lower levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates compared to control mice. Disease manifestations in these mice originated specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease was observed in Podocin/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6.Alb/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice had undetectable CoQ9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and altered intermediary metabolism, but did not exhibit overt disease. These findings suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency are related to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment. The study demonstrates that renal disease in Pdss2kd/kd mice results from podocyte-specific Pdss2 dysfunction, and that the inflammatory response is not the primary cause of the renal disease. The availability of B6.Pdss2loxP/loxP mice will permit future investigations into the specific sites of CoQ deficiency and tissue damage in other tissues, such as the central nervous system and skeletal muscle.
The article reports that determinative developmental cell lineages in two protostomes and one deuterostome exhibit robustness to cell deaths due to environmental and genetic perturbations. Phenotypic robustness is a key characteristic of life, but its underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins are not well understood. The study demonstrates that cell lineage robustness arises from several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types. These features underlie the robustness of the cell lineages to necrosis and cell division program failure, which represent environmental and genetic disturbances, respectively. The study provides experimentally testable hypotheses on the organizing principles of developmental cell lineages and opens the door to characterizing systemic properties of complex cell lineages. The findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness that manifests at the supracellular level and is a unique feature of multicellular organisms. This mechanism complements subcellular and cellular mechanisms of robustness to form a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic perturbations. The study also provides a novel explanation of the contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robustness and suggests that cell lineage robustness can arise as an adaptation to certain disturbances in ontogenesis. The results have important implications for understanding development, evolution, and carcinogenesis.
The article presents EmbryoPhenomics, an open-source high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) and a Python package Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV). OpenVIM captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled environmental conditions, while EmbryoCV extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, behavioral, and proxy traits during embryonic development. The platform is demonstrated in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistressor responses to environmental change (temperature and salinity) in over 30 million images of over 600 embryos of two species with different patterns of development. The results show that EmbryoCV successfully extracted phenome-level data from 95% of the images, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral embryo responses. EmbryoPhenomics is shown to be capable of acquiring and processing data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages. The platform is versatile and can be applied to a broad range of experimental designs, from 2-week to 24-hour experiments, and can be used to study embryonic development in a manner befitting phenomics. The results demonstrate high concordance between manually and EmbryoCV-determined measures of embryo spatial and temporal characteristics. EmbryoPhenomics has the potential to be game-changing for those interested in studying development and phenomics, particularly in the context of assessing complex organismal responses to environmental change.
Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) undergo significant changes in metabolism as they transition between their complex life cycles in mosquito and human hosts. Using stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics, researchers investigated stage-specific changes in Plasmodium berghei carbon metabolism. The study found that glutamine serves as the primary input into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in both asexual and sexual blood stages, and is essential for complete male gametogenesis. Additionally, glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are crucial for the ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These findings highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species and underscore the importance of integrating metabolomics data with other platforms to inform drug discovery and design. The study also suggests that inhibitors of the TCA cycle, currently being investigated for asexual inhibition of the malaria parasite, may also have transmission-blocking capacity. The results provide new insights into the metabolic flexibility of different Plasmodium mosquito stages and the impact of parasite metabolism on development in the mosquito vector. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of Plasmodium metabolism and identifies potential targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies.
Incoherent feedforward loops ( IFFLs ) are a common motif in biological signaling pathways that enable cells to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in the regulation of downstream gene expression. IFFLs consist of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output, allowing the system to exhibit temporal adaptation and desensitize to sustained inputs. This property enables the system to distinguish between input signals with varying temporal profiles. However, the ability of IFFLs to process oscillatory signals is limited by two constraints. The kinetics of the IFFL components dictate the input range for which the network can decode pulsatile dynamics, and a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal "counting" of oscillatory signals. The authors used quantitative modeling to examine the ability of IFFLs to process oscillatory signals and found that the network's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by these constraints. The study highlights the importance of understanding how cells process oscillatory signals and has implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for this purpose. The IFFL motif is found downstream of divergent signals in both social amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation, suggesting a general role in processing transient or oscillatory signals.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. However, research into its basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity has been hindered by its obligate intracellular nature, requiring specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. To address this, a clinical isolate of O. tsutsugamushi was grown in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast ( L929 ) cells, and bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsutsugamushi-specific qPCR assay. A standardised method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions was developed. The study presents a body of data to support improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this organism, which will be useful for improving clinical isolation rates and performing in vitro cell biology experiments. A simplified growth assay was used to compare the growth of O. tsutsugamushi across a range of conditions, allowing for the quantification of bacterial levels by extracting total DNA and measuring the exact genome copy number using a primer/probe set specific to a short region within the O. tsutsugamushi 47kDa Htra single copy gene. These findings will be useful to researchers working on O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens, such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families.
This study investigated the safety and efficacy of the antihelminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) in children aged 1–5 years, who are currently excluded from schistosome control programs due to a lack of PZQ safety data in this age group. A total of 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1–5 years were treated with PZQ tablets, and side effects were assessed by questionnaire administered to their caregivers within 24 hours of treatment. Treatment efficacy was determined 6 weeks after PZQ administration through schistosome egg counts in urine. The study found that PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in 1–5 year olds, with an egg reduction rate (ERR) of 99% and a cure rate (CR) of 92%. These results were comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in 6–10 year olds, where ERR was 96% and CR was 67%. Only 3.8% of the children reported side effects within 24 hours of taking PZQ treatment, which included stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body. The study suggests that PZQ treatment is as safe and efficacious in children aged 1–5 years as it is in older children aged 6–10 years, where PZQ is the drug of choice for control of schistosome infections. These findings support the inclusion of pre-school children and infants in schistosome-control programs.
A genome-wide functional screen in Drosophila melanogaster was conducted to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. The screen used a Ras85DV12-driven tumorigenesis model and RNAi-mediated knockdown to assay the role of a large number of previously unexplored genes in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis in vivo. This approach allowed for the identification of multiple novel and evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Human gene orthologs of the fly hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors. Of the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosophila assays, including many known cancer genes and multiple novel candidate genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumorigenesis. The top hit, Tetraspanin 29Fb, was mechanistically characterized and found to regulate EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrain tumor growth and invasion. Low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. This study provides a starting point for the identification of novel genes and pathways involved in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers. The findings have implications for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a diverse range of epithelial tumors.
The wtf gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains meiotic drivers that subvert gametogenesis to increase their transmission into progeny. The wtf13 gene, found in lab stocks, is a meiotic driver that generates a diffusible poison and a spore-specific antidote, killing spores that do not inherit it. A suppressor of wtf13, wtf18-2, arose spontaneously in the lab and encodes a protein that acts via molecular mimicry of the wtf13 antidote. Wtf18-2 rescues only the spores that inherit it, selfishly gaining a transmission advantage while dampening the drive of wtf13. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic drive suppressors and provides insight into the mechanisms and evolution of drive systems. Four other wtf genes have been identified as meiotic drivers in wild isolates of S. pombe, all acting to kill spores that do not inherit them. At least one of these genes, wtf4, causes meiotic drive by a poison and antidote mechanism. The wtf18-2 protein does not act indiscriminately to prevent spore destruction, but rather rescues only the spores that inherit it. This is a departure from the prevailing hypothesis that suppressors of killer meiotic drivers work indiscriminately. The results suggest that at least some wtf genes encode only antidotes and can act as suppressors of wtf drive genes.
Biomedical researchers have developed an algorithm to predict gene expression differences among human individuals using only their genotype information. The algorithm uses training expression and genotype data from a set of individuals to predict the expression of genes in unseen test individuals based on their genotype in the local genomic vicinity of the predicted gene. Notably, the predictions are robust and agree well between the training and test sets, even when the training and test sets consist of individuals from distinct populations. The algorithm can predict the expression of a relatively small number of genes, but the robust nature of the predictions means that the identity and quantitative degree to which genes can be predicted is known in advance. An extension of the algorithm incorporates heterogeneous types of genomic annotations to differentially weigh the importance of the various genetic variants. Assigning higher weights to variants with particular annotations such as proximity to genes and high regional G/C content can further improve the predictions. Genes that are successfully predicted have higher expression and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of the types of genes that can be predicted from their cis genetic variation. The algorithm's ability to predict gene expression changes among individuals based on their genetic sequence variation is a major goal in understanding the susceptibility to different diseases and phenotypes.
The study investigated the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent clone of Plasmodium chabaudi (AS) by a virulent clone (AJ) in immuno-deficient and competent mice. Using dynamical-model based Bayesian inference, the researchers tested whether competitive suppression was caused by clone-specific differences in adaptive immune clearance of merozoites and parasitised red blood cells (RBCs), background loss of merozoites and parasitised RBCs, RBC age preference, RBC infection rate, burst size, and within-RBC interference. The results showed that only one parameter, the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature RBCs, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This parameter was found to be the same for both clones in single-clone infections but different between the clones in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, which explains why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. The study found that competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitaemia. The results suggest that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones, and that there may be an interaction between the clones and the innate immune response that induces changes in the strength of its clearance of merozoites.
The Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) model proposes that a replication error at pre-existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. This intermediate subsequently integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. The model was tested using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results show that the proposed replication error, the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create "closed" forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. The removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid. This plasmid integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. The ODIRA model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent. This feature is readily explained by a plasmid intermediate that arises from one homologue and integrates into the other homologue prior to meiosis. The tests of key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest further avenues of enquiry to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted copy number variations pivotal in human health and evolution.
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of translation initiation in cells infected with influenza virus. The authors investigate the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation, where translation can initiate at non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli. Using ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactimidomycin, the authors experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus. They identify several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons downstream of canonical initiation codons. One of these candidate downstream start sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and a portion of the transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminidase protein is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. The authors also perform evolutionary analyses that suggest selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. Overall, the study systematically maps the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and sheds light on the evolutionary forces shaping this landscape.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne disease, resulting in significant economic and health burdens. EHEC can lead to severe bloody diarrhea and potentially fatal kidney disease (hemolytic uremic syndrome) for which there is no effective treatment or prophylaxis. EHEC and other enteric pathogens utilize a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, which subvert host cell function to promote diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. However, the mechanisms by which these effectors bind to host proteins and disrupt normal intestinal epithelial cell function have not been fully characterized. This study investigated the binding of E. coli O157:H7 T3SS effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcriptional complexes. The study found that NleH1 and NleH2 bind to RPS3 in the cytoplasm, but not in cell nuclei, and that the N-terminal region of both proteins is required for binding. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduced the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, while NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription. A region of NleH1 (N40-K45) was identified as responsible for the inhibitory activity of NleH1 toward RPS3. Deleting nleH1 from E. coli O157:H7 produced a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection. The study suggests that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes.
Transcription factor (TF) binding to its DNA target site is a fundamental regulatory interaction. The current dominant model used to represent TF binding specificities is the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which assumes independence between binding positions. However, this simplifying assumption does not hold in many cases. A novel probabilistic method, feature motif models (FMMs), is presented to model TF-DNA interactions based on log-linear models. FMMs use sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature may span multiple positions. The mathematical formulation of the model and an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data are developed. A discriminative motif finder is also devised to discover de novo FMMs that are enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. The approach is evaluated on synthetic data and the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. The algorithm is then applied to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human, revealing sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. The results show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/. FMMs are a generalization of the PSSM model, enabling complex position dependencies to be captured, as well as other high-level features such as palindromes.
The study investigated the regulation of sympathetic nervous activity in humans and chimpanzees by examining the adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) gene. Knockout mice for this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral alterations associated with the fight-or-flight response. The study found that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Using three-dimensional chromatin structure analysis, a cis-regulatory region was identified whose DNA sequences have been accelerated in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each harboring a polymorphism. Genotyping and analysis of population genome data revealed that the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in bonobos or macaques. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays showed that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C, likely by increasing NRSF binding. The study also detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. The findings suggest that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees. The study used a combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and population genomic data to identify selected regulatory variants responsible for human- and chimpanzee-specific repression of ADRA2C. The results indicate that the repression of ADRA2C is mediated by different mechanisms in humans and chimpanzees, with humans exhibiting DNA methylation and chimpanzees showing H3K27me3 marks.
The C4 photosynthetic pathway is a highly complex trait that has evolved independently in at least 60 species across monocotyledons and dicotyledons, resulting in a 50% increase in productivity in tropical and subtropical areas. To investigate the genetic networks underlying this trait, a new informatics framework was developed to enable deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. This framework was applied to two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, whose last common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago. A cohort of 3,335 genes representing conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development was identified, and genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle were found to be recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Notably, homologous transcription factors were used to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain cell-specific gene expression in both species, despite their wide evolutionary separation. A core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation was also identified, which is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of monocotyledons and dicotyledons. These findings suggest that parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis, and that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insights into the molecular convergence of complex phenotypes. Furthermore, the shared transcription factors between independent C4 lineages are key targets for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa, Europe, and North America, several health care workers (HCWs) were infected, highlighting the need for a better understanding of EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments to develop new countermeasures. A study was conducted on a HCW infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in a high-isolation facility in Italy. The study aimed to explore the persistence of EBOV-specific negative sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), including replication intermediate (antigenomic-RNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma. The results showed that pos-RNA and neg-RNAs persisted in the lower respiratory tract even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replication. The study found that the levels of EBOV total RNA, neg-RNA, and pos-RNA decayed over time, with significant differences between plasma and respiratory samples. The detection of pos-RNA together with neg-RNA in sputum supported the concept of active viral replication within the respiratory tract, rather than plasma spill-over or prolonged RNA stability. The study's findings are consistent with a recent review of post-mortem examinations of fatal filoviral infections, which provided evidence of viral replication within the respiratory tract. The results suggest that EBOV can replicate in human airway tissues, which has implications for understanding human-to-human transmission and developing effective intervention strategies.
The ectodomain of the glycoprotein (GPC) from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of Junin virus (JUNV) has been found to contribute to the attenuation of Machupo virus (MACV) in mice lacking interferon-alpha/beta/gamma receptor (IFN-αβ/γ R-/-). A recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing the Cd#1 GPC is completely attenuated in a murine model and protects animals from lethal challenge with MACV. However, a rMACV with a single F438I substitution in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPC, equivalent to the F427I attenuating mutation in Cd#1 GPC, was attenuated in a murine model but genetically unstable. To investigate the requirement of different domains of Cd#1 GPC for successful attenuation of MACV, several rMACVs were rescued expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone (MCg1), along with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMACV, while MCg2 and MCg3 were completely attenuated and induced neutralizing antibody against Cd#1. The results suggest that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC plays an indispensable role in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC. This study provides new insights into the development of vaccine candidates for MACV and other New World arenaviruses.
The study investigated the role of point mutations in the centromeric histone 3 variant (CENH3) in Arabidopsis thaliana. CENH3 is essential for the segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. To understand the functional constraints of CENH3, researchers complemented a null allele with various mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone fold domain. The results showed that many of these transgenic missense lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination but exhibited post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This phenomenon is similar to the genome elimination syndromes observed with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species. The study also demonstrated that a single point mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, providing a simple method for identifying non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species. An in silico search for previously identified point mutations in CENH3 revealed an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution within the histone fold domain, which produced post-zygotic death and uniparental haploids when crossed to wild-type plants. The findings suggest that altering single conserved amino acid residues in the histone fold domain of CENH3 results in fit and fertile plants that display post-zygotic incompatibility and produce haploids when crossed to wild-type plants.
This study investigated the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. The researchers modified the H9 hESC line to allow for the selection of pluripotent hESCs and cardiac progenitors. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. The results showed that AS events corresponded to pathways involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control, as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. Using the AltAnalyze program, the researchers identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These changes included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. The study suggests that AS may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation. The results also imply that the loss of pluripotency corresponds to AS of genes that regulate transcription, cell-cell contact formation, and metabolism, while cardiac-enriched events favor contractile pathways, inhibition of neurogenesis, and Wnt signaling. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of AS in the differentiation of hESCs into cardiac precursors and identifies potential targets for driving the expression of pluripotent cells to distinct lineages.
Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase OtsA and T6P phosphatase OtsB2 play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of trehalose in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). To assess the potential of T6P phosphatase as a drug target, researchers generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allowed for the regulated silencing of the otsB2 gene. The results showed that otsB2 is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and during the acute infection phase in mice, but not during the chronic infection phase. The accumulation of T6P, the substrate of OtsB2, was found to be toxic to the cells, leading to self-poisoning. Blocking T6P production in a ΔotsA mutant abrogated the essentiality of otsB2, suggesting that T6P accumulation is the primary cause of otsB2 essentiality. The accumulation of T6P also led to a global upregulation of over 800 genes, which may result from an increase in RNA stability. A genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with otsA identified numerous genes, revealing additional potential drug targets that could be used in combination with OtsB2 inhibitors to minimize the emergence of resistance. The study highlights the importance of understanding the remodeling of trehalose metabolism in M. tuberculosis during infection and the potential of T6P phosphatase as a drug target.
Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TcPR) has been identified as a promising target for therapies against Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people. Current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles, making the development of new drugs urgent. TcPR is believed to modulate the exposure of critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune system evasion. To understand the conformational changes associated with substrate binding to TcPR, advanced accelerated molecular dynamics simulations were employed to extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions. The results revealed potential conformational epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified transient binding pockets. The newly identified open TcPR conformations, along with the knowledge of the closed to open interconversion mechanism, advance our understanding of TcPR function. Conservation and fragment mapping analyses indicate that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are likely associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes around previously unidentified binding pockets. These findings provide new insights for future structure-based drug discovery and constitute an important step toward the rationalization of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR. The results suggest that TcPR represents a promising target for therapies that may more efficiently combat Chagas' disease.
The development of an inducible and reversible mouse genetic rescue system has been achieved through the creation of a binary approach based on Tet-dependent regulatory technology. This system, named iKO, allows for the efficient production of reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice. The iKO system consists of two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. By treating the mice with doxycycline, the target gene can be turned on and off at will. The system has been engineered for high-throughput, large-scale, and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As a proof of concept, iKO mice were created in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, allowing for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications. This system complements existing inducible gene expression approaches and provides certain advantages, including reversibility, high efficiency, streamlined production, and flexibility. The iKO system has the potential to be used for a wide range of applications, including modeling human conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.
The study investigated the genetic response of the placental environment to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a murine model using two different strains: K98, a clone of the non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain, and VD, isolated from a human case of congenital infection. Microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression in placentas from uninfected animals and those infected with either strain. The results showed that the "Secretory Granule" pathway was down-regulated in both infected groups, while the "Innate Immune Response" and "Response to Interferon-gamma" pathways were up-regulated in VD-infected placentas but not in K98-infected placentas. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, and some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation in VD and K98 groups. Furthermore, VD strain showed a stronger tropism to the placental organ, with detection of parasite DNA and RNA, indicating living parasites. These findings suggest that the placental environment responds differently to T. cruzi infection depending on the parasite genotype, with a strong immune response in VD-infected placentas that may contribute to controlling infection and preventing congenital transmission. The study provides new insights into the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection and highlights the importance of considering the parasite genotype in understanding the risk of congenital transmission.
A seven-year cycle of Sindbis virus (SINV) outbreaks in northern Europe has been hypothesized based on reported human cases of polyarthritis and rash, also known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. To investigate this hypothesis, mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden were evaluated. Mosquitoes were collected from the River Dalälven floodplains during the years before, during, and after the hypothesized 2002 outbreak year and assayed for virus on cell culture. The obtained isolates were partially sequenced and analyzed using Bayesian maximum clade credibility and median joining network analysis. The results showed a significant increase in SINV prevalence in both enzootic and bridge-vector mosquitoes in 2002, with infection rates of 10.0/1000 in Culex torrentium/pipiens and 0.62/1000 in Aedes cinereus. Sequence analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I) and showed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years. The findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. The study provides the first objective markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe.
The study investigated the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms in the locust olfactory system, specifically the transformation of dense, transiently synchronized spike trains in the antenna lobe ( AL ) into a sparse representation in the mushroom body ( MB ). Recordings from the MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells ( KCs ), with typically only a few KCs from the recorded population responding reliably to a specific odor. Different odors induced responses in different KCs. A biologically plausible model was used to explore the possibility that plasticity may control and tune synaptic weights of inputs to the mushroom body to ensure the specificity of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. The results showed that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulated the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations. This suggests a role for plasticity in information processing and makes a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses. The findings are consistent with a recent set of experimental results supporting a pre-synaptic mechanism of plasticity between Kenyon cells and mushroom body extrinsic neurons as a critical process in olfactory memory.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). The study analyzed transcriptional profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and unaffected arterial wall, from 278 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Two-way clustering revealed 60 tissue clusters, with one cluster in atherosclerotic arterial wall and one in visceral fat segregating patients into two groups differing in coronary stenosis extent (P=0.008 and P=0.00015, respectively). The associations were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles, with 27 genes in the two clusters relating to coronary stenosis confirmed (n=16/17, P<10−27 and P<10−30). The transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway was overrepresented in all three clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module). The A-module was found to be genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold (P<0.004) in three independent cohorts. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2-deficient arterial wall. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis development, and LDB2 merits further attention in CAD research.
A two-loop transcriptional feedback mechanism has been identified in the cyanobacterial circadian clock of Synechococcus. This mechanism involves the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock, which undergoes different phospho-states during the 24-hour day-night cycle. Specifically, threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate the transcription of the kaiBC gene, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress its transcription. This two-loop feedback mechanism is able to reproduce existing experimental observations, including the effects of knockout or overexpression of kai genes. The model simulations suggest that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression is the main factor in how the different two-loop feedback models respond to removal or overexpression of kai genes. The proposed TTFL/PTO model, which combines a post-translational oscillator with a transcriptional/translational feedback loop, provides a comprehensive explanation for the regulation of kaiBC expression and its role in the cyanobacterial circadian clock. This model has the potential to reveal how the circadian output pathways allow the KaiC protein to control several hundred rhythmically regulated genes in the cyanobacterial genome. The findings have parallels with two-loop feedback structures found in the mammalian clock, highlighting the conserved nature of circadian clock mechanisms across different organisms.
The study investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals infected with HIV-2, a virus known for its low pathogenicity and replicative potential. The researchers analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 antiretroviral-naive HIV-2-infected individuals, including 12 non-progressors and 2 progressors. The results showed that HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals, but was quantifiable in transitional-memory CD4 T-cells (TTM) from 4 individuals and in central-memory CD4 T-cells (TCM) from only 1 individual. HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs positively correlated with those in TTM, but not TCM. Reactivation of HIV-2 was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. The study also found that TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts compared to TTM. These findings suggest that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of the CXCR6 co-receptor and a higher expression of the restriction factor TRIM5. The results provide new insights into the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection and suggest mechanisms similar to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection. The study highlights the importance of understanding the determinants of the atypical distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs among memory CD4 T-cells.
The article presents the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) model, a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the cortex. The model is implemented in spiking neurons and maps computations for selective attentional processing to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The ARC model provides a unified explanation of various attentional effects, including shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features (response gain), and the effect on contrast-response functions being better explained as a response-gain effect than as contrast-gain. The model is consistent with a wide array of available data and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions. The ARC's mechanisms for selective routing predict that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions, distinguishing it from the normalization model. The model also predicts that an increasing proportion of neurons at each higher cortical level will show attentional modulation, with the magnitude of modulation increasing in higher cortical areas. The ARC is demonstrated to quantitatively match several observed forms of attentional modulation in macaque studies, providing a single mechanism that unifies the above forms of attentional modulation.
A large-scale whole exome sequencing study was conducted to investigate the genetic contribution to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and heritable arrhythmia. The study analyzed data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 controls from four community-based cohorts, including the Framingham Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and NHLBI-GO Exome Sequencing Project. None of the 99,404 common variants evaluated was significantly associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. However, a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene (rs3812629, p.Pro707Leu) was identified as the most significantly associated variant, with an odds ratio of 1.27 (95% CI 1.13-1.43, P = 6.6x10-5). This variant lies at a known AF susceptibility locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a top marker from prior analyses at the locus. The study did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests, and individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. The results suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF, and further evaluation is needed to determine whether the identified variant in SYNPO2L is causally related to AF. The study highlights the need for large sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 human cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis were detected in Poland. The cases were verified by clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria, with 83 (68.6%) classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The majority of cases (76) were diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease, with the liver being the primary location of AE in all cases. In 30 (24.8%) patients, the disease had spread to other organs. The mean age at diagnosis was 47.7 years, with a sex ratio of 0.86:1.0 (male to female). The disease was fatal in 23 (19%) patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. A total of 94 patients were treated with albendazole, and 73 (60%) underwent surgical operation, including 15 liver transplantations. The study found a continuous increase in the detection rate of AE cases over the two-decade period. The results suggest that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, which is the fourth country in Europe with over 120 cases detected. The study highlights the need for a wider national program to implement screening in high-risk areas and increase public awareness of the possibility of contracting E. multilocularis, as well as training primary care physicians to recognize the risk of AE for early detection.
The study investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli (E. coli) at each of the known Zur-regulated genes. The researchers solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and found that Zur represses gene expression by forming a highly cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to the promoter. This cooperative binding requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49′ that connect otherwise independent dimers. The study also identified a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. The pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur-regulon promoters. The in vitro Zur-DNA binding affinity at each of four Zur-regulon promoters reveals a 10,000-fold variation in binding constants. The degree of Zur repression observed in vivo parallels this trend, spanning a 100-fold difference. The study suggests that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. The findings provide strong support for the idea that the thermodynamics of an ensemble of protein-DNA interactions play a dominant role in the physiological control of gene regulation networks.
A spatially explicit metapopulation model and cattle trade analysis were used to investigate the recurrent circulation of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in the Anjozorobe district of Madagascar highlands following a 2008-2009 outbreak. The study aimed to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission. Observational data collected in the area showed that Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vector of RVFV, were absent, and the overall mosquito abundance was low due to unfavorable climatic conditions. However, a three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle revealed a recurrent RVFV circulation. A spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed to reproduce the local conditions. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering due to direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, (ii) low-level vector-based circulation during winter, and (iii) a combination of both mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods selected a model incorporating both low-level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. This model satisfactorily reproduced field observations, attributing 84% of cattle infections to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission. The results suggest that interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices are key elements for understanding RVFV circulation in this area. The study highlights the importance of considering both vector-borne and direct transmission mechanisms in understanding the epidemiology of RVFV in the Madagascar highlands.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito that poses a significant public health threat in its expanding range. To understand the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region, researchers analyzed 13 nuclear microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was employed to test competing historical routes of invasion of Ae. albopictus within the Southeast Asian/Australasian region. The results suggest that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or Southeast Asia. The analysis also indicates that the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded chiefly from Indonesia. A recently colonized population in the Torres Strait Islands has undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source. The study reveals high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations, with the species' genetic structure in the region favoring a dispersal pattern driven mostly by human movements. The study provides a more widespread sampling distribution of the species' native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown, and presents the most probable invasion history of Ae. albopictus in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.
In a cross-sectional study conducted in Mwanza Region, North-Western Tanzania, researchers investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years. The study found that 58.7% of the children were infected with S. mansoni, with an average intensity of 207.3 eggs per gram of feces. Most infections were light, while 16.4% were heavy. Girls had significantly higher infection intensities than boys. The study also found that 30.1% of the children were anemic, but there was no association between S. mansoni infection and anthropometry, liver or spleen pathology. However, children with S. mansoni infection had a significantly lower score in the emotional dimension of quality of life compared to uninfected children. In contrast, infected children had a higher VO2 max (a measure of physical fitness) compared to uninfected children. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, hemoglobin, and VO2 max were significant predictors of emotional quality of life, while physical quality of life, height, age, and hemoglobin were significant predictors of VO2 max. The study concluded that S. mansoni infection had a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness. The findings suggest that the PedsQL tool may not be a useful measure of schistosome-related morbidity, and further studies are needed to refine the tool to focus on aspects of quality of life affected by schistosome infections.
This study compared the effects of mucosal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal inoculation routes on Leptospira infection in adult rats. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Leptospira, with wild rodents, including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), serving as the main reservoir. The intraperitoneal route has been used in previous studies, but it is a non-natural route of infection in rat colonies, and the details of transmission between rats remain unknown. The study aimed to investigate the effects of mucosal and subcutaneous inoculation routes on renal colonization and urinary excretion of Leptospira infection compared to the intraperitoneal route. The results showed that Leptospira infection was asymptomatic using each inoculation route, and antibody production was similar regardless of renal colonization. The observed renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for the intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous inoculation routes, respectively. Mucosal inoculation was found to be more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. These findings can facilitate understanding of the infection modalities in rats and may help explain the heterogeneity of renal carriage in rat colonies from the same region. Future studies of other natural inoculation routes in rat models will increase knowledge of rat-rat disease transmission and allow investigation of infection kinetics.
This study investigates the role of Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in modulating the inflammatory response during polymicrobial sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction. The researchers used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to induce sepsis in mice and found that AnxA2-deficient (anxa2-/-) mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, AnxA2 deficiency led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 is crucial for regulating ROS levels. The study also found that ROS is responsible for elevated IL-17A levels and subsequent exaggerated inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 knockout strategy down-regulated inflammation and conferred protection against sepsis in anxa2-/- mice. The findings suggest that AnxA2 modulates the inflammatory response in sepsis via an AnxA2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing new insights into the regulation of sepsis pathophysiology. The study highlights the potential therapeutic value of targeting AnxA2 or IL-17 in sepsis treatment.
The study investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV-1 effects of Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation in macrophages. HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, have been shown to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The study found that poly(I:C)- and LPS-stimulation of MDMs abrogated infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1, and by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed increased miR-155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4-stimulation, and a miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated MDMs. Ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines. The study suggests that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the rhythmic growth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in response to daily light/dark cycles. The researchers used DNA microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seedlings under various growth conditions and mutant backgrounds. The results showed that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. This expression is correlated with the presence of a cis-acting element ( CACATG ) in phytohormone gene promoters, which is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. The study also found that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation. The study suggests that the circadian clock acts upstream of light signaling to gate phytohormone gene expression during the early evening, and that the circadian clock and light signaling pathways interact to coordinate the expression of biosynthetic, catabolic, receptor, and signaling genes from multiple phytohormone pathways. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the rhythmic growth of plants in response to daily light/dark cycles.
Genetically modifying the gut microbiota of Rhodnius prolixus, the primary vector of Chagas disease, has been explored as a potential strategy for sustainable vector control. Researchers used Escherichia coli HT115 (DE3) expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for the Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) to induce RNA interference (RNAi) in the insect. The results showed that feeding nymphs and adult triatomine stages with E. coli HT115 (DE3) expressing dsRNA for RHBP and CAT led to significant gene knockdown in various tissues, including the fat body, anterior and posterior midgut, and ovaries. The RNAi effect was systemic and temporal, with RHBP expression reduced by 99% three days after feeding and returning to normal levels 10 days after feeding. CAT expression was reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and posterior midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. The study also found that mortality rates increased by 24-30% in first instars fed RHBP and CAT bacteria, molting rates were reduced by 100% in first instars and 80% in third instars, and oviposition was reduced by 43% (RHBP) and 84% (CAT). Furthermore, feeding females 10^5 CFU/mL of the natural symbiont, Rhodococcus rhodnii, transformed to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA reduced RHBP expression by 89% and reduced oviposition. These findings suggest that modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control.
In a study conducted on the Thai-Burmese border, fever in pregnancy was found to be a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Between 2004 and 2006, approximately 5% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics experienced febrile episodes, with malaria being the primary cause in 55.5% of these cases. However, despite the decline in malaria incidence in the region, it remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy. Arthropod-borne diseases, including malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue, as well as zoonotic diseases like leptospirosis, accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses in pregnant women. Coinfections were observed in 3.9% of women, with malaria and rickettsia being the most common combination. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever, affecting 19.7% of women. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. The study highlights the need for a better understanding of the causes of febrile illness in pregnant women in rural tropical areas to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The findings suggest that pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border who do not have malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, which is effective against typhus and leptospirosis.
The study examined the relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans using a panel of 69 French-Canadian pedigrees with over 600,000 markers genotyped. The results showed a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, which was localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. This effect was observed on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and on two chromosomes in the Hutterites. The study suggests that chromosome-specific effects may be critical determinants of the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans, and that these effects may vary among populations due to genetic differences in factors regulating the recombination machinery. The findings support the hypothesis that protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age, which can contribute to higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. The study proposes a model that reconciles these findings with reported associations between maternal age and recombination in cases of trisomies. The results highlight the importance of considering chromosome-specific effects in understanding the mechanisms involved in human trisomies and the impact of maternal age on recombination rates. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans.
A novel approach to induce innate memory in macrophages in vivo has been developed using interferon-γ (IFN-γ) priming. Unlike traditional trained immunity models, this method results in a prolonged innate memory-like phenotype in macrophages that persists for at least 70 days post-immunization and provides complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. RNA-seq analysis of IFN-γ primed macrophages revealed a rapid up-regulation of IFN-γ and STAT1 signaling pathways following secondary challenge, leading to enhanced cytokine recall responses that are pathogen-specific and dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation. Notably, increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity was observed in immunized, unchallenged pulmonary macrophages, correlating with their ability to quickly respond to secondary challenge. This study demonstrates an alternative mechanism to induce macrophage innate memory in vivo that facilitates pathogen-specific vaccine-mediated immune responses. The findings suggest that immunization strategies driving memory-like innate immune responses may provide a novel and effective mechanism for inducing vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of the STAT1 pathway in memory-like innate priming and its correlation with training in the context of microbial infection rather than microbial by-products.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, the depletion of different members of PRCs causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism determining the target specificity and functional diversity of PRCs is not sufficiently characterized. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of PRCs in Arabidopsis by comparing the changes of tri-methylation at H3K27 in mutants deprived of various key PRC components. The results show that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in the suppression of distinct plant developmental programs. The expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via a non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associates with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, the expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN). The context-dependent role of CLF corresponds well with the change in H3K27me3 profiles and is remarkably associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS box and ABA-related factors. The study proposes that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific TFs.
A high-resolution phenotypic landscape of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) trigger loop (TL) has been generated by quantitatively phenotyping nearly all TL single variants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study reveals three mutant classes with distinct distributions among TL residues, linked to transcription defects or various stresses. Mutations disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to provide a mechanism for substrate-triggered TL folding, confer phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Additionally, allele-specific genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal domain residues support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices to TL dynamics.

The phenotypic landscape sheds light on the functional contribution of TL residues to its dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints. The study expands the current scope of existing deep mutational scanning studies and can be generalized to study most, if not all, of the yeast proteins. The results indicate that both intra-TL interactions and TL interactions with nearby domains are critical for TL function. Coupled with structures of partially folded TL states, these genetic studies support a multi-step TL folding model for the promotion of catalysis. The study identifies many predicted gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) TL variants, some of which are predicted to confer epistatic interactions. The findings provide insights into the dynamic conversion between TL states and their critical functions in transcriptional activity.
The study investigated the pathogenesis of rabies virus (RV) in mice after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation with two RV strains: DOG4, associated with dogs, and SB, associated with silver-haired bats. The results showed that while both strains caused lethal encephalopathy after i.m. infection, only SB caused a lethal infection after i.v. inoculation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that i.v.-administered SB directly infected the forebrain, with the earliest affected regions being hypothalamic nuclei connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. The study suggests that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV. The study highlights the importance of considering hematogenous spread in the pathogenesis of RV and its potential role in the development of lethal encephalopathy.
The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since its first documented global pandemic in 1918. To understand the evolutionary history of this virus, researchers analyzed 71 complete genome sequences of A/H1N1 viruses sampled between 1918 and 2006. The study found that segmental reassortment has played a crucial role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. These findings suggest that intra-subtype reassortment is a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized. The study also highlights the importance of reassortment in generating viruses with pandemic potential, as seen in the emergence of H2N2 and H3N2 strains in 1957 and 1968. The results of this study provide new insights into the evolutionary history of A/H1N1 and have implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of this virus.
A computational model of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was used to investigate the principal pathway of nicotine action. The study aimed to determine whether nicotine exerts its reinforcing action through direct stimulation of dopamine (DA) cells or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons. The model illustrated that α4β2-containing nAChRs on either DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. The study accounted for both in vitro and in vivo data and predicted the conditions necessary for either direct stimulation or disinhibition to be the origin of DA activity increases. The rate of endogenous acetylcholine input was found to be crucial in determining the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. The results suggest that the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement. The study identified that low endogenous cholinergic input rates are necessary for direct stimulation, while high cholinergic inputs are required for disinhibition. The findings reconcile in vitro and in vivo data and provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of nicotine action in the VTA. The study highlights the importance of the GABAergic cells in the action of nicotine and proposes key experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms.
A randomized controlled phase IIa trial was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) and hydrogel wound care with or without DAC N-055 in treating anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica. The study included 113 patients with CL, who were randomly assigned to two groups: one received EC followed by daily moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel containing DAC N-055 (group I), and the other received EC followed by MWT without DAC N-055 (group II). The primary outcome was the time needed for complete lesion epithelialization. Biopsies were taken before EC, after wound closure, and six months later for parasitological and histopathological analysis. The mean duration for complete wound closure was similar in both groups (43.1 days in group I and 42 days in group II). However, in patients with Leishmania-positive biopsies after wound closure, the addition of DAC N-055 resulted in faster wound epithelialization (37.2 days vs. 58.3 days). Superinfections occurred at the same rate in both groups (8.8%), but reulcerations were more common in group II (18.5% vs. 10.2%). In vitro, DAC N-055 showed a leishmanicidal effect on both pro- and amastigotes. The study suggests that EC plus MWT is a more effective treatment for CL than intralesional antimony injections, and the addition of DAC N-055 may further accelerate wound closure and reduce relapse rates.
A genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells was conducted to identify factors functionally linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments were performed on individual candidates to determine their position relative to core pathway components, revealing several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway. Unexpectedly, most hits were found to work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. Further characterization of two representative members of this group revealed that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. The study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Core splicing components were found to specifically impact alternative splicing. The screen also identified five novel components acting upstream of RAF and several new factors acting at the RAS-RAF and RAF-MEK intervals. The results indicate that the regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling is more complex than previously thought and highlights the importance of splicing in modulating pathway output.
Title: Molecular Epidemiology Reveals Genetic Diversity amongst Isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii Species Complex in Thailand

    A retrospective study of 498 Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii isolates from Thailand was conducted to gain a more detailed understanding of cryptococcosis in the country. The majority of the isolates (94.8%) were identified as C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source, including clinical (94.6%), environmental (98.8%), and veterinary (86.2%) isolates. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis revealed a total of 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with ST30 for C. gattii and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to Thailand. Most C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a potential stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The study found a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The majority of C. neoformans isolates were from HIV patients (88.5%), while C. gattii was mainly a primary pathogen in immunocompetent patients. The study highlights the importance of further research on the epidemiology and virulence of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex for proper disease management in Thailand.
The study investigated the role of transcription factor (TF) variation in the evolution of regulatory networks across 12 Drosophila species spanning approximately 45 million years of evolution. The researchers focused on the Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, the largest class of metazoan TFs. They found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. These variations include loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF domains, as well as diverging DNA-contacting residues in approximately 44% of domains shared between Drosophila melanogaster and other fly species. The diverging DNA-contacting residues show evidence of functional constraint, tending to be conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolving slower than other diverging residues. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D. melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. The study suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans. The findings challenge the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provide evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
The development of serotype-specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays for Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, is crucial for rapid and accurate diagnosis in clinical and public health laboratories. However, existing PCR protocols often rely on non-optimal validation steps and use multiple markers for each targeted serotype. In this study, a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), was used as a serotype-specific target to develop a conventional multiplex PCR assay and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR assays for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. The assays were validated on a large collection of strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, as well as on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections. The results showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol. The CRISPR targets were found to be highly stable and specific, making them suitable for the specific detection of all populations of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. The developed assays are expected to facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these two major serotypes in a wide range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. The CRISPR-based PCR assays can be used with DNA from cultured isolates, and with modifications, they can be adapted for use with clinical and other samples.
Mice with T cell-specific gene ablation of Notch1 (N1), Notch2 (N2), or both (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were infected with the protozoan parasite Leishmania major to investigate the role of Notch signaling in Th1 cell differentiation. Mice lacking both N1 and N2 (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia, with impaired secretion of IFNγ by draining lymph node CD4+ T cells and increased secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 Th2 cytokines. In contrast, mice with single inactivation of N1 or N2 in their T cells were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response. This suggests that CD4+ T cell expression of N1 or N2 is redundant in driving Th1 differentiation. Notch signaling was found to be required for the secretion of IFNγ by Th1 cells, and this effect was independent of CSL/RBP-Jκ, the major effector of Notch receptors. Mice with a RBP-Jκ deletion in their T cells were able to develop IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells, kill parasites, and heal their lesions. The study demonstrates a crucial role for RBP-Jκ-independent Notch signaling in the differentiation of a functional Th1 immune response following L. major infection. The findings have implications for the development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic targets towards Leishmania pathology and other infections requiring a protective IFNγ-secreting CD4+ Th1 immune response.
This study investigated whether pre-existing infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni increases susceptibility to systemic infection with the simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C) in rhesus macaques. Two groups of animals, one consisting of normal monkeys and the other harboring S. mansoni, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R5-tropic SHIV-C. The results showed that systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. Specifically, the 50% animal infectious (AID50) SHIV-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls. Coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads and increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells. These findings provide the first direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition. The study suggests that control of helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1. The results have significant implications for areas of the world where both parasitic worms and HIV-1 are endemic, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 62% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases occur. The study's findings support the suggestion that better control of helminth infections may favorably impact efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.
The article presents a biophysical model of cholinergic modulation in the cortex, focusing on the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in regulating neural excitability and network dynamics. The model consists of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with an M-current regulated by ACh, which reduces spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shifts the phase response curve (PRC). The results show that changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous patterns of activity. These regimes are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of cortical activity during slow-wave sleep (SWS), REM sleep, and waking states. The model demonstrates that the level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity and that ACh-induced changes in SFA level and PRC shape occur over differing values of gKs¯. The findings suggest that ACh plays a crucial role in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from these patterns. The model also shows that large-scale spatio-temporal dynamics can be induced by ACh-mediated SFA, and that neural networks composed of highly excitable cells will be more responsive to synaptic heterogeneities. The results provide insights into the role and significance of ACh in determining patterns of cortical activity during different sleep and wake states.
The study investigated the impact of mutations in Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway genes on esophageal carcinogenesis. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) develops in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity. The researchers hypothesized that mutations targeting the TLR pathway could disrupt innate immune signaling and promote tumorigenesis. They analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affected the TLR pathway in 25/171 (14.6%) tumors. TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease, indicating possible clinical significance. The study also validated these findings in an external EAC dataset and in other solid tumor types exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endometrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. TLR4 was the most frequently mutated gene, with 11 mutations in 10/171 (5.8%) EAC tumors. The TLR4 mutants E439G, S570I, F703C, and R787H were confirmed to have impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked reductions in signaling by luciferase reporter assays. The study suggests that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC, and TLR4 mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
The development of the taste system in mice has been investigated using a novel approach combining in silico and in vivo analyses. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. Taste receptor calcium signaling molecules ( TRCSMs ) were found to colocalize within developing circumvallate papillae ( CVP ), suggesting a common regulatory network for TRCSM transcription. Computational analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of TRCSMs identified Hes1 as a likely common regulatory factor. The role of Hes1 in taste system development was further examined in vivo. Expression profile analyses revealed that decreased expression of nuclear HES1 correlated with the expression of type II taste cell markers. In Hes1−/− mutants, the CVP displayed over 5-fold more TRCSM-immunoreactive cells than in wild-type littermates after stage E18. These findings suggest that Hes1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. The study provides new insights into the molecular regulation of taste system development and highlights the importance of Hes1 in this process. The results support the possibility that Hes1 is a common regulator of taste bud cell differentiation and provide a foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms of taste cell development.
The activation of OsEIL1 on YUC8/REIN7 transcription and auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedling development. In rice, ethylene and auxin interact to regulate root growth and development, but their interaction is distinct from that in Arabidopsis. The study found that OsEIL1 directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7, a gene involved in auxin biosynthesis. YUC8/REIN7 catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) to indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ), a key step in auxin biosynthesis. The study used a YUC activity inhibitor to show that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, was identified, which has a truncated YUC8/REIN7 gene and reduced auxin biosynthesis. Overexpression of YUC8/REIN7 enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. The study also found that ethylene induces YUC8/REIN7 expression and promotes auxin accumulation in roots. Addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1 mutant, demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. These findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation and provide new insights into ethylene signaling in rice. The study highlights the importance of YUC8/REIN7 in auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings.
A nationwide epidemiological study was conducted in Saudi Arabia to investigate the incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. The study collected 527 NTM isolates over a 24-month period and analyzed them against clinical and demographic data. The results showed that 75.1% of the isolates were of pulmonary origin, with 44.7% having proven clinical significance. A total of 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species, were identified, with M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuitum (18.1%), and M. abscessus (17.8%) being the most prevalent. Notably, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were detected. The study also identified rare clinical events caused by M. wolinskyi, M. holsaticum, M. duvalii, and M. monacence. Diabetes mellitus and a previous history of tuberculosis were found to be independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. The study highlights the emerging challenge of NTM disease spectrum and pathogen diversity in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the need for immediate development of diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans. The findings suggest that the Saudi population is vulnerable to NTM diseases, and a detailed management plan for mycobacterial disease control is necessary. The study also underscores the importance of addressing the emergence of new pathogens, such as M. riyadhense, and difficult-to-treat species like M. simiae.
Chronological lifespan (CLS) in yeast is dependent on the accumulation of storage carbohydrates, which is mediated by the kinases Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15. When yeast cells are starved of glucose or other macronutrients, they exit the mitotic cell cycle and acquire characteristics specific to quiescent cells to ensure longevity. A subset of the yeast deletion library was screened to identify the molecular determinants that orchestrate quiescence entry and lifespan extension. In addition to previously characterized Rim15, Mck1, and Yak1 kinases, the SNF1/AMPK complex, cell wall integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators were found to be necessary for proper quiescence establishment and CLS extension. The CLS of signaling mutants and single, double, and triple mutants of RIM15, YAK1, and MCK1 correlates well with the amount of storage carbohydrates but poorly with transition-phase cell cycle status. The combined removal of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes severely reduces CLS, while overexpression of GSY2 and TSL1 or supplementation of trehalose to the growth medium ameliorates the severe CLS defects. The kinases Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 mediate the TOR1-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and CLS extension, and their levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species are cooperatively controlled. The data support the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy stores and the activation of anti-oxidant defense systems are coordinated by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 kinases to ensure quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast.
Influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation has been found to play a crucial role in compensating for fitness defects resulting from escape from anti-HA neutralizing antibodies. Using the primerID method of error-correcting viral population sequencing, researchers revealed that antibody-free propagation following antigenic escape rapidly selected viruses with mutations that modulated receptor binding avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain. This finding expands our understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution to include glycan addition. The study highlights the immense power of high-definition virus population sequencing to reveal novel viral adaptive mechanisms. The results suggest that glycosylation can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on HA, increasing the viability and emergence potential of antibody-escape variants. Furthermore, the study reveals that glycosylation can also play a role in increasing the fitness of antigenic escape variants by restoring optimal HA receptor interactions, even in the absence of antibody selective pressure. These findings shed light on the unique mutational plasticity of influenza HA and highlight the remarkable potential of highly accurate virus population sequencing and high-definition forward genetics for exploring viral evolution.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models to identify targets that exhibit favorable rate dependence. Reverse rate dependence is a problematic property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP), resulting in reduced arrhythmia suppression at fast rates and increased arrhythmia risk at slow rates. To address this issue, the study simulated populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzed population results statistically to predict the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple model parameters. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on AP duration were assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates. The analysis identified a variety of forward rate-dependent (FRD) ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. For instance, an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. The study also found that inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump are the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. A statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential. This can explain differences between species and between ventricular cell types. The study provides new insights into the determinants of AP duration rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for the design of potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
This study presents a novel approach to Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and biological test results to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with a quantitative trait, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. The authors developed two aggregation methods for ICD-10 codes, an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes, and analyzed 11 biological test results using discretization algorithms. The study included 442 patient records from a French academic hospital between 2000 and 2013, representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant, and cross-validation with biological test results validated the ICD phenotypes. The study identified associations between very high TPMT activity and iron-deficiency anemia (p = 0.0004) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0015). The authors describe an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results to identify associated phenotypes. This approach allows for the identification of new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management in the field of pharmacogenomics. The study highlights the potential of PheWAS to discover new associations between genetic polymorphisms and clinical data in the context of thiopurine treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 156 animal studies on stem cell transplantation in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of stem cells in restoring neurological function. The analysis included 45 different stem cell preparations, with only one study using autologous stem cells. The results showed that allogeneic stem cell treatment significantly improved both motor (effect size: 27.2%, 95% CI: 25.0-29.4%) and sensory (effect size: 26.3%, 95% CI: 7.9-44.7%) outcomes in animal models of SCI. However, the efficacy of stem cell implantation was influenced by various factors, including the route of delivery, differentiation before implantation, and the presence of immunosuppression. The analysis also found that the location of injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression had an impact on motor outcomes. Furthermore, studies that did not report blinded assessment of outcome gave inflated estimates of efficacy. The results suggest that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise in treating SCI, but the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias may lead to an overestimation of efficacy. The study highlights the need for rigorous reporting of measures to reduce bias and the importance of considering the conditions under which animal experiments demonstrate greatest efficacy.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary control strategy. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. The analysis included 51 studies that reported STH infection rates pre- and post-treatment. The results showed that at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides reinfection reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, the respective reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67%, and 82%, and for hookworm, 30%, 55%, and 57%. The prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. The study found that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. The findings suggest that frequent anthelmintic drug administrations are necessary to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are needed to interrupt transmission of STH.
Title: Investigating the deregulation of metabolic tasks via Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) as applied to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease using mouse and human omics data

    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of metabolic syndromes, from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To identify the molecular-level deregulation underlying these phenotypes, researchers have employed pathway enrichment analysis (PEA). However, PEA relies on predefined pathway maps, which are subject to biases associated with different pathway annotations and cannot capture the complex interactions of genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs).

    To address these limitations, a new framework called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) has been developed. MiNEA generates all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs) composed of reactions pertaining to various metabolic subsystems that can synthesize a target metabolite. By applying MiNEA to GEMs, researchers can identify deregulated MiNs and key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice.

    Using condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples, MiNEA identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice. The analysis also revealed that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. Furthermore, MiNEA demonstrated the general and specific characteristics of the different NAFLD phenotypes. The MiNEA framework is applicable to any GEM and target metabolite, making it a flexible tool for studying condition-specific metabolism in various diseases or organisms.
The olfactory system faces the challenge of identifying a vast array of odors independent of their intensity. Primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, is proposed as a compact and informative representation that can be efficiently interpreted by the brain. A simple model of primacy coding was analyzed using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions. The results show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful for performing typical olfactory tasks with performance comparable to experimentally measured values. The model also suggests that a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors in certain situations. Furthermore, the model predicts that overly sensitive receptor types can dominate the response and render the entire array useless, indicating the need for receptor arrays to adapt to environmental changes. Primacy coding is found to be more useful than simple binary and normalized coding due to the sparsity of odor representations being independent of odor statistics. This efficient odor representation is independent of odor intensity and may aid in identifying odors in the olfactory cortex. The results suggest that the primacy code formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful for identifying odors in the subsequent olfactory cortex than simple alternatives. The model predicts that receptors are only useful if their likelihood to respond to incoming odors is similar.
The study investigated the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) targeting different regions of the HIV envelope (Env) spike. Using a panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell assay and 117 viruses in the TZM-bl assay, the researchers found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 were more likely to display non-sigmoidal neutralization curves that plateaued at less than 100% neutralization. In contrast, bnMAbs targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to show this behavior. The study also found that two CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies showed this behavior relatively infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was observed in a large peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-grown molecular virus clone panel derived from patient viral swarms. Additionally, five bnMAbs were compared against an 18-virus panel of molecular clones produced in 293T cells and PBMCs and assayed in TZM-bl cells, with examples of plateaus less than 90% seen with both types of virus production. The results suggest that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in both cell lines and primary cells. This has implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves, which may be influenced by factors such as glycan heterogeneity and conformational heterogeneity of the Env trimer.
The article presents a computational model of human central metabolism to elucidate how cancer cells utilize glucose and glutamine to promote growth. The model reveals that at high glutamine utilization rates, oxidative glucose utilization is decreased, while lactate production from glutamine is enhanced. This metabolic pattern is optimal for maximizing biomass and ATP production, requiring a branched tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and redox-controlled metabolic reactions. The model predicts that glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates with the production of lipids and proteins. Experimental validation in a K-ras transformed cell line confirms the computational results, demonstrating glutamine-induced metabolic changes. The findings suggest that the competition between glucose and glutamine utilization may play a crucial role in cancer cell growth. The model identifies boundary conditions that promote the emergence of cancer metabolic rewiring, characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and glutamine utilization for biosynthesis. Systematic evaluation of metabolic network wirings under different nutritional conditions reveals that this metabolic pattern is optimal for biomass and ATP production. The results provide new insights into the logic of metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer cell growth and suggest that this metabolic rewiring may occur in various tumor cell lines.
Interactome Analyses Identify Ties of PrPC and Its Mammalian Paralogs to Oligomannosidic N-Glycans and Endoplasmic Reticulum-Derived Chaperones
    A quantitative investigation of the cellular prion protein ( PrPC ) interactome was conducted in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. The study also extended to Doppel ( Prnd ) and Shadoo ( Sprn ), two mammalian PrPC paralogs, to facilitate recognition of relevant interactors. The results established a similar physiological environment for the three prion protein family members in neuroblastoma cells and suggested direct interactions amongst them. Multiple interactions between PrPC and the neural cell adhesion molecule, the laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases ( PDI ) were confirmed, reconciling previously separate findings. Validation experiments established that interactions of PrPC with PDIs may extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and play a hitherto unrecognized role in the accumulation of PrPSc. A hypothesis was presented suggesting that PrPC organizes its molecular environment by binding to adhesion molecules harboring immunoglobulin-like domains, which recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. Bioinformatic methods and literature mining were used to explore the known cellular localization of candidate interactors. The majority of these proteins co-purified with all three bait proteins, indicating a highly similar molecular environment for the three members of the mammalian prion protein family in mouse neuroblastoma cells. The study suggests that members of the prion protein family may be embedded in specialized membrane domains characterized by an extended molecular network supporting functions in adhesion control, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion events. Biochemical interactions among the members of the mammalian prion protein family exist.
During influenza virus infection, a robust type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokine immune response is typically induced in the respiratory tract. However, the production of type 2 cytokines, including interleukin ( IL ) -5, has also been observed. IL-5 is a prototypical type 2 cytokine that plays a crucial role in eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. In a mouse model of influenza virus infection, IL-5 was found to be transiently released into the infected airways along with a significant accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase following virus clearance. The cellular source of IL-5 was identified as group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 ) that infiltrate the infected lungs. The production of IL-5 by ILC2 was found to be regulated by NKT cells and alveolar macrophages, which produce IL-33, a cytokine that enhances IL-5 production by ILC2. The interaction between ILC2 and IL-33 producing NKT cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the abundant production of IL-5 by ILC2, resulting in the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs during the recovery phase of influenza infection. This study provides new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of IL-5 production during respiratory virus infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively analyzed 102 cases of iNTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. The majority of patients (71%) were HIV-infected adults, with 71% being male and 33% reporting intravenous drug use. The most commonly identified serovars were Salmonella Enteritidis (ST11) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST19, 34, and 1544), which accounted for 43% and 30% of all cases, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium was significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.003). Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037). The mortality rate was 28%, with HIV infection being a significant risk factor for death (p = 0.039). The study highlights that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam, with a high mortality rate, and that HIV infection is a major risk factor for both infection and death. The findings suggest that continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for the emergence or introduction of multidrug-resistant strains or strains with enhanced virulence.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been trained to detect viral and phage structural proteins with high accuracy. The ANNs were designed to classify phage protein sequences based on amino acid frequencies and protein isoelectric points. The networks were trained on a dataset of phage and viral-encoded genes and were able to correctly classify a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. The ANNs were also able to identify specialized families of proteins, such as major capsid and tail proteins, with high accuracy. To experimentally validate the ANN predictions, several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins were examined by transmission electron microscopy, and some self-assembled into structures resembling virion structures. The ANNs are valuable tools for identifying phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. The networks will be particularly useful when sequence data is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible. The ANNs have the potential to aid in the detection and diagnosis of disease, vaccine development, and understanding the physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health.
The interferon-stimulated gene product oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) has been identified as an interacting partner of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF20 protein. ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, and its function and role in the viral life cycle were not well understood. Quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) revealed that OASL interacts with ORF20, and this interaction is conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OASL interacting partners by q-AP-MS identified a similar interactome to that of ORF20, including ribosomal proteins. Both ORF20 and OASL copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, and when co-expressed, they associated with polysomes. ORF20 enhanced RIG-I-induced expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner. Notably, OASL has been characterized as an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesvirus infections was unknown. The study found that OASL enhanced infection of KSHV, and during infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. These data suggest that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection.
A prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. The study included 913 consecutive febrile children aged 1 month to 15 years admitted to the Children’s Emergency Room of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital over a 1-year period. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI = 1.9%, 5.7%) in febrile admissions, with 3/108 (2.8%) in children with convulsions and 10/265 (3.8%) in those without convulsions. The odds ratio of LVD in children with convulsions versus those without was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.2, 2.7), indicating no significant association between LVD and convulsions. However, vomiting (OR = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.70) and bleeding (OR = 39.56; 95% CI = 8.52, 183.7) were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The study highlights the importance of LVD as a cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever, in children in endemic areas, and underscores the need for a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. The findings suggest that screening febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD could be an important medical and public health control measure.
The study investigated the role of the karrikin receptor KAI2 in regulating drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations in KAI2 resulted in hypersensitivity to water deprivation, characterized by increased rates of water loss, drought-induced cell membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. Transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses revealed that kai2 mutants have reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought and are hyposensitive to abscisic acid ( ABA ) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes associated with the observed physiological and biochemical changes in kai2 plants under both well-watered and dehydration conditions. The data suggest crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. A comparison with the strigolactone receptor mutant d14 ( DWARF14 ) indicated that strigolactones also contribute to plant drought adaptation, although not by affecting cuticle development. The findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 and D14 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance. The study provides evidence for a KAR/KL-KAI2-SCFMAX2 signaling cascade in regulating plant drought adaptation through controlling cell membrane stability, stomatal movement, cuticle development, and anthocyanin production. KAI2-mediated signaling positively regulates drought resistance in Arabidopsis by activating downstream genes involved in cuticle formation, stomatal closure, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and membrane integrity.
The study investigated the role of insulin receptors (SjIRs) in the growth, development, sexual maturation, and egg production of adult Schistosoma japonicum, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis japonica. The researchers cloned and partially characterized the SjIRs and demonstrated that human insulin can bind to the L1 subdomain of the recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2 proteins. Using RNA interference (RNAi), they knocked down the expression of SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro and observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake, reduced transcription of downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity, and a decrease in fecal egg production. In vaccine/challenge experiments, recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in S. japonicum-infected mice. These findings suggest that the insulin pathway plays a crucial role in the growth and development of S. japonicum and that targeting the SjIRs may be an effective strategy for developing a vaccine against schistosomiasis japonica. The study provides further evidence for the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines. The results also support the idea that schistosomes exploit host insulin for growth and development, highlighting the importance of the insulin signaling pathway in these parasites.
Title: Interspecific Hybridization Yields Strategy for South Pacific Filariasis Vector Elimination

    Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a significant cause of disability in the South Pacific, where over 96% of the 1.7 million population is at risk of infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) efforts have reduced LF prevalence, but mosquito vector biology complicates the MDA strategy. In some regions, MDA alone may not be sufficient to attain LF elimination. The primary vector, Aedes polynesiensis, is difficult to control using existing methods. This study demonstrates that interspecific hybridization and introgression result in an A. polynesiensis strain (‘CP’ strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show that CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild-type A. polynesiensis populations. This finding supports the feasibility of a vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts. The strategy involves inundative releases of bi-directionally incompatible males to induce sterility in A. polynesiensis females, resulting in vector population elimination. The South Pacific geography is ideal for this approach, as mosquitoes are an obligate host for W. bancrofti, and anti-vector interventions are recognized as a supplemental method to break the LF transmission cycle.
The study aimed to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Urambo District, Tanzania, in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs. Data from 143 patients admitted to Kaliua Health Centre in 2004 for HAT treatment were analyzed. The direct medical and indirect costs incurred by patients and the health services were calculated, and DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project. The study found that the DALY estimate for HAT in Urambo District was 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) without age-weighting and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1-362.6) with age-weighting. When 45% under-reporting was included, the results were 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3-1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1-1870.8), respectively. The costs of treating 143 patients were estimated at US$ 15,514, with patients paying US$ 3,673 and the health services US$ 11,841. The indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients were estimated at US$ 9,781. The study highlights the significant burden of HAT on affected rural communities in Tanzania and emphasizes the need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates to address the focal nature of the disease in certain areas.
The Ngly1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase that is highly conserved among eukaryotes and plays a critical role in mammals. Mice with a knockout of the Ngly1 gene exhibit severe systemic symptoms and are embryonic lethal in a C57BL/6 background. However, the lethality of Ngly1-deficient mice is partially rescued by the additional deletion of the Engase gene, which encodes another de-N-glycosylating enzyme that leaves a single GlcNAc at glycosylated Asn residues. Furthermore, a change in the genetic background of C57BL/6 mice by crossing with an outbred mouse strain ( ICR ) also partially rescues the embryonic lethality of Ngly1-deficient mice. Viable Ngly1-deficient mice in a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background exhibit a severe phenotype reminiscent of the symptoms of NGLY1-deficiency in human subjects, which is strongly suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase. The defects observed in Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice and Ngly1-deficient mice in a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background closely resemble some of the symptoms of patients with an NGLY1-deficiency. These findings suggest that Ngly1- or Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studying the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency and that cytoplasmic ENGase may be a potential therapeutic target for this genetic disorder.
The study investigated the role of gene expression noise in spatial patterning during Drosophila segmentation, focusing on the hunchback (hb) gene, which is activated by the Bicoid (Bcd) protein gradient. The researchers used a stochastic model of the hb promoter to examine how promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics affect noise amplitude and distribution. The model was fit to data from wild-type (WT) embryos, a self-regulation mutant (hb14F), and lacZ reporter constructs with different portions of the hb promoter. The results showed that WT hb output noise is primarily dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. The study also found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter and their strengths play a role in buffering noise, particularly in the absence of self-regulation. The model was robust to variations in Bcd binding site number across different fly species. The findings suggest that promoter structure and regulatory dynamics, such as self-feedback, multiple regulatory sites, and cooperativity, contribute to the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development. The study provides insights into how noise is controlled in spatial gene expression patterns, which is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. The model can be used to investigate noise generation in the hb expression dynamics, including the relative contributions of binding site number and strength, binding cooperativity, self-regulation, and protein diffusion.
This study investigates the strength of selection against Neanderthal introgression in modern human populations. The authors develop a novel method to estimate the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency in modern humans. The results confirm that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The study finds that the majority of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry acts on many weakly deleterious alleles. These alleles were effectively neutral in Neanderthals but became selected against after entering human populations of larger effective size. This suggests that differences in effective population size may play a more significant role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. The study proposes that the accumulation of weakly deleterious alleles in Neanderthals, which were purged after introgressing into the human population, contributed to the observed patterns of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans. The results have implications for understanding how populations remain distinct after secondary contact and suggest that nearly neutral dynamics and differences in effective population size are important determinants of levels of introgression across species and along the genome. The study enhances our understanding of how selection shaped the genomic contribution of Neanderthal to our genomes and sheds light on the nature of Neanderthal–human hybridization.
The HIV-1 promoter within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) plays a crucial role in regulating viral gene expression and replication. Stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression, amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop, can contribute to the formation of either a productive, transactivated state or an inactive state. In a significant fraction of cells harboring an integrated copy of the HIV-1 model provirus, this bimodal gene expression profile is dynamic, with cells spontaneously switching between active ( Bright ) and inactive ( Off ) expression modes. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κB elements that regulate gene expression via the recruitment of both activating and repressing complexes. Using model lentivirus variants with mutations introduced in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements, researchers employed flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to reveal significant functional differences in contributions of each site to viral gene regulation. The Sp1 sites were found to stabilize both the Bright and the Off states, promoting noisy gene expression and reduction in the regulation of histone acetylation and deacetylation. In contrast, the NF-κB sites exhibit distinct properties, with κB site I serving a stronger activating role than κB site II. Mutations in any of the Sp1 sites yielded a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifurcation compared to that of the wild-type promoter. These results suggest that each Sp1 and NF-κB site differentially contributes to the regulation of viral gene expression, and Sp1 sites functionally “dampen” transcriptional noise and modulate the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency.
Title: Phylogenetic and Functional Assessment of Orthologs Inference Projects and Methods
    Summary: A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of nine leading orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA, as well as two standard methods, bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance. The study involved mapping millions of sequences, handling hundreds of millions of predicted pairs of orthologs, and computing tens of thousands of trees. The results showed that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis with high specificity. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage, OrthoMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent, Inparanoid. EggNOG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories but was not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. The study also found that Ensembl Compara's sophisticated tree reconstruction/reconciliation approach was sometimes outperformed by pairwise comparison approaches, and bidirectional best-hit often outperformed projects with more complex algorithms. The study provides guidance for orthology data users, introduces new methodology for verifying orthology, and sets performance standards for current and future approaches.
The development of novel therapeutics for schistosomiasis is urgently needed due to the emergence of resistance to the current treatment, praziquantel. To address this challenge, a computational drug repurposing pipeline was developed, supported by phenotypic screening. This approach identified several protein kinases as potential new biological targets for schistosomiasis, as they play a crucial role in the parasite's biological processes. The kinomes of Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma haematobium were elucidated, and compared to the human kinome, to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors unique to Schistosoma species. This led to the identification of novel targets and suggested approved drugs that might inhibit them, including bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, and dinaciclib. Additionally, 22 newly identified targets were suggested, including CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1. The primary and secondary targets in Schistosoma of these approved drugs were also suggested, enabling the development of novel therapeutics against schistosomiasis. This study demonstrates the potential of computational drug repurposing and phenotypic screening in identifying new targets and inhibitors for schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease.
The study investigated the folding and binding mechanism of the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. Simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism, with the existence of partially bound intermediates. Transition-path and Φ-value analyses revealed that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, indicating that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This is in contrast to models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. The study found that increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting”-like process. The inclusion of attractive non-native interactions resulted in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. The simulations are in agreement with a recently reported nuclear magnetic resonance study and aid in the interpretation of the experimental binding kinetics. The results suggest that being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition. The study provides new insights into the folding and binding mechanism of the pKID/KIX complex and has implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression.
A systematic review was conducted to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and territories between 1942 and 2014. The review included 132 articles with 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. The majority of the data came from Brazil (69.7%), which showed several 'hot spots' with high prevalence. The results indicate that Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their national programs to target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys are needed to verify this status. The review highlights the need for improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies used in schistosomiasis programs. Meeting the regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex. The review also emphasizes the importance of assessing both prevalence and intensity of infection, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), to control morbidity and eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem.
Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 subtype C is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single viral variant, the transmitted/founder (TF), during most transmission events. To investigate viral characteristics influencing HIV-1 transmission, researchers sequenced 167 near full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IMC) from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs near the time of transmission. The results showed that consensus-like genomes sensitive to donor antibodies were selected for during transmission in these six transmission pairs. However, TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC). Additionally, resistance of the TF variant to the antiviral effects of interferon-α (IFN-α) was not significantly different from that of non-transmitted variants from the same transmission pair. These findings suggest that neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance discriminated the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of these chronically infected individuals. The study supports the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. The results also indicate that factors other than IFN-α resistance are the dominant determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs.
Filarial parasites have been shown to induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling in the absence of an adaptive immune system in murine models. However, severe irreversible lymphedema and elephantiasis appear to require an intact adaptive immune response in human infections. To investigate how filarial parasites directly influence the lymphatics, human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum. The results showed that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Furthermore, serum from patients with patent filarial infections and those with longstanding chronic lymphatic obstruction induced increased LEC proliferation compared to sera from uninfected individuals. The differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their tissue inhibitors. Gene expression analysis revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, leading to decreased trans-endothelial transport. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis. The study demonstrates that filarial proteins stimulate LEC to undergo proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures, involving matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases.
The Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) method enables the amplification of genomic DNA from single cells, eliminating the need for laboratory culture. To improve the efficiency and specificity of MDA, researchers used a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA in 60-nanoliter reactions. The results showed that reducing the reaction volume from microliters to nanoliters significantly lowered nonspecific synthesis caused by contaminant DNA templates and primer interactions. The quality of genome amplification was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and found to be comparable to standard 50-microliter volumes. Furthermore, amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanoliter volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. High-throughput pyrosequencing of single-cell amplicons from both microliter and nanoliter volumes produced high-quality sequence data, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells. This approach has significant implications for the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as it allows for the recovery of whole genome sequences from single cells that cannot be obtained in pure culture. The combination of MDA and emulsion PCR sample preparation may also improve specificity, making it a powerful approach for single-cell sequencing applications. Overall, the use of nanoliter reactors improved the efficiency and specificity of MDA, enabling the generation of high-quality sequence data from single cells.
This study investigated the relationship between hantavirus host assemblages and human disease in the Atlantic Forest of South America. The researchers analyzed 283 rodent capture records and used geographically weighted models to examine the influence of landscape structure on hantavirus host proportions. The results showed that hantavirus host proportions were more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity was also found to positively influence known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, suggesting that a plasticity to habitat quality may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest-dwelling species. In contrast, defaunation intensity did not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes in the community, indicating that non-defaunated areas can also be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks. The spatial match between host hotspots and human disease vulnerability was found to be 17%, while coldspots matched 20%. The study suggests that disease surveillance must be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. The findings also indicate that there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than currently hypothesized. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering landscape diversity and local small mammal diversity in understanding hantavirus host assemblages and human disease in the Atlantic Forest.
Infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), requires the pro-survival BCL2 protein BCLXL for cell survival. BCLXL suppresses the expression of the pro-survival protein MCL1, thereby delaying apoptosis in infected cells. This delay is crucial for viral dissemination to neighboring cells, leading to high pathogenicity. Inhibition of BCLXL, either through treatment with BCLXL inhibitors or deficiency of the BCLXL gene, induces BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in infected cells. Furthermore, impairment of BCLXL accelerates apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, reducing viral dissemination and chemokine production. In vivo, haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene or administration of BH3 mimetic compounds increased survival rates after challenge with JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. The results suggest that BCLXL plays a critical role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress the propagation of Flaviviridae viruses. The study proposes a model in which flavivirus infection reduces MCL1 expression, while BCLXL delays apoptosis, allowing for viral dissemination and high pathogenicity. Inhibition of BCLXL, on the other hand, induces apoptosis and reduces viral dissemination, leading to low pathogenicity in vivo.
This study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005 to 2014. The analysis included direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs, livestock, and humans, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), dog vaccination efforts, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The study found that the total economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam over the 10-year period was over $719 million USD, with PEP-related costs accounting for 92% of the total burden. Canine rabies resulted in between 36,560 and 45,700 DALYs, measured in years of life lost (YLL), and a total of 914 human deaths were reported over the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD. The results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with those reported in other Asian countries, with large expenditures on PEP and minimal investments in dog vaccination. The study suggests that coordinated veterinary public health campaigns that prevent human rabies through dog vaccination are more cost-effective than suppressing disease through PEP administration. The findings highlight the need for increased investment in dog vaccination efforts to reduce the economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam.
The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine responsible for the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key component of the T2SS is the secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Research has identified three distinct forms of T2SSs based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Two of these forms, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, are distinguished by the pilotin that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. A novel pilotin, AspS, has been identified in Vibrio cholerae, which is structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. The crystal structure of AspS reveals that it binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. Homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio, as well as in a few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. The presence of AspS is correlated with the presence of Vibrio-type secretins and AcfD/SslE substrates in diverse bacteria, suggesting that some bacteria have acquired a complete functional unit of secretin-pilotin-substrate incorporated with the rest of the T2SS operon. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that AspS binds to an S-domain sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, with sequence analysis distinguishing the S-domains of the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type secretins. The phylogeny of the Vibrio-type secretins is reflected in the phylogenetic relationships for the AspS sequences.
The OmpL37 surface-exposed protein is expressed by pathogenic Leptospira during infection and has been found to bind to human skin and vascular elastin. The study investigated the functional roles of three transmembrane outer membrane proteins, OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47, which were recently identified on the leptospiral surface. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that OmpL37 exhibits dose-dependent and saturating binding to human skin and aortic elastin, as well as fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding to human skin elastin by both recombinant OmpL37 and live Leptospira interrogans is specifically enhanced by rabbit antiserum for OmpL37, suggesting the involvement of OmpL37 in leptospiral binding to elastin and the possibility that host-generated antibodies may promote rather than inhibit the adherence of leptospires to elastin-rich tissues. OmpL37 is recognized by acute and convalescent leptospirosis patient sera and Leptospira-infected hamster sera, and the protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira. These findings suggest that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may be promoting attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. The study hypothesizes that OmpL37 might be involved in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis, facilitating the attachment of leptospires to an inner elastin-rich layer of the skin exposed by abrasion during the initial stage of infection.
The article presents a model to calculate the probability of polyreactive antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 disabling a gp41 trimer after T cell-HIV adhesion. These antibodies, isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 that are transiently exposed during viral entry. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in a stably bound complex, approximately five minutes or less for 4E10 and 2F5. The study investigates the role of avidity in neutralization and shows that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, attributed to 2F5 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. The model elucidates the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and proposes an extension to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridges between the virus and target cell at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate. Analysis of neutralization experiments indicates that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the model cannot determine the exact number from neutralization experiments alone.
A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic onchocerciasis foci in Mali and Senegal to assess the feasibility of onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment. The study involved 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment, followed by final evaluations up to 5 years after the last treatment. Skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and analyzing 492,600 blackflies for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae. The results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment, with two sites achieving zero microfilaria prevalence and vector infectivity rate 3 to 4 years after treatment cessation. In the third site, where infection levels were initially high, a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels was observed 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. The study established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The study's findings have informed the transition from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa, with nearly all endemic areas under annual ivermectin treatment and control of the disease as a public health problem achieved in most areas.
Human rhinovirus, a common cause of the common cold, is a non-enveloped virus that must deliver its genome across a cell membrane without the aid of membrane fusion. The small myristoylated capsid protein VP4 plays a crucial role in this process, interacting with the cell membrane and facilitating the delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. In this study, recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged human rhinovirus VP4 was produced and shown to induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes. Dextran size-exclusion studies, chemical crosslinking, and electron microscopy revealed that VP4 forms a multimeric membrane pore with a channel size consistent with the transfer of single-stranded RNA. The membrane permeability induced by recombinant VP4 was influenced by pH and was comparable to that induced by infectious virions. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and suggest that VP4 could be a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family. The study demonstrates that VP4 forms a multimeric, size-selective membrane pore, with dimensions consistent with the transport of viral RNA, and provides a model system for further exploration of VP4 as an antiviral target.
Francisella tularensis ( Ft ) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease designated as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The lipid A structure of Ft is similar to that of Francisella novicida ( Fn ), a pathogen of mice. Researchers identified three enzymes required for Fn lipid A carbohydrate modifications : flmF1, flmF2, and flmK. Mutants lacking galactosamine ( flmF2 ) or galactosamine/mannose ( flmK ) addition to their lipid A were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of the mutants ( flmF2 and flmK ) provided protection against challenge with wild-type ( WT ) Fn, while subcutaneous administration of only the flmK mutant provided protection from challenge with WT Fn. Infection of an alveolar macrophage cell line by the flmK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 ( MIP-2 ) compared to infection with WT Fn. Bone marrow–derived macrophages ( BMMø ) from Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) and TLR2/4 knockout mice infected with the flmK mutant produced significantly higher amounts of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and MIP-2 than BMMø infected with WT Fn. However, production of IL-6 and MIP-2 was undetectable in BMMø from MyD88−/− mice infected with either strain. The researchers hypothesize that the ability of the flmK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune responses mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway may be responsible for its attenuation, leading to the induction of protective immunity by this mutant.
The (p)ppGpp-binding GTPase Era promotes rRNA processing and cold adaptation in Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a ribosome-associated GTPase that acts as a molecular switch to coordinate ribosome assembly. In Staphylococcus aureus, Era is not essential for growth but is important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Protein interaction studies reveal that Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA. Both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. Era and CshA also form direct interactions with the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelSau, with RelSau positively impacting the GTPase activity of Era but negatively affecting the helicase activity of CshA. In its GTP-bound form, Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome to direct enzymes involved in rRNA processing/degradation and ribosome subunit assembly to their site of action. This activity is impeded by multiple components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype synonymous with this stress response pathway. The stringent response can also impact RA-GTPase function through direct interactions of RelSau with both Era and CshA. These interactions suggest that Era acts as a guide for rRNA/ribosome maturation enzymes to their substrates, promoting rRNA processing and cold adaptation in Staphylococcus aureus.
The study investigated the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in mediating cardiac damage. Mice deficient in nNOS (nNOS−/−) were found to be more susceptible to LT-induced mortality compared to wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient in other nitric oxide synthases (iNOS and eNOS). The increased sensitivity of nNOS−/− mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin and cytokine responses. Histopathological analyses revealed that LT induced architectural changes in the hearts of nNOS−/− mice, including novel inter-fiber spaces, endothelial necrosis, and inter-myocyte edema. Electron microscopic analyses showed similar pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS−/− and WT mice, with varying severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury, such as myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein, were elevated in LT-treated mice as early as 6 hours after toxin injection. Echocardiography indicated a reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS−/− and WT mice, suggesting decreased contractile function in the heart. The study suggests that the heart is an early target of LT in mice and that nNOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage. The results also indicate that nitric oxide scavenging may be a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate cardiac damage caused by LT.
Scientists have developed a method for introducing targeted gene disruptions in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool. This breakthrough enables the study of gene function in parasitic nematodes, which are responsible for some of the most common neglected tropical diseases affecting over 1 billion people worldwide. The researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the S. stercoralis twitchin gene unc-22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. The mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a repair template was provided, and deletions occurred when the template was omitted. The Ss-unc-22 mutations were heritable, allowing the researchers to pass the mutant nematodes through a host and recover mutant progeny. A similar approach was used to disrupt the unc-22 gene in the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti. The study demonstrates the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to parasitic nematodes, paving the way for future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites. This achievement provides a valuable tool for understanding the biology of parasitic nematodes and may lead to the development of new treatments for diseases caused by these parasites.
A novel mathematical model has been developed to describe the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rate and polysome profile during protein synthesis. Ribosome drop-off is a well-established phenomenon that plays a crucial role in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses. The model predicts that ribosome premature termination can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as an increase in ribosome density from the 5’ to the 3’ end of the mRNA. Importantly, the model reveals that the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rate are mRNA-specific, with mRNAs that present ribosome queues being less affected by drop-off than those that do not. Furthermore, among mRNAs without ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with elongation rate, suggesting that sequences using fast codons are less affected by ribosome drop-off. A genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirms these predictions, showing that mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off under favourable growth conditions. In contrast, mRNAs coding for regulatory and stress-related proteins are less resilient to ribosome drop-off under physiological conditions. The model provides a framework for analyzing variations in translational efficiency of individual mRNAs and explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies. The results highlight the importance of accounting for ribosome drop-off in modeling and interpreting ribosome profiling data to accurately estimate translation rates.
The World Health Organization’s current strategy for addressing soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children involves routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children to control morbidity. However, this approach may not be sufficient to interrupt transmission due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. To accelerate transmission interruption, alternative strategies of mass drug administration (MDA) are being explored. The DeWorm3 trial aims to investigate the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using MDA. The trial involves three years of high treatment coverage followed by two years of surveillance to assess whether transmission interruption has occurred. However, determining whether transmission interruption is unlikely at earlier timepoints would be beneficial to reduce continuous monitoring efforts in settings where interruption is unlikely and to avoid bounce-back to pre-treatment levels. A stochastic, individual-based simulation model was employed to simulate the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial. The analysis suggests that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. The results indicate that a tight range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters does not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.
A conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholerae O1 (Ogawa) O-Specific Polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc) was evaluated in mice. The study aimed to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with OSP:TThc or OSP alone, with or without dmLT, a non-toxigenic immunoadjuvant derived from heat labile toxin of Escherichia coli. The results showed significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP following a single immunization in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS IgG responses were detected following a second immunization in these cohorts. In contrast, no anti-OSP or anti-LPS IgG responses were detected in mice receiving un-conjugated OSP with or without immunoadjuvant, or in mice receiving immunoadjuvant alone. Serum anti-OSP IgM responses were detected in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without immunoadjuvant, and in mice receiving unconjugated OSP. Administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant also induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. The study demonstrates that the cholera conjugate vaccine is protectively immunogenic and induces anti-OSP memory B cell responses in mice, suggesting its potential to induce long-term protective immunity, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
In a study using a neutropenic mouse model of microbial gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination, Candida albicans was found to inhibit the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the expression of P. aeruginosa pyochelin and pyoverdine genes. These genes play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence in P. aeruginosa. Deletion of both pyochelin and pyoverdine genes in P. aeruginosa attenuated its virulence. Candida albicans secreted proteins directly suppressed P. aeruginosa pyoverdine and pyochelin expression and inhibited P. aeruginosa virulence in mice. Heat-killed Candida albicans had no effect on P. aeruginosa. Oral iron supplementation restored P. aeruginosa virulence in mice colonized by both Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa. Candida albicans secreted proteins inhibited P. aeruginosa-mediated cytotoxic effects against cultured human colonocytes and significantly reduced P. aeruginosa virulence. The findings suggest that Candida albicans can modulate Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence in the intestine through the suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression. This novel observation highlights the complexities of polymicrobial, polykingdom infections and identifies a potential therapeutic target for preventing microbial disease. Candida albicans secreted proteins were sufficient to inhibit P. aeruginosa pyochelin and pyoverdine gene expression and decrease P. aeruginosa’s cytotoxic effect on colonocytes in vitro. Oral administration of Candida albicans secreted proteins protected mice from P. aeruginosa infection. Oral iron supplementation restored P. aeruginosa virulence in mice colonized by both Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa.
Biomedical research has shown that escape mutant (EM) viruses, which evade CD8+ T cell recognition, are frequently observed following infection with HIV-1 or SIV. These EM viruses are often less replicatively fit compared to wild-type (WT) viruses, as demonstrated by reversion to WT upon transmission to a naïve host and association with lower viral loads in vivo. However, the rate and timing of reversion is highly variable. A study investigated the reversion to WT of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT virus in pigtail macaques using a sensitive PCR assay. The results showed that infection with mixes of EM and WT virus containing ≥10% WT virus results in immediate and rapid outgrowth of WT virus at SIV Gag CD8 T cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, infection with biologically passaged SHIVmn229 viruses with much smaller proportions of WT sequence, or a molecular clone of pure EM SIVmac239, demonstrated a delayed or slow pattern of reversion. The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations in some scenarios suggests opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during very early infection.
In a study of yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon, Israel, researchers found that a subset of diploid yeast strains exhibited an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. The cadmium resistance was primarily caused by an enhanced function of the metal efflux pump PCA1, which is encoded by the PCA1 gene. Molecular analyses revealed that mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence were responsible for the enhancement, while mutations in the coding region had a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments showed that three single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter increased its activity and thus enhanced cadmium resistance. The critical nucleotides found in the EC strains were conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other yeast species, suggesting that they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides had diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave cells growth advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. The study provides a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. The findings suggest that the reduced cadmium resistance in most S. cerevisiae populations is likely due to regulatory fine-tuning that allows cells to maintain a certain level of cadmium efflux activity without compromising their fitness under normal conditions.
The study aimed to identify major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer (GC) with significant relationships to patient survival. Using gene expression signatures, the researchers devised an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. Three oncogenic pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin) were found to be deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric cancers. These findings were functionally validated in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions may play an important role in influencing disease behavior. The study demonstrated that individual GCs can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. The researchers developed an in silico method to map activation levels of different pathways in cohorts of complex primary tumor profiles and validated this pathway-directed classification approach using proof-of-concept examples from breast cancer. This method was then applied to GC to evaluate eleven oncogenic pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis. The results suggest that predicting pathway activity by expression signatures permits the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, at a scale not currently achievable by other platforms. Gastric cancer, the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, is a molecularly heterogeneous disease with deregulation of canonical oncogenic pathways such as E2F, K-RAS, p53, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurring with varying frequencies.
The study investigated the relationship between stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) and regulatory regions of stress response genes in Escherichia coli K12. Using SIDD analysis, the researchers found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions containing promoters, but rarely in coding regions. They then examined the SIDD properties of genes grouped in different functional categories and found that strong SIDD sites are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators. In particular, the upstream regions of genes that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those of genes not involved in these responses. Furthermore, if a pathway is controlled by a transcriptional regulator whose gene has a destabilized 5′ flank, the genes (operons) in that pathway also usually contain strongly destabilized SIDD sites in their 5′ flanks. This association was observed in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria. The results suggest that strong SIDD sites 5′ to participating genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, which are known to transiently alter superhelicity. The study proposes that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
In the filamentous ascomycete Podospora anserina, a network of high-mobility group ( HMG )-box transcription factors plays a crucial role in regulating the sexual cycle. Systematic deletion analysis of the 12 HMG-box genes in P. anserina revealed that 11 out of 12 genes are involved in the sexual cycle. PaHMG5, an ortholog of SpSte11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes in P. anserina. PaHMG9 is a repressor of several phenomena specific to the stationary phase, including hyphal anastomoses. Transcriptional analyses of HMG-box genes in HMG-box deletion strains indicated that PaHMG5 is at the hub of a network of several HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. This network also controls fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. PaHMG5 and SpSte11 are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes, although P. anserina and S. pombe diverged 550 million years ago. The P. anserina and S. pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor form a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module, revealing a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi. The study provides new insights into the role and relationships of HMG-box genes in P. anserina and highlights the critical role of HMG-box members in sexual reproduction in fungi.
During the 2013–2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, there was a pressing need to determine the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors’ body fluids and the potential risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. An observational cohort study was conducted in Sierra Leone to investigate the presence of Ebola virus in semen and other body fluids of EVD survivors. The study was initiated within five months of initial protocol discussions and consisted of two phases. The first phase assessed the persistence of Ebola virus in semen of 100 adult men, while the second phase evaluated the persistence of virus in multiple body fluids (semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears) of 120 men and 120 women. The study demonstrated the need to implement semen testing programs among EVD survivors and informed national and global guidelines in real-time. Strong community engagement facilitated the rapid implementation of the study during the epidemic. However, challenges were encountered, including unforeseen duration of follow-up, complexity of interpreting and communicating laboratory results to survivors, and the urgency of translating research findings into public health practice. The study tools and lessons learned accelerated the implementation of semen testing programs in EVD-affected countries and informed studies examining the persistence of Zika virus. The study highlights the importance of research in the public health response to an epidemic of a poorly characterized disease, emphasizing the need for adequate resources to be rapidly made available to answer critical research questions.
The article presents a study on predicting the chemical environments of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, based on their chemotaxis sensory system. The researchers used in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and information theory to analyze the dose-response curves of the chemotactic sensory pathway. They found that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient (chemotactic index) and hence the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient. The study suggests that chemotactic E. coli typically encounters exponential gradients in its natural habitat, as its pathway has evolved to maintain perception in these conditions. The researchers also reevaluated the phenomenological Weber's law and its generalizations to the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection (FCD) to predict the average gradients cells experience. They used information theory and simulations to obtain full distributions of gradients, considering limitations of information transmission from both cell-external and internal noise. The results indicate broad distributions of exponential gradients, leading to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. This study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The findings connect a large number of phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, shedding light on the design principles of sensory systems.
The lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for the long-term supply of blood cells, was previously thought to be indefinite due to their self-renewal capacity. However, recent evidence suggests that genetically identical HSCs within the same animal can differ in lifespan, indicating that lifespan is predetermined and HSC-intrinsic. A new model based on reliability theory was developed to account for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs. Using clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling, the study found that the repopulation failure kinetics of each HSC are largely anti-persistent, or mean-reverting, processes. This means that failure rates repeatedly increase during population-wide division events and are counteracted and decreased by repair processes. However, in the long-run, a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior occurs, leading to rapid clonal extinction due to a slow increase in the mean failure rate of self-renewal. The study also found that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics, with shorter and longer lived HSCs differing significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. The findings suggest that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by preprogrammed differences in repair capacity. The study's results have implications for understanding aging in HSCs and other non-homogenous, hierarchically organized cell systems.
Antibodies play a crucial role in providing protective immunity against chronic helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multicellular parasites have remained unclear. This study investigated the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity following challenge infection with the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp). The results show that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue-migrating larvae and prevent tissue necrosis. Mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage, and accumulated fewer Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. Antibodies together with helminth larvae reprogrammed macrophages to express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, and the Arginase-1 product L-ornithine directly impaired larval motility. Notably, antibody-induced expression of Arginase-1 occurred independently of IL-4Rα signaling, indicating a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation. This mechanism, referred to as helminth-antibody activated macrophages (HAAM), mediates anti-helminth immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae. The study demonstrates a novel effector function of antibodies in activating macrophages to modulate the expression of genes associated with the alternatively activated phenotype, providing new insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against helminths.
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a significant threat to genome integrity and cell survival. Cells respond to DSBs by initiating repair programs that involve enzymatic DNA restoration, chromatin remodeling, and checkpoint activation. The exposed DNA ends are initially protected by the Ku70-Ku80 complex (Ku complex) until a repair pathway is chosen and corresponding proteins are recruited. Homologous recombination (HR) is the most accurate method for repairing DSBs, involving the use of an intact copy of the broken locus as a template. However, the early steps of HR, including resection from DSB ends that generates recombinogenic single strands, have been difficult to visualize due to the need for a non-intrusive method that does not interfere with the process.

A new visualization tool, the ParB-INT system, has been developed to address this challenge. This system uses protein oligomerization rather than operator multiplicity to form visible foci, allowing for real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. By applying this tool to the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, researchers have provided the first real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. The results show that resection in a yku70 mutant begins approximately 10 minutes earlier than in wild-type cells, defining this as the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. The study also reveals a transient confinement of the damaged chromatin region during the early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. The ParB-INT system has the potential to be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics, and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Epidemiological modeling of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was conducted to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and assess the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. A stochastic agent-based model was implemented to fit epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reached 56% in humans. The model predicted an annual reinfection rate of 0. 032 ( 0. 008–0. 042 ) per individual, with 98. 4% of reinfections occurring in the chronic phase. The parasite was found to evade the adaptive immune response in at least 20% of re-inoculation events. As a result, the risks of reinfection during the chronic stage of the disease were estimated to be around 14% ( 4%–18% ) and 60% ( 21%–70% ) after 5 and 30 years, respectively, with most individuals being re-infected 1–3 times overall. The low rates of reinfection were attributed to the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission rather than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. These estimates have implications for vaccine development and understanding the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations in infected individuals living in endemic areas. The study highlights the importance of mathematical and computational models in inferring the rate and timing of T. cruzi reinfections from epidemiological field data.
Dengue virus (DENV) infections can result in a range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic or subclinical infection to severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). A study investigated the relationship between pre-existing immune responses and the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection in a cohort of school-aged Thai children. Blood samples were collected from the children before and after the peak DENV transmission season, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with DENV to measure the secretion of 30 cytokines. The results showed significant differences in cytokine production based on the type of DENV used for stimulation and the occurrence of clinical illness. Specifically, higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 were found in PBMC from subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection, while IL-6 was produced by PBMC from all subjects who subsequently developed symptomatic infection, but only 59% of subjects with subclinical infection. In contrast, lower levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were found in PBMC from subjects with symptomatic infection. These findings suggest the existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles associated with the clinical outcome of DENV infection. The study's results may have implications for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines and understanding the mechanisms controlling differential clinical outcomes in DENV infections.
In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, the Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning along the anterior–posterior axis. While Hh is traditionally viewed as a classical morphogen that regulates gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner, a direct correspondence between Hh concentration thresholds and the borders of gene expression patterns has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and proposes that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, the authors predict that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial “overshoot” of the Hh gradient occurs, which is a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. This overshoot is thought to result from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched ( Ptc ), and is required to distinguish different spatial domains of gene expression in response to Hh. The authors propose a new model of pattern formation that takes into consideration gradient dynamics to explain Hh-dependent patterning of the wing disc. This model suggests that the Hh gene network architecture plays an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression.
The article describes the positional cloning and characterization of a new mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), isolated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. The Lwt allele disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) unc-79 gene. While Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, Lightweight heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lightweight heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. In addition, Lightweight heterozygotes are mildly hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment, are smaller than wild-type animals, exhibit increased food consumption, and have a leaner body composition. Notably, Lightweight heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lightweight heterozygous mice, in combination with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants, suggests a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
The Anopheles gambiae immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of human malaria, has been identified as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to control malaria transmission. The Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, has been shown to have potent anti-P. falciparum activity. Silencing the expression of caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or over-expressing rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NF-kappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes. To further explore this mechanism, the authors used RNA interference to singly or dually silence caspar and other components of the Imd pathway, identifying genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar. These genes, including TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1, represent potential targets to achieve over-activation of the pathway. The Imd pathway was found to be most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. Caspar silencing alone was sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. The study highlights the physiological considerations integral to implementing Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae to limit malaria transmission and reveals nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum.
The study investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) in a mouse model of pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. BMMSCs have been considered a promising therapy for fibrotic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, BMMSCs were isolated and purified from BALB/c mice and administered intravenously to mice infected with P. brasiliensis at 8 weeks post-infection. The results showed that BMMSCs treatment did not have an anti-fibrotic effect, but rather exacerbated pulmonary fibrosis. Histopathological examination revealed an increase in granulomatous inflammatory areas and fibrocytes count in BMMSCs-treated mice. Additionally, soluble collagen and fibrosis-related genes expression, such as collagen-3α1, TGF-β3, MMP-8, and MMP-15, were significantly increased in BMMSCs-treated mice. Furthermore, human fibroblasts stimulated with homogenized lung supernatants from infected and BMMSCs-transplanted mice showed a higher expression of collagen I. In contrast, the combined therapy of BMMSCs and itraconazole (ITC) reduced the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-13 genes and decreased the amount of soluble collagen in the lungs. These findings suggest that BMMSCs may not be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by P. brasiliensis infection, and that their interaction with the fungus may promote collagen expression and tissue remodeling.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotomine sand fly species that are proven vectors of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean subregion. The study aimed to provide a baseline for future investigations on sand fly population dynamics that may impact leishmaniasis transmission due to ongoing climate changes. A consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries conducted entomological investigations in sites where L. infantum transmission was recently reported from 2011 to 2013. The study analyzed data from 99,000 collected specimens, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to six L. infantum vector species.

The study found that the time of sand fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, which ranged from early April to the first half of June, and the type of density trend, varying from a single peak in July/August to multiple peaks increasing in magnitude from May through September. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve, with a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period, and falling between early May to late October for more than 99% of values.

The study also found a common pattern of nocturnal females' activity, whose density peaked between 11 pm and 2 am, and identified a higher potential risk for L. infantum transmission in the June-October period (97% relative vector density). However, the risk was not equally distributed throughout the region, with density waves of adults occurring earlier and more frequently in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, has been found to replicate in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Microarray analysis revealed that O. tsutsugamushi altered the expression of over 4, 500 genes in monocytes, including the upregulation of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages. The bacterium also induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. Live O. tsutsugamushi organisms were necessary for the type I interferon response and apoptosis, and enhanced the expression of M1-associated cytokines. These findings were related to the transcriptional changes detected in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus, who showed upregulation of 613 genes, including interferon-related genes, and features of M1 polarization. The study demonstrates that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to O. tsutsugamushi, and highlights the role of interferon-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype in the pathogenesis of scrub typhus. The results suggest that O. tsutsugamushi induces a specific M1 phenotype and stimulates a type I IFN response in monocytes, which may be associated with the inflammatory complications of scrub typhus. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of scrub typhus and may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for the disease.
A spiking neural model originally developed to describe olfactory association in fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster) has been adapted to account for the ability of desert ants (Cataglyphis velox) to rapidly learn visual routes through complex natural environments. The model, which simulates the neural architecture of the insect mushroom body (MB), demonstrates that it can learn to distinguish between on-route and off-route images in a realistic visual learning task. The MB has been extensively studied in the context of olfactory associative learning, but its role in visual learning has not been well understood. The model used three stages of processing, with olfactory inputs producing a spatio-temporal pattern in the antennal lobe, consistent with evidence in flies and other insects. The simulation showed that the MB can learn over 80 on-route images, reconstructed from real ant viewpoints in their natural habitat, and reliably distinguish them from highly similar images obtained when looking off-route. The network required almost no modification to perform the complex function of supporting navigation under realistic conditions, despite being originally developed for simple olfactory associative learning in flies. The study suggests that the neural architecture of the ant MB could plausibly form the substrate for the familiarity algorithm of Baddeley et al. The theoretical storage capacity of the ant MB has been estimated at hundreds of independent images, based on the key computational principles of the circuit, including one-shot learning of sparse codes.
Plants have evolved unique defense mechanisms to protect themselves from disease, including the ability to replace damaged organs through their flexible developmental program. In Arabidopsis, cauline leaves infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae undergo abscission, or shedding, as a defense mechanism. The abscission response is triggered by the pathogen's type III secretion system and requires the HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED genes. Additionally, phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, salicylic acid induction-deficient 2, and senescence-associated gene 101 plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling fail to abscise cauline leaves normally. Bacteria that physically contact the abscission zone trigger a strong abscission response, while long-distance signals are also sent from distal infected tissue to the abscission zone. A threshold model regulating cauline leaf defense is proposed, where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, cauline leaves are shed. Salicylic acid is found to regulate both pathogen- and drought-triggered leaf abscission. The study defines a new model system for studying pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis and begins to explain the genetics governing this process. The abscission pathway is required for all known forms of inducible leaf abscission in Arabidopsis, and salicylic acid production or signaling is necessary for proper pathogen-triggered leaf abscission to occur.
Retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a crucial role in detecting image motion direction in the retina. To investigate the mechanisms underlying direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites, researchers used somatic whole-cell recordings and Fourier analysis to measure electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli. The results showed that SACs generate larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. This direction selectivity persists even in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonic frequency components indicates nonlinearity, which is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. Compartmental modeling suggests that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination. Optical recordings of visual stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals also showed that dendritic sectors can be activated independently, with the strongest [Ca2+] increases in the distal portions of the dendrites, near the output synapses. These findings indicate that SAC dendrites can generate DS signals independently of lateral inhibitory interactions, relying on intrinsic mechanisms involving voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient.
The mechanisms of pathogenesis, infective dose, and virulence in human parasites were investigated in a study that analyzed data from 43 different human pathogens across various taxonomic groups. Contrary to the hypothesis that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators are more virulent, the study found no significant relationship between case fatality rate or severity of infection and the mechanism of pathogenesis. However, a significant negative correlation was observed between infective dose and case fatality rate, indicating that pathogens with lower infective doses are associated with higher case fatality rates. The study also found that pathogens infecting hosts through wounded skin result in significantly higher case fatality rates compared to those inhaled or ingested. Furthermore, the results showed that pathogens using locally acting molecules have lower infective doses than those using distantly acting molecules, but are not less virulent. The study highlights the importance of mechanistic details in understanding the variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence. The findings suggest that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain the variation in these traits, and that the mode of transmission and route of infection also play a significant role in determining infective dose and virulence. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and the factors that influence the virulence of human parasites.
This study investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic helminth that causes schistosomiasis. The researchers used a novel bioinformatics tool, Sylamer, to analyze the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of transcripts differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages of the parasite. They found that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence was significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. A novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, was identified, and its genomic location suggested that it forms a miRNA cluster with sma-miR-277. The expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs was found to be up-regulated in adults, while their predicted targets were down-regulated in paired adult worms but remained unchanged in immature females. Additionally, sma-miR-4989 was expressed in tegumental cells near the oesophagus gland and throughout the male worms' body. The results suggest that sma-miR-277/4989 may play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and are involved in the sexual development of female schistosomes. The study provides evidence for the role of miRNAs in the intra-mammalian development of S. mansoni and highlights the importance of miR-277/4989 in regulating gene expression changes underlying the development of juveniles and sexual maturation.
A 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) in a cave inhabited by horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China, has revealed a rich gene pool of SARSr-CoVs with high genetic diversity in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with previous findings, show that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. Additionally, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared to those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases. The findings suggest that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.
The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is a widely used method for detecting drug resistance in human soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. However, recent evidence suggests that density-dependent fecundity may impact the accuracy of FECRT data. Density-dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon where the reproductive output of female worms increases as their population density decreases. This phenomenon has been observed in canine hookworms and is likely to occur in human STHs as well. The relaxation of density-dependent constraints on egg production after drug treatment may lead to an increase in egg output from surviving worms, resulting in an underestimation of drug efficacy. The degree of underestimation will depend on the extent to which egg output is constrained prior to treatment and the ability of worms to increase their egg output. This may lead to varying effects on drug efficacy measurements within a group of potential FECRT candidates. To improve the measurement of relative drug efficacy, it is suggested to omit cases with the heaviest infections from FECRTs, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density-dependent constraints. The potential impact of worm reproductive biology on the utility of FECRT as a resistance detection tool highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods that examine direct drug effects on isolated worms or changes in worm genotypes.
This study investigated the role of epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling during lung development. The researchers found that deletion of HS synthetase Ext1 in epithelial cells resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number in the lung. This was associated with increased FGF10 expression and FGF signaling activity, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Further analysis revealed reduced SHH signaling activity in mutant lungs, which was not due to decreased SHH expression or protein stability, but rather reduced production of biologically active SHH proteins. The study also showed that reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling. These findings highlight the critical role of epithelial HS in maintaining SHH signaling activity and lung morphogenesis. The results suggest that HS produced by epithelial cells is essential for regulating the SHH-FGF10 signaling cascade, which is crucial for proper lung development. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung branching morphogenesis and identifies HS as a key player in this process. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of epithelial HS in regulating SHH signaling and lung development.
The article evaluates the effectiveness of paired-end sequencing strategies for detecting genome rearrangements in cancer. Paired-end sequencing is a technique that assesses genome rearrangements and structural variation on a genome-wide scale, particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations. The authors derive a formula for the probability that a fusion gene exists in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from this genome. They use this formula to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples and find that they can accurately predict fusion genes with a relatively small number of fragments of large size. The authors also demonstrate how the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths and evaluate how different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint localization, and fusion gene detection, even in the presence of errors that suggest false rearrangements. The results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies. The study highlights the importance of maximizing the probability of detecting fusion genes with the least amount of sequencing, taking into account factors such as the number and length of end-sequenced clones, the length of genes that are fused, and possible errors in breakpoint localization.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense the direction of chemical gradients and respond by polarizing and migrating toward attractants, involves the coordinated action of separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. A mathematical model has been developed to recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells by implementing these processes in terms of reaction-diffusion equations. The model consists of three modules: an excitable network that accounts for random migration, a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases the direction of excitability in response to uniform stimuli and gradients, and a polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton that allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and cells in gradients to acquire distinct sensitivity between front and back. Simulations using a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework demonstrate the migration and accompanying changes in cellular morphology. The model is able to recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells, including the ability to respond to combinations of uniform stimuli and gradients, and the acquisition of distinct sensitivity between front and back in cells in gradients. By varying the strengths of various feedback loops in the model, cellular behaviors that mirror those of genetically altered cell lines can be obtained. The results suggest that adaptation is not absolutely required for chemotaxis, and that the model can capture the complex biphasic responses observed in cells without an adaptation mechanism.
TDRD6 (Tudor containing protein 6) is a male germ line-specific protein essential for the structure of chromatoid bodies (ChBs), elongated spermatid development, and male fertility. In meiotic prophase I spermatocytes, TDRD6 interacts with PRMT5, a protein arginine methyl transferase that supports splicing. TDRD6 also associates with SmB, a spliceosomal core protein, in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. In TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes, PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are significantly reduced. As a result, the assembly of spliceosomes is impaired, featuring 3.5-fold increased levels of U5 snRNPs. In the nucleus, these deficiencies in spliceosome maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant usage of introns and exons, as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. These findings demonstrate a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. The study suggests that TDRD6 plays a central role in the regulation of spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing during spermatogenesis.
Title: A Bayesian Model of Acquisition and Clearance of Bacterial Colonization Incorporating Within-Host Variation

A Bayesian model has been developed to estimate the rates of acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization in a host. The model provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing for the determination of bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Unlike previous approaches, this model does not rely on a fixed genetic distance threshold to determine the relationship between isolates. Instead, it uses a fully probabilistic approach that automatically provides uncertainty estimates for all relevant quantities.

The model is based on population genetic simulation and uses a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference. It has been validated through simulations and applied to a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a longitudinal clinical study.

The study of colonization dynamics is critical for understanding host health, as colonizing bacteria can serve as a reservoir for transmission to other hosts and can give rise to invasive strains. Whole-genome sequencing has provided a detailed measure of genetic distance between isolates, which can be used to infer the relationship between them. However, previous approaches have been inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates. The new Bayesian model addresses these limitations and provides a robust and accurate method for determining bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in highly ordered patterns via phyllotaxis. The active transport of the plant hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that cellular hormone transporters of the PIN family create local auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. However, different concepts have been proposed to explain how auxin transporters create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant. The canalization hypothesis suggests that auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which could be initiated by local diffusion. For the shoot apical meristem, a second hypothesis proposes that hormone is systematically transported towards areas with the highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN allocation in the membrane. To test these hypotheses, computational modelling was used to simulate auxin transport at the shoot meristem. The results show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Auxin is transported throughout the plant by carriers at the cell plasma membranes, creating fluxes that lead to local hormone maxima and minima. At the shoot apical meristem, auxin importers and exporters are mainly expressed at the meristem surface. The flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant.
The search for diagnostic biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has been enhanced by the availability of high-quality sequenced genomes and bioinformatic tools. To develop improved point-of-care diagnostic tests, researchers combined wet lab experiments with in silico searches. Immunoblots revealed L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients, and mass spectrometry (MS) was used to confidently identify these antigens. In silico algorithms were employed to search for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes from shortlisted proteins were screened in peptide arrays, and the most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and non-endemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera. Over 90% of the proteins identified from immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from downstream epitope mapping. The most reactive peptide identified had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 60-97%) for IgG1 with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes, and none of the NEHC sera were positive. This study demonstrates the potential of in silico searches to reduce the output of wet lab experiments, focusing on promising candidates containing selected protein features. By predicting epitopes in silico, the researchers screened a large number of peptides using arrays, identifying the most promising one, which showed promising results of both sensitivity and specificity on a small sample size. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.
A large multiregional cohort of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran was reviewed to investigate the incidence of caseating granulomas, a characteristic typically associated with mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis (TB). The study found that 195 (61.5%) of the cases exhibited granulomas, with 49 (25.2%) being caseating, 9 (4.6%) suppurative, and 137 (70.2%) tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating and tuberculoid granuloma groups were significantly different in terms of geographical source, with more cases harboring caseating granulomas in Saudi Arabia (p<0.0001). Histologically, both groups differed in the distribution of their Ridley's pattern (RP), with a doubling RP3 in caseating granulomas (31% vs. 15%) and a doubling of RP5 in tuberculoma group (38% vs. 19%). The time needed to achieve healing (RP5) was shorter in the tuberculoid group (4.0 vs. 6.2 months). The study found no association between granuloma type and parasitic index, CL species, or other variables. The results suggest that CL should be considered part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, particularly in areas where TB is also prevalent. The study also found that cases of CL with caseating granulomas showed a slower healing process, with no association with specific species, which may be due to a worse host immune response or more aggressive Leishmania strains.
Positional cloning of the zinc finger domain transcription factor Zfp69 has identified it as a candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of the mouse QTL Nidd/SJL, which aggravates and accelerates obesity-associated diabetes in the NZO strain. A critical interval on distal chromosome 4 was identified by interval-specific congenic introgression of SJL into diabetes-resistant C57BL/6J mice, and subsequent reporter cross with NZO mice. Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp69, with a retrotransposon (IAPLTR1a) disrupting the gene in NZO and C57BL/6J mice, resulting in a truncated mRNA lacking the coding sequence for the KRAB and Znf-C2H2 domains. In contrast, the diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. When combined with the B6.V-Lepob background, the diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the human orthologue of Zfp69, ZNF642, were significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL, and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains. Expression of the transcription factor in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
The article proposes an integrated model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling T helper (Th) cell differentiation. The model accounts for the core control of Th cell differentiation and is based on a logical formalism due to the qualitative nature of most available data. The authors use an original model reduction approach and a stable state identification algorithm to cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network. To assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, the authors perform systematic simulations considering various prototypic environments. The model predicts the existence of stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, as well as transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. The logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. The model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico. The authors note that previous models of Th cell differentiation assume cross-inhibiting master transcription factors to generate canonical Th subtypes, thereby precluding cell plasticity. In contrast, the proposed model allows for the prediction of alternative cell differentiation pathways arising from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks.
The study presents a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to investigate the mechanisms controlling genome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding during early Drosophila development. The model evaluates the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone achieve a correlation of ∼0. 4 with experimental measurements of in vivo binding. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among the five factors, and accounting for spatial patterning by modeling binding in every nucleus independently, has little effect on prediction accuracy. However, incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into the model dramatically improves predictions to a correlation of 0. 6–0. 9 for various factors across known target genes. The results show that in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions. The study suggests that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding may be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision. The model is applied to predict the genome-wide binding across 4, 251 genes for which gene expression data is available, and a strong relation is found between the model's ability to accurately predict the binding landscape of transcription factors and gene expression levels.
In Drosophila imaginal discs, the basic helix-loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors Daughterless ( Da ) and Extramacrochaetae ( Emc ) play a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression. Specifically, Emc controls the G2/M transition and subsequent cell proliferation through the transcriptional regulation of the cdc25 phosphatase string. This regulatory activity is mediated by the interaction between Emc and Da, where Emc downregulates Da to trigger mitosis. The ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string, indicating that Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation in Drosophila imaginal discs and highlight the importance of Emc and Da in controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation. The study demonstrates that the interaction between Emc and Da is essential for regulating the G2/M transition and cell cycle progression in epithelial cells of the imaginal discs. This regulatory mechanism is conserved in eukaryotic cells and has implications for understanding the development processes that occur in both physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer.
The study presents a comprehensive pipeline for systematic discovery of signaling networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using interventional phosphoproteome data. The pipeline combines phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery to identify key proteins involved in specific pathways and infer signaling networks. To address the limitations of phosphoproteomics, such as sampling limitations and missing data, the authors propose a customized analysis pipeline that partially compensates for these issues. The dataset used for this study was generated using SILAC ( Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture ) technique with interventional experiments ( kinase-dead mutations ). The analysis identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, all of which are involved in stress responses. Nine of these proteins have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. Four predicted proteins ( Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p, and Rcn2p ) were validated by interventional phenotypic experiments, showing differential invasive growth. The study demonstrates that interventional phosphoproteome studies can provide new insights into signaling pathways involved in biological processes such as yeast filamentous growth. The proposed pipeline can be applied to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms, suggesting candidate proteins for further investigation.
The regulation of the Drosophila X chromosome in the male germline has been a topic of interest in understanding the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. The study aimed to investigate how the X chromosome is regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline, specifically examining dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). The results show that X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline, contradicting previous reports. Additionally, microarray analysis found no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. The study also confirmed that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes, but this difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of the Drosophila X chromosome in the male germline and highlights the complexity of sex chromosome regulation in this species.
The study investigates the early stages of Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice, a model for human enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infections. The research reveals that the development of colonic C. rodentium attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions, which determine the severity of infection, is critically dependent on early bacteria-host interactions. These lesions originate from a limited number of single-bacterial epithelial infection events that occur within the first 18 hours of infection. The study shows that the initiation of colonic C. rodentium microcolonies is restricted to an early stage of infection, and these early-established, clonally-renewing A/E lesions trigger a local innate immune response that protects the epithelium from de novo A/E lesion formation by luminal bacteria. This innate immune response is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner. The study demonstrates that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. The findings suggest that colonic A/E lesions depend on local cell-to-cell spread and not continuous re-seeding from planktonic luminal colonizers, and that the epithelium-adherent population of C. rodentium is derived from a very small founder population, subject to a population bottleneck.
The article presents a Bayesian method for estimating the overlap between two populations of fixed size from incomplete samples. The method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. It also provides a framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates and can be used prospectively in study planning to quantify the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty. The method is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria, where it can be used to estimate the overlap between Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The approach is based on Bayesian inference and assumes that the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known. This is a special case of the more general β-diversity problem. The method is contrasted with existing non-probabilistic indices, coefficients, and metrics, which implicitly treat species counts as complete and lead to bias. The article presents a validation of the method and discusses its potential applications, including the analysis of multigene antigen families in Plasmodium spp. and general studies of β-diversity in multigene families. The method can be improved by incorporating larger whole-genome datasets as prior information over the distribution of repertoire sizes.
The active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases are regulated by a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model, researchers have identified a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. These interactions are essential for the active state mechanics, but surprisingly, the highly conserved lysine residue in the β3-strand is not required for phosphoryl transfer. Instead, it acts as a structural ATP sensor that facilitates the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking it with the αC-helix. The researchers used biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to study the interactions and found that the absence of the salt bridge and electrostatic interaction between the activation loop and αC-helix can be compensated by the R-spine and Shell through hydrophobic interactions. They also showed that repositioning the positive lysine onto the G-loop can rescue the catalytic activity. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of the active state mechanics of eukaryotic protein kinases and highlight the importance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in this process.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. To assess the effectiveness of post-MDA surveillance, two survey designs were compared: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community-based survey targeting individuals aged ≥8 years. In 2016, a systematic school-based Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) was conducted in 29 elementary schools, and a cluster survey was conducted in 28 villages on the two main islands. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. The school-based TAS identified nine antigen-positive children, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1.8). In contrast, the community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5-8.6). The community-based survey also found that CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school-based TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey was more effective in identifying antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA.
In zebrafish, sex determination is a complex process influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that oocytes play a crucial role in maintaining the female sex phenotype in adult zebrafish, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study investigated the role of two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Bmp15 and Gdf9, in female sex determination and maintenance in zebrafish. The researchers generated targeted mutations in the genes encoding Bmp15 and Gdf9 and found that females deficient in Bmp15 undergo sex reversal during the mid- to late-juvenile stage and develop as fertile males. In contrast, females deficient in Gdf9 did not exhibit sex reversal. The study also showed that estrogen production is necessary for female development and that Bmp15 likely regulates estrogen biosynthesis by promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. The researchers propose a model in which the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes cyp19a1a expression and estrogen production in the somatic gonad, thereby maintaining the female sex phenotype. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish and identifies Bmp15 as a key player in this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of sex determination and maintenance in other fish species.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling morphogenetic diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating target genes in a highly localized manner. To achieve this high-regulatory specificity, Hox proteins are thought to co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a context-specific manner. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. This study investigates the regulation of the cell death gene reaper ( rpr ) by the Hox protein Deformed ( Dfd ) in Drosophila. The results show that Dfd requires at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators to properly regulate rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment. These regulators include Apt, Gcm, Ems, En, Slp1, Brk, Doc1, and Disco. The study suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements ( HREs ) are responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. This implies that a large number of transcription factors are directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo. The findings support the idea that Hox target gene regulation involves complex formation between Hox proteins and assisting co-regulatory factors, and that the ability of a broadly expressed Hox protein to regulate a target gene in a proper spatial and temporal context is achieved by the Hox-independent recruitment of context-specific transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences present in compact HREs.
The study investigated the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive plant NB-LRR intracellular innate immune receptor, ADR1-L2. ADR1-L2 is a coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein that functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in several defense contexts. The protein can act as a "helper" to transduce specific microbial activation signals from "sensor" NB-LRRs. The study generated an autoactive missense mutation, ADR1-L2D484V, in a small homology motif termed MHD. Expression of ADR1-L2D484V leads to dwarfed plants with increased disease resistance and constitutively high SA levels. The morphological phenotype also requires an intact P-loop, suggesting that these ADR1-L2D484V phenotypes reflect canonical activation of this NB-LRR protein. Signaling from ADR1-L2D484V does not require NADPH oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. Transcriptional regulation of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs, which are both SA-dependent and -independent. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA-gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling initially observed in the absence of LSD1. Importantly, ADR1-L2D484V autoactivation signaling is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways. The study proposes a genetic model that provides insight into an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop, which includes ADR1-L2.
The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway plays a crucial role in transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis. Recent studies have shown that the SU(VAR)3-9 homolog SUVH9 and the double-stranded RNA-binding protein IDN2 are components of the RdDM pathway. However, the mechanism by which SUVH9 interacts with MORC6, a protein that mediates transcriptional silencing, remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between SUVH9, IDN2, and MORC6 in transcriptional silencing. The results show that SUVH2 and SUVH9 can act in the same pathway as MORC6 or synergistically with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. IDN2 also interacts with MORC6 and mediates the silencing of a subset of MORC6 target loci. Furthermore, other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. The study also demonstrates that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 and SUVH9, and mediate transcriptional silencing. These findings suggest that the RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, which enhances transcriptional silencing at methylated genomic regions. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis and highlights the importance of the RdDM pathway in regulating gene expression.
This study investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) in vertebrate development using zebrafish as a model organism. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in protein folding and stability, and its function has been shown to buffer genetic variation in Drosophila and plants. The researchers found that partial inhibition of Hsp90 function in zebrafish revealed previously unobserved developmental anomalies, including severe structural eye malformations reminiscent of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex in humans. In contrast to Drosophila, Hsp90 inhibition in zebrafish decreased developmental stability, as indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia and sunrise phenotypes. The study also showed that inbreeding of offspring from selected unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies and revealed the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Analysis of the sunrise pax6b mutation suggests a molecular mechanism for the buffering of mutations by Hsp90. The results imply that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies where the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular events that can alter the balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes.
The study identifies and functionally characterizes N-terminally acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Amino-terminal acetylation is a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life, where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain becomes co-translationally acetylated after the removal of the initiating methionine residue. The researchers analyzed amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. They found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. The study proposes the (X)PX rule, which indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances, as the sole true determinant for N-terminal acetylation. This rule can be used to genetically engineer a protein to study the biological relevance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group. The researchers applied the assay by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies, demonstrating a straightforward strategy to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. The (X)PX rule is proposed to be of general validity in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting its applicability to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species. The study provides a comprehensive compilation of mature protein N-termini from Drosophila melanogaster, showing that N-terminal acetylation follows the same rules as in other eukaryotes and occurs with a lower frequency than in humans but at a higher frequency than in yeast.
RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) plays a crucial role in producing abundant tRNA molecules during cellular proliferation, development, and cancer. However, the mechanisms of RNAP III termination and its link to high transcription output are not fully understood. To investigate this, researchers used two tRNA-mediated suppression systems to screen for RNAP III mutants with gain- and loss-of-termination phenotypes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A total of 122 point mutations were identified and mapped to a 3.9 Å structure of yeast RNAP III elongation complex. The mutations cluster in the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel, indicating the involvement of the RNA cleavage domain of the C11 subunit in termination. Purified RNAP III from a readthrough mutant exhibited increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic coupling model where elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. The mutants showed good correlations between terminator readthrough in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. The results suggest that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including C11, are key determinants of termination, and that some mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription. These findings have implications for understanding RNAP III activation in disease, as similar mutations have been observed in spontaneous cancer.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains using the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. This approach was shown to perform similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. The method was used to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. The predictions were validated using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling. The FoldX algorithm was also shown to predict the in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phosphopeptide complexes for nine different SH2 domains, demonstrating its applicability for genome-wide predictions. The results suggest that the FoldX algorithm is a useful alternative to peptide library experiments for the prediction of SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. The portability of this method to other SH2 domains remains to be shown, and future prediction methods should account for both the biophysics and biology of SH2 domains. A set of predicted in vivo protein-protein interactions for nine SH2 domain-containing proteins was annotated with supporting information, providing a resource for further experimental testing.
Human cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), a cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase), has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins. The study demonstrates that CyP40 dissolves tau amyloids in vitro and reduces tau oligomers and tangles in a mouse model of tau accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed that CyP40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues. Furthermore, CyP40 was able to interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins that contain prolines. The PPIase activity of CyP40 is essential for its disaggregation activity, as a CyP40 variant lacking PPIase activity was unable to disaggregate amyloids in vitro. The study also describes a unique structural property of CyP40 that may permit disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner. The results suggest that strategies to induce or deliver CyP40 to the central nervous system could potentially halt or rescue cognitive deficits associated with neurotoxic amyloids. The study identifies CyP40 as a novel human protein disaggregase and demonstrates its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids. The findings have implications for the development of therapeutic interventions for tauopathies and other amyloidogenic disorders.
The article presents an integrative approach for modeling and simulating heterocyst pattern formation in cyanobacteria filaments using systems biology. Heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria is a simple example of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. Despite experimental studies on the evolution and sustainment of heterocyst patterns and the genetic circuit underlying single cyanobacterium behavior under nitrogen deprivation, there is a theoretical gap connecting these processes. To address this issue, the authors formulate the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium into a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of molecular product concentrations. This allows them to study the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions and simulate the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their genetic circuits via molecular diffusion. The results show that including diffusion and noisy external conditions in the computational model can reproduce the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment in cyanobacteria filaments as observed experimentally. The model connects the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament with the dynamical properties of the underlying genetic circuit of each single cyanobacterium, capturing both the development and maintenance of heterocyst patterns. The study demonstrates that noise plays an important role in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heterocyst patterns for a wide range of model parameters. This reveals that cyanobacteria filaments have developed an efficient response to noisy environmental conditions.
The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program has been implemented in Cameroon for over 15 years to combat onchocerciasis, a disease causing debilitating eye and skin lesions with significant psychosocial and economic impacts. Despite this effort, onchocerciasis prevalence remains above the non-transmission threshold in many areas. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three Cameroonian health districts to investigate the association between people's perceptions of the CDTI program, their beliefs about onchocerciasis, and their adherence to ivermectin treatment. The study found that adherence to ivermectin was comparable in two districts, Bafang and Bafia, but lower in Yabassi. Perceptions of the CDTI program, particularly the commitment of community drug distributors and the organization of ivermectin distribution campaigns, were strongly associated with adherence to ivermectin. In contrast, misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as the belief that onchocerciasis is caused by poor hygiene or high sugar intake, were not strongly associated with adherence. The study highlights the importance of addressing community perceptions and misconceptions about the CDTI program and onchocerciasis transmission in order to improve adherence to ivermectin treatment. Local health authorities are recommended to involve communities more in the implementation of the CDTI program and to emphasize the effectiveness of ivermectin in addition to education and sensitization on onchocerciasis.
The study investigated the relative contribution of DNA methylation and genetic variants on protein biomarkers for human diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and over 10 million SNPs. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed on between 698 and 1033 samples, depending on data availability. The results identified 124 and 45 loci with significant associations between DNA methylation and protein biomarkers, and between SNPs and protein biomarkers, respectively. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. However, all EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants, and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. The study found that cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect on DNA methylation levels, but not vice versa. The results suggest that DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases, and instead reflects the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represents secondary effects of the pathogenesis of disease.
The study reveals that varicella zoster virus (VZV) potently impairs the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to respond to target cell stimulation in vitro, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment is not limited to VZV-infected NK cells, but also affects VZV antigen-negative NK cells that are exposed to the virus in culture. The study demonstrates that direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected inoculum cells is required for this effect. Profiling of the NK cell surface receptor phenotype shows that functional receptor expression is predominantly stable, and inhibited NK cells are still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when the stimulation signal bypasses receptor/ligand interactions and early signaling. However, VZV co-culture leads to perturbation of the degranulation signaling cascade and repression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. The study also shows that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a closely related virus, exhibits a similar capacity to infect NK cells and render them unresponsive to target cell stimulation, although it differentially targets cytokine production compared to VZV. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of pathogen inhibition of NK cell function and reveal a previously unreported strategy employed by VZV to manipulate the immune response.
Apparent motion (AM) is a phenomenon where two stimuli alternately presented at different locations can evoke a percept of a stimulus continuously moving between the two locations. The neural mechanism underlying AM is thought to involve increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path. However, evidence for this remains inconclusive. AM masking, which refers to the reduced detectability of stimuli along the AM path, has been taken as evidence for AM-related V1 activation. However, this can also be explained by predictive coding models, which predict that responses to stimuli presented on the AM path are suppressed when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. The present study investigated the effect of AM on the detection of target gratings presented along the AM path. The results show that AM impairs the detection of a target presented on the AM path when the target's orientation matches the inducers' orientation. A population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model, was developed to explain the findings. The model predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding. The results suggest that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to cause masking or be perceived as motion, and that orientation-tuned suppression of responses in early visual cortex is the major cause of AM masking. This suppression may be explained by predictive coding models of cortical processing, proposing that higher-level predictions of motion are generated, which "explain away" lower-level responses to expected sensory input.
The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in CD4+ T cell transformation by activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing NF-κB target genes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IKK activation, researchers reconstituted Tax-stimulated IKK activation in a cell-free system to dissect the essential cellular components for primary IKK activation by Tax. The study revealed that Tax functions as a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzing the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains with the help of UbcH2, UhcH5c, or UbcH7. These free polyubiquitin chains directly activate IKK by binding to the NEMO subunit of IKK. This biochemical function of Tax clarifies the confusion surrounding HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation and identifies the essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV-1. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IKK activation, which utilizes minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation. The findings have significant implications for understanding HTLV-1-mediated transformation and may shed light on the development of therapeutics for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM).
The relationship between the number of individuals introduced to found a population (propagule pressure) and the establishment success of alien species has been investigated in a systematic and quantitative review using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The study found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success across a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. However, establishment success was most critically dependent on propagule pressures in the range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. In contrast, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. The results reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success. The study highlights the importance of propagule pressure as a determinant of establishment success and provides insights into the factors influencing the strength and shape of this relationship.
Interleukin 17A (IL-17), a cytokine involved in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases, has been shown to enhance the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the degradation of encoding mRNAs. The degradation of these mRNAs depends on proteins (AUBPs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs and facilitate either mRNA decay or stabilization. A novel ribonucleoprotein complex is formed between AUBPs and the target mRNA in the presence of microRNA16 (miR16), leading to the degradation of the target mRNA. However, IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBPs over destabilizing AUBPs, resulting in reduced mRNA decay. This indicates that miR16, independent of a seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBPs for target mRNAs. The interactions between AUBPs, miR16, and the target mRNA depend on specific RNA sequences and structural restraints. IL-17 exerts its function by changing the contribution of miR16 and AUBPs. The findings suggest that modulation of AUBP-miR16 mediated regulation of gene expression by IL-17 depends on the specific mRNA target, limiting miR16 usage and differential participation of the AUBPs. IL-17 may affect many other cellular processes, given that AUBPs affect expression of about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR16 is ubiquitously expressed.
The study investigated the association between bovine and human trypanosomiasis in newly affected sleeping sickness areas of Uganda. The research was conducted in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, where the acute zoonotic form of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has been spreading rapidly. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human-infective Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, showing few signs of morbidity but posing a significant risk to human health. The study examined the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and human-infective and non-human T. brucei s.l. circulating in cattle at the village level. The results showed that the sleeping sickness status of a village had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s.l. infection in cattle, with higher odds of infection in case villages compared to non-case villages. Additionally, cattle age was found to be a significant factor, with cattle between 18-36 months and over 36 months having significantly higher odds of T. brucei s.l. infection than those under 18 months of age. The study also found a significant association between village human sleeping sickness status and the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in village cattle, with a higher likelihood of detection in case villages. The findings suggest that a high village-level prevalence of T. brucei s.l. is associated with a higher likelihood of detecting T. b. rhodesiense in a herd, providing a useful means of determining risk at the village or parish level in endemic districts in Uganda.
The NSL complex, which contains the histone H4 lysine 16-specific acetyltransferase MOF, plays a crucial role in regulating housekeeping genes in Drosophila. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex members (NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2) across the Drosophila melanogaster genome revealed that the majority (85.5%) of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. These genes are characterized by increased abundance of histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions, as well as a well-defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. Furthermore, ChIP-seq analyses of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in NSL1- and NSL3-depleted cells demonstrated that both NSL proteins are required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to NSL target gene promoters. The observed Pol II reduction coincides with compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters, indicating that the NSL complex is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation complex on target genes. Genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication-related Element (DRE). The NSL complex preferentially targets genes that are constitutively expressed, also referred to as housekeeping genes, and exhibits elevated levels of H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, and H4K16ac, as well as a distinctive arrangement of the nucleosome-free region and dispersed transcription initiation patterns.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a germline transcription factor. The model consists of two transgenic mouse lines: one carrying a D4Z4 genomic region from a contracted pathogenic FSHD1 allele and one carrying a normal-sized, non-pathogenic allele. The results show that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, and contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA methylation analyses indicate a relative chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeats in mice carrying the contracted allele compared to those carrying the normal-sized allele. This is consistent with the observed DUX4 expression pattern, accurately modeling the difference between FSHD patients and control individuals. The transgenic mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, incomplete epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. These mice represent a valuable animal model for FSHD and will be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and testing new therapeutic intervention strategies.
Malaria vaccine candidate Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) has been shown to induce protection, but only against parasite strains closely related to the vaccine. To overcome this limitation, researchers developed a vaccine containing four diverse allelic proteins (AMA1 Quadvax or QV), which elicited polyclonal rabbit antibodies that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Compared to a strain-specific, monovalent, 3D7 AMA1 vaccine, QV induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. These mAbs were ∼10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Another novel mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. These findings suggest that vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes. The identification of novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes can form the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines.
The displacement of the mitotic spindle to one side of a cell is crucial for many cells to divide unequally. A conserved mitotic progression mechanism, involving the anaphase-promoting complex ( APC ), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its degradation target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ), has been identified as a timer for spindle displacement in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. Mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time, soon after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Reducing the function of the proteasome, the APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delays spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometaphase causes the spindle to displace early. The consequence of experimentally unlinking spindle displacement from this timing mechanism is the premature displacement of incompletely assembled components of the mitotic spindle. This study demonstrates that the timing of spindle displacement is precisely regulated in the C. elegans zygote and that the proteasome and the APC time spindle displacement primarily through their roles in inactivating CDK. The results suggest that negative regulation of CDK activity by the proteasome, FZY-1, and the APC serves as a previously unrecognized timer for mitotic spindle displacement. This regulation of spindle displacement by CDK activity results in an approximately 60–90-s delay in spindle displacement, allowing spindle assembly to complete before cortical forces pull the spindle away from the center of the cell. This study provides the first demonstration that mitotic progression times spindle displacement in the asymmetric division of an animal cell.
A genome scan was conducted to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetan and Andean populations. High-altitude hypoxia poses severe physiological stress on the human body, and populations living in high-altitude regions such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Andean Altiplano have developed unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. Although the physiological responses to high-altitude hypoxia have been well characterized, the underlying genetic basis remains unknown. The study used four population genetic statistics to detect signatures of natural selection and identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in the Tibetan and Andean populations separately. The results showed that the Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. One gene, EGLN1 ( also known as PHD2 ), previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, but with differing patterns of variation between the two populations. The study suggests that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These findings provide a basis for future genotype-phenotype association studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.
Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near a double-strand DNA break (DSB) can alter the repair pathway from accurate gene conversion to break-induced replication (BIR), leading to genetic instability. IRs can form unusual DNA structures when present in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formed by DSB resection. The type of structure formed depends on the length of the spacer separating the IRs: long (1-kb) spacers lead to inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) and the formation of inverted dimers, while short (12-bp) spacers result in intra-molecular SSA and fold-back (FB) structures. Both types of structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and channel repair into BIR, promoting genomic destabilization. The processing of FBs containing short versus long ssDNA loops involves different protein complexes: MRX-Sae2 for short loops and Rad1-Rad10 for long loops. The presence of IRs near a DSB promotes BIR and decreases the frequency of gene conversion, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. This study highlights the mechanisms of genomic destabilization resulting from re-routing DSB repair into unusual pathways by IRs, which are abundant in the human genome. The findings may contribute to understanding IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with human disease. The choice of DSB repair pathway is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, as some pathways result in mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, while others do not.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic P. aeruginosa infections are thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms, which are highly structured, multicellular communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. To study P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo, researchers developed an animal model using Drosophila melanogaster as the host. In this model, P. aeruginosa biofilms localized to and were visualized in dissected Drosophila crops at 24 hours post-infection. The biofilms had a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. P. aeruginosa cells recovered from in vivo grown biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonically grown cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pelB::lux mutant was more virulent than PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain ( PAZHI3 ) demonstrated less virulence than PAO1. Biofilm formation by strains PAO1 and PAZHI3 in the crop was associated with the induction of diptericin, cecropin A1, and drosomycin antimicrobial peptide gene expression 24 hours post-infection. In contrast, infection with the non-biofilm forming strain pelB::lux resulted in decreased AMP gene expression in the fly. These results provide novel insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa oral infection of Drosophila and highlight the use of Drosophila as an infection model for studying P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo.
The vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a) plays a crucial role in mediating vasopressin-mediated social behaviors and exhibits striking differences in neural expression patterns between species. The genomic mechanisms contributing to these differences are not well understood. This study used homologous recombination in mice to investigate the relative contribution of the proximal 5′ flanking sequence and microsatellite variation to Avpr1a gene expression and behavior. The results show that the proximal 5′ flanking sequence makes a modest contribution to species differences in vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) distribution, and that variation in V1aR distribution impacts stress-coping behavior in the forced swim test. Additionally, the study found that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring a subset of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This is the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles. However, the results suggest that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5′ flanking region of the gene. The study demonstrates that the vole Avpr1a is an ideal model locus for exploring the genomic mechanisms contributing to diversity in brain gene expression and behavior.
Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin switch (S) regions and the c-MYC oncogene in yeast THO mutants, which are impaired in messenger RNA (mRNP) biogenesis. AID-mediated deamination of cytosines at S sequences in yeast is channeled by the Ung1 activity into DSBs, similar to mammalian B cells, which are then repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). The c-MYC oncogene, sharing features with S sequences, acts as a hotspot of recombination in yeast THO mutants. This study demonstrates that AID acts in yeast at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences, leading to DSBs that cause chromosomal translocations via NHEJ. AID-induced translocations are strongly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants, consistent with the idea that AID-mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation. The study provides new insights into the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. It also shows that yeast cells, like mammalian B cells, have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and Class Switch Recombination (CSR). A model yeast system has been developed to study the molecular mechanisms mediated by AID leading to DSBs at S regions and the c-MYC oncogene, opening new perspectives in understanding AID-mediated rearrangements.
During asymmetric cell division in Escherichia coli, the coordination between cell division and chromosome replication is crucial for producing viable progeny. However, cells lacking proper positioning of their cell division planes can still successfully propagate. This study investigated how these cells partition their chromosomes into daughters during asymmetric divisions. Using quantitative time-lapse imaging, the authors found that DNA translocase, FtsK, can pump up to 80% of the chromosome ( 3. 7 Mb ) between daughters at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s. Pauses in DNA translocation were rare, and no reversals were observed at experimental time scales of a few minutes. The majority of DNA movement occurred at the latest stages of cell division when the cell division protein ZipA had already dissociated from the septum, and the septum had closed to a narrow channel with a diameter much smaller than the resolution limit of the microscope ( ~250 nm ). The authors suggest that the narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK. This study demonstrates that E. coli cells are capable of repositioning their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly localized. The results also imply that DNA located within the constriction realizes a cell-cycle checkpoint that prevents daughters from separating from each other.
The article presents a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) for the selection of an optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines (EVs). EVs have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious diseases and cancer. The development of an EV is based on the knowledge of target-specific antigens from which immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, are derived. However, the number of epitopes that can be included in an EV is limited due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns. Additionally, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding these epitopes is highly polymorphic, making the optimal selection of epitopes an important optimization problem. The proposed ILP framework allows the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and the efficient identification of optimal sets of epitopes. The framework selects the set of epitopes with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. The ILP approach is demonstrated to outperform a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm, with runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes. The framework is flexible enough to account for variants of the problem, including personalized vaccines, and is the first epitope selection framework to find the optimal solution.
The study investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo. IL-7 is a cytokine present in semen, and its concentration is increased in HIV-1-infected individuals. The researchers simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable to those found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. The results showed that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues revealed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells. The study suggests that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may facilitate the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection. The findings indicate that IL-7 may play a significant role in HIV-1 male-to-female transmission, making the female lower genital tract mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition.
Zika virus ( ZIKV ) induces the production of virus-specific small RNAs in Aedes aegypti cells, including both exogenous short interfering RNAs ( exo-siRNAs ) and PIWI-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ). The exo-siRNA pathway is considered a key antiviral response mechanism in mosquitoes, and ZIKV-specific siRNAs were found to be loaded into the effector protein Argonaute 2 ( Ago2 ). However, knockdown of Ago2 did not enhance ZIKV replication, suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway may not be the primary antiviral response to ZIKV. In contrast, a Dcr2-knockout cell line showed enhanced ZIKV replication, indicating that the exo-siRNA pathway is involved in the antiviral response. ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs were also detected, but they lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and were bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of Ago3, Piwi5, or Piwi6 did not enhance ZIKV replication, but silencing of Piwi4 displayed antiviral activity. The expression of ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike yellow fever virus capsid protein, it did not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. These findings elucidate ZIKV-mosquito RNAi interactions that are important for understanding its spread. The results suggest that the exo-siRNA pathway plays a role in the antiviral response to ZIKV in Aedes aegypti cells.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis. A total of 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis were analyzed, and their isolates were studied using phenotypic and genotypic methods. The results showed that Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with atypical clinical presentations, including disseminated cutaneous infection without underlying disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection. In contrast, patients infected with Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto presented with less severe and more localized disease, similar to the majority of previously described sporotrichosis cases. Notably, patients infected with S. brasiliensis required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment (median 16 weeks) compared to those infected with S. schenckii (median 24 weeks). These findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. This study provides new information on the clinical implications of the recent changes in the taxonomy of Sporothrix and highlights the importance of careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis.
The mammalian genome was previously thought to be more pervasively transcribed than currently annotated genes suggest. However, a recent study used single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in human and mouse tissues. The results indicate that most transcripts outside of known exons and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are fragments of pre-mRNAs located within introns. Furthermore, the chromosomal locations of the majority of intergenic transcripts are near known genes, suggesting alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. In fact, reads that bridge splice sites identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. The study also found that most intergenic and intronic transcripts have very low sequence coverage, with 70-80% of the transcribed area detected by a single RNA-Seq read in only one sample, consistent with random placement. In contrast, tiling arrays are ill-suited to accurately detect transcripts expressed at low levels. The majority of non-exonic transcripts in RNA-Seq data are associated with known genes, including thousands of new alternative exons and hundreds of alternative promoters. A genome-wide analysis of de novo splice junctions revealed 2,789 previously uncharacterized transcript fragments, 1,259 of which map to intergenic regions. Overall, the study concludes that while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance are generally low compared to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
Scientists have developed a novel method to enhance the thermostability of the Bacillus subtilis YtvA LOV domain, a flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein. The YtvA LOV domain, also known as Flavin mononucleotide-based Fluorescent Protein (FbFP), has potential applications in studying anaerobic microorganisms, particularly thermophilic ones. However, its moderate thermostability limits its use in high-temperature environments. To address this issue, a combined computational and experimental approach was employed to increase the thermostability of FbFP. The method involves five steps: single mutant computer screening, experimental evaluation, computational redesign, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. This approach resulted in a 31°C increase in the melting temperature (Tm) of FbFP, making it more suitable for use in thermophilic systems. The method was found to be effective, with a success rate of 62%, and identified eight thermostable sites, five of which are located at the dimeric interface. The mutant V120I showed the highest thermostability, with a Tm of 54.2°C. This study provides a new tool for enhancing protein thermostability, which can be particularly useful when conventional methods, such as directed evolution, fail. The approach can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties, offering a promising solution for protein engineering.
A study was conducted to investigate the diversity of Lutzomyia sand fly species and their infection rates by Leishmania and Wolbachia on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The island is located in the central watershed of the Panama Canal and is a region where cutaneous leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat for residents, tourists, and the international research community. The study used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and probable phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of the island. The results supported 18 morphology-based species determinations and revealed the presence of two possible "cryptic" species. Leishmania DNA was detected in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals, and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. The Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi was identified as Leishmania (viannia) naiffi, a species previously unknown in Panama but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. Distinct strains of Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. The study suggests that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species, and that Le. naiffi may have recently expanded its range to include the Isthmus of Panama. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is a significant clinical concern due to its devastating consequences. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV reactivation, focusing on the role of mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK) family and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The results show that ERK-mediated reactivation is dependent on the MSK family, which is recruited to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP) through CREB binding. CREB binding to the MIEP provides a target for MSK recruitment, and MSK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. The study used an adenovirus vector approach to directly associate the ERK-MSK relationship with CREB-histone H3 phosphorylation and the induction of IE gene expression from latency. The results demonstrate that IE gene expression from latency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition and that reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of histones bound to the latent MIEP. Furthermore, the study provides in vivo evidence for a functional interaction between MSK and CREB at promoters, which is essential for controlling the gene expression of HCMV. The findings suggest that specific inhibition of the interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a therapeutic strategy for preventing HCMV reactivation.
The ribosome biogenesis factor Nol11 plays a crucial role in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development. Nol11 is strongly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of both amphibians and mammals, and its knockdown in Xenopus results in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of craniofacial cartilages. The study reveals a novel requirement for Nol11 in craniofacial development and provides further insight into the evolutionarily conserved relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis factors and the control mechanisms that regulate CNC survival and development. The findings demonstrate that Nol11 is essential for optimal pre-rRNA transcription and processing in Xenopus, and that its knockdown leads to activation of the nucleolar stress response and p53 stabilization. The study also shows that inhibition of p53 rescues the craniofacial phenotype but not the underlying ribosome biogenesis defect, indicating an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism through which ribosome-impaired craniofacial cells are removed. The results suggest that excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofacial development. The study presents the first frog model of a ribosomopathy and provides further insight into the clinically important relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis proteins and craniofacial cell survival. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of Nol11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development.
A high-density protein microarray approach was used to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni in 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients, and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. The protein microarray chip comprised 2,421 proteins, representing 61% of the Leptospira interrogans proteome. A nitrocellulose line blot assay was performed to validate the accuracy of the protein microarray results. The study identified 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the identified antigens, such as LipL32, the non-identical domains of the Lig proteins, GroEL, and Loa22, are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients, serving as proof-of-concept for the serodiagnostic antigen discovery approach. Novel antigens, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. The study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection, and novel as well as known serodiagnostic leptospiral antigens were identified. The novel antigens may have potential use in the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing leptospirosis. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
This study investigated the role of melanization in mosquito defense against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana using Anopheles gambiae as a model. Melanization is a potent immune effector mechanism in arthropods, but its contribution to anti-fungal defense remains poorly understood. The study found that melanin formed on all stages of B. bassiana, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, but rarely aborted fungal growth. Silencing TEP1 and CLIPA8, key regulators of Plasmodium and bacterial melanization, abolished melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. The study suggests that melanization of early fungal stages is cell-mediated, while late-stage melanization is a humoral response dependent on TEP1 and CLIPA8. Microscopic analysis revealed that TEP1 is associated with the surfaces of hyphae and that both TEP1 and CLIPA8 are required for recruiting phenoloxidase to these surfaces. Furthermore, fungal proliferation was more rapid in TEP1 and CLIPA8 knockdown mosquitoes, which exhibited increased sensitivity to natural B. bassiana infections. The study concludes that the mosquito melanization response significantly retards B. bassiana growth and dissemination, a finding that may be exploited to design transgenic fungi with enhanced bio-control activities against mosquitoes.
The study investigated the potential of four compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), to inhibit dengue virus (DENV) infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. The compounds were tested for their ability to block DENV infection in the mosquito midgut using various treatment methods, including direct injection, ingestion through sugar feeding or blood feeding, and RNA interference (RNAi). The results showed that BAF and MPA were effective in inhibiting DENV infection, with BAF reducing titers in the midgut by 56% and MPA reducing titers by 60% at 7 days post-infection. In contrast, CAS and DNJ did not affect susceptibility to the virus. RNAi-mediated silencing of vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene also resulted in reduced DENV infection, indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition occurred through the inhibition of these DENV host factors (HFs). The study found that the route and timing of BAF and MPA administration were crucial, and treatment after exposure to the virus diminished the antiviral effect of these compounds. The results provide proof-of-principle that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of DENV HFs, specifically vATPase and IMPDH, can be used to suppress DENV infection in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which may lead to a reduction in DENV transmission.
The Role of Cell Volume in the Dynamics of Seizure, Spreading Depression, and Anoxic Depolarization
    A recent study investigated the effects of cell volume on neuronal dynamics in the context of seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. By incorporating cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics, the researchers demonstrated the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states as the cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. The study revealed a dynamical definition for the physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. The results highlight the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provide novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. The study argues that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane, which can be understood only when dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors, which may be of substantial importance in understanding and potentially developing universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.
The study investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (P. brasiliensis) infection. P. brasiliensis is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis prevalent in Latin America. The study found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) responded to P. brasiliensis yeast cells by releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1, and NLRP3-dependent manner. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was also dependent on potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin B release. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that IL-1β signaling plays a crucial role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. The results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection and plays an important role in host defense against this fungus. The study also showed that IL-1β production by BMDCs infected with P. brasiliensis requires NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent activation of caspase-1. Additionally, the study found that IL-1β-mediated signaling is essential for the activation of macrophage fungicidal activity against P. brasiliensis. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the host response to P. brasiliensis infection.
Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-tropic parasite that infects most nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. However, in vivo studies have shown that Toxoplasma is primarily found in neurons, suggesting that neurons may be the primary target cell for the parasite. To investigate this theory, a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model was developed to mark and track host cells that interact with parasites, even if the interaction is transient. Using this model, it was found that Toxoplasma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout central nervous system (CNS) infection. This predilection remained even in the presence of interferon-γ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to the major mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, or when parasites were directly injected into the brain. These findings suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather are Toxoplasma's primary in vivo target. The study also found that neurons consistently make up the majority of the GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, regardless of time point or infecting strain, contradicting the "astrocyte-killing" model of CNS-Toxoplasma interactions. The results of this study provide new insights into the host cell-pathogen dynamics of Toxoplasma infection and have implications for the development of therapies to eliminate persistent pathogens.
A free-boundary model of actin-myosin contractility has been developed to explain the turning behavior of motile cells undergoing lamellipodial motility. The model consists of force-balance and myosin transport equations that account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow that reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations representing myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories. The motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. The contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell. The model predicts that the aspect ratio of a steadily moving cell varies between 1 and 3, in agreement with experimental observations.
The article presents a novel technique for assessing the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks obtained from experimental studies. The technique utilizes a geometric graph model, which is the best fitting network model for PPI networks, to predict new interactions and guide future biological experiments. The approach achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%, outperforming existing PPI network post-processing techniques. The method is applied to the human PPI network, downloaded from BioGRID, and predicts 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions are validated in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available online. The technique detects false positives and false negative interactions in PPI data sets, including those obtained from yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification (TAP) experiments, which are known to have high levels of noise and incompleteness. The method does not require multiple PPI datasets or a priori information about individual proteins, such as binding domains, structure, function, chemical properties, or sequence. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the geometric graph model in assessing the confidence levels of known interactions and predicting novel ones in PPI networks.
A Drosophila model for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has been established to investigate the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG repeat transcripts in disease pathogenesis. The study reveals that co-expression of CTG and CAG expanded repeats leads to dramatically enhanced toxicity in flies, accompanied by the generation of 21-nt triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs target the expression of CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which bear long CAG repeats in both flies and humans. The findings suggest that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may significantly contribute to toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases where anti-sense transcription occurs. The study also demonstrates that non-coding, uninterrupted CTG repeats confer length-dependent toxicity when expressed in brain and muscle in flies, recapitulating key features of the human disease DM1. Furthermore, the co-expression of CTG and CAG expanded repeats results in novel pathogenesis, including the generation of dcr-2 and ago2-dependent 21-nt triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These results indicate that anti-sense repeat transcripts may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of trinucleotide repeat diseases, including DM1, and highlight the potential of Drosophila as a model system for studying human neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.
The soft rot phytopathogen Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 has been reclassified from Pectobacterium carotovorum based on genomic analysis and proteome comparisons with other sequenced soft rot bacteria. The strain was originally isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s and has since been used as a model strain in soft rot research. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Pectobacterium wasabiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, including Europe and potentially North America, although it has gone unnoticed. A combination of genomic approaches and in planta experiments identified novel virulence determinants of Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193, including a putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters containing predicted virulence genes. The absence of a type III secretion system is a distinctive feature separating Pectobacterium wasabiae from other soft rot bacteria. Genome comparison also revealed other traits that may be related to life in planta or specific environmental conditions, such as a predicted benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin. These findings indicate that Pectobacterium wasabiae has a reservoir of unknown traits that may be utilized during the poorly understood latent stage of infection. The revised phylogeny and novel virulence determinants of Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 provide a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria.
This study investigated the systemic alterations of mitochondrial protein expression in response to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion using network analysis of gene expression data. Mitochondrial protein repertoire varies depending on the cellular state, and protein component modifications caused by mtDNA depletion are related to a wide range of human diseases. The researchers used a data-integrative approach to select reliable mitochondrial proteins for network analysis and discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks with distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules were involved in typical mitochondrial functions such as energy production, metabolism, and protein folding, while up-regulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that mtDNA-depleted cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. The results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. This study provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions and can be valuable to the computational biology community working on gene expression and proteomics analysis. The findings suggest that eukaryotic cells can monitor and respond to changes in mt conditions through alterations of nuclear gene expression.
The article presents a novel method to deduce the kinetics of protein synthesis in vivo from transition rates measured in vitro. The method involves two main components: the kinetic distance, a quantitative measure of the similarity between in-vitro and in-vivo kinetics, and a constrained minimization procedure that reproduces a known global property, such as the overall in-vivo speed. The kinetic distance depends logarithmically on the transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of the underlying free energy barriers. The authors apply this method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression, using a codon-specific Markov model with three reaction pathways. They determine the individual transition rates in vitro and predict the in-vivo rates by minimizing the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo processes. The predicted in-vivo rates are validated by three independent sets of in-vivo data, including codon-dependent translation speeds, codon-specific translation dynamics, and missense error frequencies. The results show good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting any fit parameters. The deduced in-vivo rates lead to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, primarily due to an improved initial selection of tRNA. The method is computationally simple and can be applied to any biomolecular process with detailed information about the in-vitro kinetics.
The study investigated the microevolution of Helicobacter pylori during prolonged infection of single hosts and within families. The researchers sequenced an average of 39,300 base pairs in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates, including 34 pairs of sequential samples and single isolates from 29 individuals from 10 families. The results showed that the accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time of separation in a clock-like manner in the sequential isolates. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, the researchers estimated the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts. The estimates indicated that the short-term mutation rate is 1.4×10−6 to 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with three times as many substitutions introduced by recombination as by mutation. The long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection. The study also found that the short-term mutation rates vary dramatically in different bacterial species, spanning a range of several orders of magnitude. The results provide a robust estimate of the mutation rate over years to decades and highlight the importance of purifying selection in shaping the evolution of H. pylori over longer time periods.
Melanopsin, a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs), has been shown to play a crucial role in non-image-forming visual responses, such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. However, its contribution to conventional visual pathways has remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of melanopsin in the thalamo-cortical visual system. Using new reporter lines, the authors found that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. In mice lacking rods and cones, melanopsin input to the dLGN and visual cortex was found to support physiological light responses. Furthermore, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, the authors revealed strong melanopsin input to approximately 40% of neurons in the LGN that showed sustained activation to a light step. This melanopsin input was found to support irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. In melanopsin knockout mice, the ability to accurately encode stimulus irradiance was impaired. These findings establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. The study suggests that melanopsin may support vision in individuals with retinal degeneration and identifies mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a profound depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. This study investigated whether the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals affects humoral responses to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. A comprehensive protein microarray analysis of systemic humoral responses to intestinal microbiota revealed reduced IgG responses to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes. Intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibited elevated IgM levels and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens. These findings indicate reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. The decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study also found a significant increase in IgM levels and a decrease in IgG/IgM and IgA/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to mucosal microbial antigens in intestinal secretions of antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals, indicative of a lack of help for class switch recombination. This dysregulation of mucosal humoral responses may have significant consequences by promoting local inflammation and mucosal barrier damage.
The article proposes a new model for population dynamics in ecosystems where resources are redistributed after a catastrophic collapse of a dominant species. The model, called the "Kill-the-Winner" (KtW) model, assumes that populations grow exponentially until they reach a carrying capacity, at which point a catastrophic collapse occurs, freeing up resources for other species. The system is characterized by "diversity waves," where the population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. The emergent dynamics of the system is characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution of species abundances, with a lower peak formed by recently collapsed or newly introduced species and an upper peak formed by species that have not yet collapsed. The system also exhibits a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. The model is robust to variations in the rules of the model, including diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies. The long-term growth rate of each species is exactly zero, making the classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term exponential growth rate inappropriate. The model provides a general framework for systems driven by redistribution of rate-limiting resources freed up by episodic catastrophes.
Predicted Auxiliary Navigation Mechanism of Peritrichously Flagellated Chemotactic Bacteria
    Chemotactic movement of Escherichia coli is a well-studied paradigm of simple behavior. The chemotaxis system is expected to be strongly optimized due to its significant competitive advantage and high evolution rates in bacteria. Bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemoeffector concentrations along their runs. A sensory system detects concentration differences and transmits them to modulate the rotation of flagellar motors, decreasing the probability of a tumble and reorientation if the perceived concentration change during a run is positive. This regulation of tumble probability is sufficient to explain chemotactic drift of a population up the gradient, and is commonly assumed to be the only navigation mechanism of chemotactic E. coli. However, computer simulations predict the existence of an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli. The simulations suggest that not only the tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during a tumble depend on the swimming direction along the gradient. This fine tuning of tumbling angle results in a dramatic enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient. The study demonstrates a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis, which arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine tuning of tumbling angle. This strategy is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria with similar chemotaxis behavior.
This study investigates the role of Stat3 signaling in the development and homeostasis of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). mTECs are essential for establishing central tolerance by expressing self-peptides that delete autoreactive thymocytes or divert them into the regulatory T cell lineage. Activation of the NFκB signaling pathway in mTEC precursors is crucial for mTEC maturation and proliferation, resulting in proper medullary region formation. The study reveals that Stat3-mediated signaling also plays a key role in mTEC development and homeostasis. Expression of a constitutively active Stat3 transgene targeted to the mTEC compartment increases mTEC cellularity and bypasses the requirement for signals from positively selected thymocytes to drive medullary region formation. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupts medullary region architecture and reduces the number of mTECs. Stat3 signaling promotes the survival of immature MHCIIloCD80lo mTEC precursors, but does not affect mTEC proliferation. The study demonstrates that, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals play an essential role in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis. The findings suggest that Stat3 activation is indispensable for optimal development and maintenance of the thymic medullary compartment.
The article presents a genome-wide identification of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Using an in silico approach, 511 sRNA candidates were identified in both intergenic and coding regions of the C. difficile genome. To validate these predictions, RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq were used to globally identify C. difficile sRNAs and their transcriptional start sites at three different growth conditions: exponential growth phase, stationary phase, and starvation. This approach identified 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans-riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 sRNAs was confirmed by gene-specific experimental approaches. Some sRNAs showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles, and 16 predicted c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches were found to be involved in coordinated control of motility and biofilm formation. Additionally, abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci were detected, which may be important for C. difficile survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of sRNA regulation in C. difficile and highlights the potential diversity of RNA-based mechanisms controlling key steps during the infection cycle of this emergent enteropathogen. The findings provide a firm basis for future RNome characterization and identification of molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in C. difficile.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates the abundance of liver-specific microRNA miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression results in the dysregulation of its known functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies revealed that the 22-nucleotide prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to the 22-nt prototype miR-122. The HCV core protein specifically inhibits GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm is responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Analysis of miR-122 expression levels in human liver biopsies from healthy subjects and patients with HCV revealed decreased miR-122 levels in liver specimens from patients. The results demonstrate that HCV infection interferes with miR-122 3'-end tailing in liver tissues, and the HCV core protein inhibits this modification.
In a study of wild African lions in the Serengeti, researchers have found evidence of acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes disease in humans and livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The study discovered a distinct peak and decrease in age prevalence of T. brucei s.l. infection in lions, which is consistent with an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species, T. congolense s.l. This cross-immunity appears to allow lions to clear most infections of T. brucei s.l. by 3-5 years of age and eliminate all infections of T. brucei rhodesiense by the age of 6 years. The findings suggest that frequent re-exposure to each trypanosome species through tsetse bites accelerates the onset and extent of immunity, resulting in lower prevalence in areas of high-tsetse exposure. The study provides the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species and challenges the long-held assumption that immunity to trypanosomes is impossible. The results have significant implications for the development of vaccines against trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by T. brucei rhodesiense, which is the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. The discovery of acquired immunity in lions generates a new perspective on existing data and future research in this field, particularly in regions where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection, such as East Uganda.
A computational model of the human coagulation cascade was developed and validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different in vitro coagulation models. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein–protein interactions, accurately simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants, with a mean correlation of 0. 87 across all trials. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X ( fX/FXa ) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while factor IX/activated factor IX ( fIX/FIXa ) and factor VIII/activated factor VIII ( fVIII/FVIIIa ) activation and activity were robust. These findings are consistent with current therapeutic strategies, as anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants. The model also predicted that fIX/FIXa activity is robust, which is supported by both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. The results support the working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades can be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. Preliminary simulations of simultaneous platelet activation and thrombin formation were consistent with the results of a cell-based coagulation assay, and the model is the first to simultaneously describe all 21 datasets, including coupled platelet and thrombin activation and the activity of three different anticoagulants, using minimal parameter variation.
The article presents a quantitative analysis of bacteriophage-host dynamics in an in vitro system using Campylobacter jejuni and a virulent phage. The study aims to understand the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions, which is crucial for the successful application of phage therapy. Phage therapy involves using bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic bacteria. The authors combine experimental and modeling approaches to examine the kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions and test a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model against in vitro data. The results show that even a simple model fits the data surprisingly well and confirms the importance of inundation and proliferation thresholds in phage therapy. These thresholds are critical parameters that determine the effectiveness of phage treatment. The study also highlights the emergence of phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni, which can lead to the resurgence of bacterial populations. The authors emphasize the need for a threshold-based understanding of phage-bacteria interactions for phage therapy. The study demonstrates the importance of combining empirical studies with kinetic models to gain a deeper understanding of phage therapy. The findings suggest that in vitro systems are essential for building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy. The study contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the non-linear kinetic properties of phages as self-replicating pharmaceuticals.
A novel Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) has been identified in the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomiasis, caused by S. mansoni, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The snail's immune response is essential for protecting against schistosome infection, but few specific snail immune factors have been identified and functionally characterized. This study reports the first functional characterization of a snail TLR, named BgTLR, which is involved in the cellular immune response of B. glabrata following challenge with S. mansoni. BgTLR was identified through a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins that differed in abundance between B. glabrata snails with different compatibility phenotypes to S. mansoni challenge. The S. mansoni-resistant strain of B. glabrata (BS-90) displayed higher levels of BgTLR compared to the susceptible (M-line) strain. Transcript expression of BgTLR was found to be highly responsive in BS-90 snails when challenged with S. mansoni, increasing 27-fold relative to a non-immune control gene. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails via targeted siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails. These results demonstrate that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that influences infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge.
In French Polynesia, Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes are primary vectors of infectious diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. To assess the risk of disease transmission and evaluate the efficacy of vector control programs, researchers developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect and quantify immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against salivary gland extracts (SGE) of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis in human populations. A cross-sectional study conducted in Tahiti and Moorea islands revealed that 98% and 68% of individuals had developed IgG antibodies against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, respectively. In contrast, 97% of individuals from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes, had no IgG antibodies against SGE of either mosquito species. The ELISA test showed no cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, indicating that the IgG response to salivary gland extracts is a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to the bites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. This new immuno-epidemiological tool is expected to enhance understanding of human exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas with high disease transmission risk, and evaluate the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings.
The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a pathogen is attributed to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of human macrophages. Research has shown that this adaptation involves interference with the metabolic machinery of the host cell. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in macrophages infected with differently virulent Mtb strains revealed that the pathogen targets a core subset of host reactions to integrate pathways facilitating macrophage survival with those promoting Mtb sustenance. This integration provides an axis where host- and pathogen-derived factors converge to define determinants of pathogenicity. The study found that the requirement for macrophage survival sensitizes TB susceptibility to the glycemic status of the individual, while mediation by the pathogen ensures that the virulence properties of the infecting strain contribute to the resulting pathology. The findings suggest that circulating glucose levels also contribute to pathogenicity by influencing macrophage apoptosis, revealing an additional facet to the relationship between diabetes and TB. The study highlights the importance of metabolic intervention in dictating the pathology of TB, supporting a reevaluation of existing paradigms for understanding Mtb pathogenicity. The research provides new insights into the complex interplay between host and pathogen, and has implications for the development of effective vaccines and treatments against TB.
ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, plays a crucial role in crossover recombination during meiosis. The protein's localization is highly dynamic, shifting from along the length of the synaptonemal complex (SC) to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. A zhp-3::gfp transgene partially complements a null mutation, revealing a separation of function: while the fusion protein promotes nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. The smo-1 mutants exhibit phenotypes similar to zhp-3::gfp mutants at higher temperatures, and smo-1; zhp-3::gfp double mutants exhibit more severe meiotic defects than either single mutant, consistent with a role for SUMO in the process of SC disassembly and bivalent differentiation. The study proposes that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. The identification of ZHP-3 and/or SUMO targets on meiotic chromosomes will refine our understanding of how chromosome structure is remodeled to accompany reciprocal exchange.
Aedes albopictus, a tropical invasive mosquito species, has become a public health concern in temperate regions of Europe and the US due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and cause nuisance problems. This study investigated the effects of eco-climatic factors on the abundance and dynamics of Ae. albopictus in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and is now one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. Longitudinal adult monitoring was conducted along a 70 km transect across and beyond the metropolitan area, and two fine-scale spatiotemporal datasets were analyzed to examine the impact of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics.

The results showed that highly anthropized habitats were associated with high adult abundance in both metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with "small green islands" corresponding to hotspots of abundance in metropolitan areas only. A bimodal seasonal dynamics was observed, with a second peak of abundance in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. The study found that an increase in vegetation cover was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments. The results suggest that public mosquito control measures should be prioritized in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are higher, and highlight potential public health risks after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.
The study investigated the role of phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( DIM ) in the invasion of macrophages by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ). DIM are major virulence factors of Mtb, particularly during the early stages of infection. Using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis, the researchers found that DIM participate in both receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. The effects of DIM required a state of membrane fluidity, as demonstrated by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells showed that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb, while the lateral diffusion of cholesterol remained unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with the effect observed following DIM insertion in model membranes. The study proposes that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organization in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favor the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH, creating a protective niche for the bacteria. The study highlights the importance of DIM in the pathogenesis of Mtb and provides new insights into the mechanisms of Mtb invasion of host cells.
The article presents a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of small neural networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. The authors develop a method to study the local and global bifurcations of neural activity in these networks, which is largely analytically tractable. They find that for strong inhibition, these networks exhibit complex dynamics due to the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This phenomenon is a finite-size effect of the network and reveals qualitative differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The most significant consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reduce the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The authors extend previous work on the analysis of small neural networks by deriving exact expressions of the bifurcation manifolds and relaxing the constraints on synaptic weights. Their method allows for the study of networks composed of a few tens of neurons, which is the lower bound of the mesoscopic scale. The results provide new insights into the dynamics of small neural networks and highlight the importance of considering finite-size effects in the study of neural circuits.
This study investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites of patients with dermal leishmaniasis. To determine the viability of parasites, the researchers used Leishmania 7SLRNA as a target for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The results showed that Leishmania 7SLRNA genes and transcripts were detected in extralesional tissues, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, in 100% and 73% of patients, respectively. The copy number of 7SLRNA transcripts was correlated with the dose and time-dependent reduction of parasite viability in response to Glucantime, confirming the validity of this target as a marker of viability. The study also found that 7SLRNA transcripts were most frequently detected in monocytes, followed by tonsil swabs and healthy skin aspirates. The detection and quantification of parasites in extralesional tissues are important for determining the status of infection, monitoring treatment, and resolving gaps in the understanding of the natural history of human infection. The study demonstrated that amplification of 7SLRNA transcripts detects the presence of live parasites, allowing for a parasitological diagnosis to be achieved. The findings suggest that viable Leishmania parasites are present in extralesional sites, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, during active dermal leishmaniasis, and that Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis.
The study investigated the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila using a comprehensive data collection of 95 chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) and histone modifications (HMs). A quantitative statistical model was developed to predict DNA replication timing based on linear combinations of chromatin features. The results showed that combinations of HMs and their pairwise interactions are key to achieving accurate predictions, suggesting that combinatorial HM patterns contribute to the regulation of DNA replication timing. The model was able to predict replication timing with high accuracy genome-wide and across cell types, reaching 80% of the full model accuracy using six model terms. Independent feature importance and model analyses led to the derivation of a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication timing. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that pairwise combinations of HMs can predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. The findings provide support for the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and reveal cell-type independent key elements thereof, which may contribute to elucidating the regulatory mode of this fundamental cellular process.
Title: Air Travel Is Associated with Intracontinental Spread of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1–3 in Brazil

    Dengue virus, which infects 390 million people annually and causes at least 25,000 deaths, is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. This study investigated the spatial dynamics of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil by analyzing complete genome sequences. The results indicate that new lineages of these serotypes are introduced to Brazil approximately every 7-10 years, with the Caribbean region being the primary source of these introductions. The new lineages then disperse at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day.

    A statistical analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data suggests that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, is the primary driver of dengue virus spread in Brazil. The study used 178 Brazilian genome sequences to determine the factors underlying dengue virus dispersal on a countrywide scale. The results indicate that air travel plays a significant role in the spread of dengue virus within Brazil, with periodic dengue serotype-specific peaks in incidence coinciding with the introduction of new lineages every 7-10 years. The study highlights the importance of air traffic fluxes in the spatial spread of dengue virus within Brazil and underscores the need for caution when making predictions about viral emergence.
The study investigated how differences in receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. The researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiology to examine the relationship between RF structure and correlated neural activity. Contrary to predictions based on RF center size and overlap, the study found that electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this result, the researchers incorporated the effects of RF surround in their model and found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. The study suggests that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity. The results show that the sign and magnitude of correlations are largely determined by the relative strength of positively and negatively correlated inputs. The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of RF surround in understanding neural correlations and provides new insights into the neural code. The findings have implications for understanding how sensory information is encoded and processed in the brain.
The Sign Rule and Beyond: Boundary Effects, Flexibility, and Noise Correlations in Neural Population Codes provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of noise correlations on population coding in sensory neurons. The study investigates how coding performance varies as a function of noise correlations, with all other aspects of the problem held constant. The results yield unifying insights into the role of noise correlations, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with diverse tuning curves. The main contributions of the study are threefold. First, the sign rule (SR) is generalized to prove that if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs compared to their signal correlations, coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. Second, the SR is shown to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for good coding, and a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding, many of which violate the SR. Third, a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions is provided under which coding performance will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all. The study provides a general mathematical setup that makes no assumptions about the shapes or heterogeneity of neural tuning curves or variances in neural responses, offering insights into the problem of population coding.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoproducts play a significant role in determining the efficacy of antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus in chronic coinfections. A study investigated the impact of P. aeruginosa on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility using a panel of P. aeruginosa burn wound and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung isolates. The results showed that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner. The study identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus: P. aeruginosa LasA endopeptidase potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, rhamnolipids facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) induces multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. The production of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that vancomycin treatment of a S. aureus mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of a LasA-producing P. aeruginosa population. These findings suggest that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only on the genotype of the pathogen being targeted but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment. The study highlights the importance of considering these interactions to improve the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which can contribute to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. Two observational cohort studies conducted in Indonesia investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection. The studies found that adult patients with DENV had higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and active VWF, and that circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in DENV patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. The data demonstrate that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in DENV results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. The study suggests that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection. Platelet sialylation was not altered by in vitro exposure of platelets to DENV nonstructural protein 1 or cultured DENV. The binding of VWF to glycoprotein 1b on platelets using the VWF-activating protein ristocetin resulted in the removal of platelet sialic acid by translocation of platelet neuraminidase to the platelet surface.
A comprehensive annotation of bidirectional promoters in the human genome has been conducted to identify co-regulation among breast and ovarian cancer genes. Bidirectional promoters are regulatory regions that control the expression of two adjacent genes with transcription start sites directed away from each other. The study used a database of spliced-expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) to identify the most complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters. A rigorous screen of the spliced EST data revealed new bidirectional promoters, many of which functioned as alternative promoters or regulated novel transcripts. The analysis showed a highly significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, the study verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. Subsets of these promoters contained similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. The study suggests that bidirectional promoters may regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes, and that misregulation of these promoters could play a pivotal role in cancer development. The findings have implications for understanding the molecular events that contribute to disease, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers.
Title: Numerous Transitions of Sex Chromosomes in Diptera
    Summary: 
    A comprehensive genomic analysis of 37 fly species across 22 Diptera families reveals a striking diversity of sex chromosome configurations. While Diptera flies typically exhibit XY sex chromosomes and a conserved karyotype, the study uncovers over a dozen distinct sex chromosome arrangements. The small dot chromosome is found to be the sex chromosome in many species, suggesting it is the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. However, some species exhibit undifferentiated sex chromosomes, while others have a different chromosome replacing the dot as the sex chromosome or have up to three chromosomal elements incorporated into the sex chromosomes. Additionally, some species display female heterogamety ( ZW sex chromosomes ). Transcriptome analysis indicates that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies through the up-regulation of the single X chromosome in males. Furthermore, X chromosomes show a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression, possibly due to sex-specific selective pressures. These findings provide a rich resource for studying sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and demonstrate that similar selective forces have shaped the evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa. The study suggests that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times over the course of Diptera evolution, highlighting the dynamic nature of sex chromosome evolution in flies.
The study investigated the presence of Zika virus (ZIKV) antibodies in mothers from Hawaii who delivered babies with and without microcephaly between 2009 and 2012. Blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies were tested for ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available ELISA kits. The results showed that one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody (16.6%), and three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody (50%). ZIKV IgG antibody-positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies, with an odds ratio of 11.0 (95% CI = 0.8-147.9, p = 0.083). Similarly, ZIKV IgM antibody-positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgM antibody, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% CI = 0.2-195.1, p = 0.333). These findings provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and suggest that ZIKV-positive cases and associated microcephaly may have occurred in the United States as early as 2009. The study's results are consistent with previous reports of ZIKV outbreaks in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa.
The study aimed to source-track Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections in the Ashanti Region, Ghana, by matching Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four Buruli ulcer (BU) endemic communities. Four VNTR loci in the MU Agy99 genome were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. The results showed that MU was present in three different types of water bodies, with significantly higher levels in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes (W, X, Y, and Z) were typed in both human and environmental samples, while other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified one mouse with a lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as an MU infection. The study suggests that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies and that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. The findings indicate that M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains. The study highlights the importance of considering the environmental component in understanding the transmission of MU infections.
The global distribution and drivers of alien bird species richness were investigated using an extensive database of 27,723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide. The study found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds were initially driven by European colonialism, mainly from Britain, but recent introductions involve more species and countries and are driven by increasing economic activity. The results show that alien bird species richness is highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, particularly the number of species introduced, known as colonisation pressure. Environmental drivers also play a significant role, with native and alien species richness being positively associated. The study demonstrates that colonisation pressure is a key factor in understanding alien species richness and that areas with high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale. The findings highlight the ongoing threats to global environments from species introductions. The study used a combination of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of alien species richness and found that both human and biotic factors influence global patterns of alien species richness in birds. The results provide new insights into the global distribution of alien bird species and the drivers of their richness.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-HMGB-box protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I (RPI/PolI). Previous studies have shown that UBF is essential for the recruitment of the pre-initiation complex SL1/TIF1B and the active epigenetic state of rRNA genes. However, its role in RPI transcription has been questioned due to its poor DNA sequence selectivity and ability to form nucleosome-like nucleoprotein complexes.

    Conditional deletion of UBF in mouse embryos revealed that it is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage. In cell cultures, conditional deletion of UBF showed that it is required for rRNA gene transcription and defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevents the formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex, and is accompanied by the recruitment of H3K9me3, canonical histone H1, and HP1α.

    Unexpectedly, genes retain penta-acetyl H4 and H2A.Z, suggesting that even in the absence of UBF, rRNA genes can maintain a potentially active state. In contrast to canonical histone H1, binding of H1.4 is dependent on UBF, indicating a positive role in gene activity. Loss of UBF also induces the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and early embryos, which contains rRNA synthesis and processing factors but does not associate with the rRNA gene loci (NORs).
This study investigates the role of Wingless/Wnt (Wg) signaling in adult intestinal compartmentalization in Drosophila. Contrary to the conventional model, which suggests that Wg secretion and movement are essential for long-range signaling in tissue patterning, the authors found that a membrane-tethered form of Wg produced viable adults with largely normal external morphology, indicating that Wg secretion and movement may be dispensable for tissue patterning. However, further investigation in the adult intestine revealed that the critical roles of Wg during adult intestinal development, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway, are all disrupted by Wg tethering. These findings provide new evidence that supports the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wg in tissue patterning. The study highlights the importance of Wg signaling gradients in the adult intestine, which demarcate all major boundaries between compartments, and suggests that Wg movement is critical for proper Wg pathway activation during adult gut development. The results have implications for our understanding of animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease, and may uncover general principles that determine the contexts in which the long-range action of Wnt is essential.
The study investigated the role of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in the pathogenesis of invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. It was found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. Furthermore, GAS were able to mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. A previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed to assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/− mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system (T4SS) components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface. The cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) encodes components of the T4SS that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, CagI, and CagH are specialized components of the cag T4SS that bind the host receptor α5β1 integrin and are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI. These proteins are detectable on the bacterial surface and are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. A ΔcagI and ΔcagL mutant strain fails to form pili, whereas a ΔcagH mutant strain exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype and produces pili that are elongated and thickened compared to those of the wild-type strain. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL, and deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili. These results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis and highlight the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. To develop a long-term solution for controlling the disease, researchers have prioritized the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB. A recent study aimed to identify host correlates of protection by analyzing the global gene transcriptome of vaccinated cattle. Calves were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol, and their protective efficacy was determined after Mycobacterium bovis challenge. The study found that 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared to vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset, with interleukin-22 (IL-22) expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection, alongside interferon-gamma (INF-γ). The importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy was further confirmed by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. These findings suggest that IL-22 plays a crucial role in protection against bTB and may serve as a biomarker for predicting vaccine efficacy. This study contributes to the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB and highlights the potential of IL-22 as a predictive biomarker for vaccine success.
In Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells, non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) play a crucial role in regulating microtubule organization and dynamics. The γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora A are essential centrosomal microtubule nucleators that localize to the apical ncMTOC. The core γ-TuRC component GIP-1/GCP3 is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components, including MZT-1/MZT1, to the apical ncMTOC. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZT-1 are specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to centrioles or the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remain robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion, and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators. However, loss of GIP-1 removes a subset of dynamic EBP-2/EB1–marked microtubules, and the remaining dynamic microtubules grow faster. These results suggest that different microtubule organizing centers use discrete proteins for their function, and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.
Title: Comparison of Phasing Strategies for Whole Human Genomes
    A study compared 11 different approaches to phasing human genomes, which involves determining the origin of maternal and paternal chromosomes. Most human sequencing initiatives do not directly phase the genome due to costs and complexities. The study used the Genome-In-A-Bottle (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of various phasing strategies. The approaches included laboratory-based assays and computational methods that reconstruct phase information from sequencing reads and population-level haplotype frequency information.

    The study assessed the performance of the 11 approaches using metrics such as switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, and phasing accuracy. The results suggest that a hybrid approach combining population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. The inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. A majority voting scheme for constructing a consensus haplotype combining multiple predictions was also considered for enhanced performance and site coverage. The study identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, including regions of low polymorphism or SNV density. The results indicate that hybrid computational approaches to phasing a single genome are accurate and cost-effective, nearly matching or surpassing laboratory-based approaches.
This study investigated the role of ATPase activity in the type-III protein secretion system of Salmonella enterica. Type-III protein secretion systems are used by gram-negative pathogens to secrete proteins into host cells. The flagellar type-III secretion apparatus utilizes both the proton motive force (PMF) and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. The study found that mutations that increased the PMF and flagellar substrate levels allowed for the formation of functional flagella in the absence of type-III ATPase activity. Additionally, increased PMF bypassed the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. These results suggest that ATPase activity is not universally required for protein export via type-III secretion systems. The study proposes that the function of the T3SS-associated ATPase complex is to deliver secretion substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding. The findings have important implications for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and type-III secretion systems. The study demonstrates that type-III protein secretion can occur efficiently in the absence of ATPase activity, revealing the dispensability of ATPase activity in the type-III protein export process.
The emergence of switch-like behavior in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial for various biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, determining the network topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge due to the vast variety of GRNs for a small number of components. A comprehensive in silico survey using chemical reaction network theory was conducted to investigate the capacity for bistability in over 40,000 simple networks formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. The analysis revealed that approximately 90% of these GRN models can exhibit bistability for certain reaction rate constants, including several circuits without transcription factor cooperativity. A topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks identified eleven minimal bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. These findings suggest that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. The systematic application of chemical reaction network theory to bistable network identification in real biological systems was demonstrated by integrating publicly available data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, predicting several GRNs to behave in a bistable fashion. The study highlights the potential of this approach to provide hypotheses for further experimentation and guidance for systems with available interaction data.
Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, have been identified as a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting in humans and mice. Hyaluronidase 2 is responsible for degrading extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The study found that mutations in HYAL2 lead to reduced levels of the enzyme, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, in both humans and mice. Additionally, cor triatriatum sinister and hearing loss were identified as incompletely penetrant features in affected humans and mice, respectively. The study highlights the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes in human and mouse development and reveals a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister. The findings demonstrate that a deficiency of the HA-degrading enzyme HYAL2 is a novel cause of syndromic orofacial clefting in humans and submucosal cleft palate in mice, and define the first molecular explanation for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. The study provides evidence of the importance of HYAL2 for normal heart development in humans and mice, and identifies mutation of HYAL2 as the first described molecular mechanism for cor triatriatum sinister in humans.
The regeneration of mechanosensory tip links in auditory hair cells is essential for sound detection in the inner ear. Current models propose a static composition of the tip link, consisting of protocadherin 15 ( PCDH15 ) at the lower end and cadherin 23 ( CDH23 ) at the upper end. However, this study reveals that functional tip links can have at least two molecular compositions : PCDH15/CDH23 and PCDH15/PCDH15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first and mediate mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2+-dependent decay. The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. This two-step molecular remodeling process may underlie the formation of tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation. The study used a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize immuno-gold particles and stereocilia links of only a few nanometers in diameter. The findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). To understand the mechanisms that trigger the transition from DF to DHF, researchers conducted a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical and recovery phases of infection. The study identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF patients at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Notably, bile acids were found to be up to 5-fold higher in DHF patients compared to DF patients, and were correlated with liver injury markers aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in the blood, was observed to be 1.5-fold lower in DHF patients, suggesting a decreased capacity for endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained significantly altered in DHF patients, indicating a potential prolonged adverse impact on the liver due to DENV infection. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis and identifies altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF, which may serve as novel therapeutic targets for dengue management.
The study identifies and characterizes the guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis. The GMPR enzyme catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 5’-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP), playing a crucial role in maintaining the intracellular balance of purine nucleotides. The researchers found that the GMPR protein in T. brucei is localized to glycosomes and possesses a unique insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain, which is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR exhibits distinct enzymatic properties compared to its mammalian counterparts, including different affinities for GMP and NADPH, and is activated by the addition of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+. Furthermore, the study shows that the monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibits T. brucei GMPR activity. The results suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is distinct from that in host organisms. The study also demonstrates the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the potential of ribavirin as a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Sodium channel blockers are used to control electrical excitability in cells as a treatment for conditions such as epileptic seizures and cardiac arrhythmia. To develop the next generation of drugs that can selectively target one of the nine types of voltage-gated sodium channels expressed in the body, a better understanding of how current channel blockers work is required. This study used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the position at which the sodium channel blocking drugs benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the protein NavAb, a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel. The results show that both drugs have two likely binding sites in the pore, characterized by nonspecific, hydrophobic interactions: one just above the activation gate and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. Three independent methods found the same sites, suggesting that binding to the activation gate is slightly more favorable than at the fenestration. The study also found that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with only small energy barriers, suggesting that this can represent the long-postulated hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. The simulations highlight the importance of a number of residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration, and in forming the drug binding sites. These findings provide new insights into the mode of action of sodium channel inhibitors and have implications for the development of new drugs that can selectively target one of the nine types of voltage-gated sodium channels expressed in the body.
The study investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in specific cell types during intestinal infection with Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium). MyD88 is a key adaptor molecule in the Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling pathways, which are essential for inducing protective host responses against bacterial infections. However, the cell type-specific contribution of MyD88 to intestinal immunity against C. rodentium was poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the authors employed a novel mouse model that allowed for the cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in MyD88-deficient mice. The results showed that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) was sufficient to activate intestinal DCs, induce the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response, and promote the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to C. rodentium infection. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to macrophages, T cells, or ILC3 did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses. Notably, the study also found that MyD88 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) partially protected mice during intestinal infection, associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins. These findings suggest that MyD88 signaling in DCs and IECs is essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses against C. rodentium infection.
The article explores the use of anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibody prevalence as an indicator for evaluating and making decisions in onchocerciasis elimination programmes. Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). An immunodiagnostic test based on the detection of human IgG4 antibodies to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16 is recommended for determining whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop. A mathematical model, ONCHOSIM, was extended to include output on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals. The model assumes that seroconversion is triggered by the first worm establishing in the host, with seroconversion occurring before maturation, after maturation, or only after the start of microfilariae (mf) production. The study investigates the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children, measured one year after the last round of MDA, and the duration and coverage of MDA, mf prevalence in the population, and the probability that onchocerciasis is eventually eliminated. The results show that both mf prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and precise estimation of the endpoint for MDA.
The study investigated the acquisition of drug resistance and dependence by prions, misfolded proteins that can cause neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers found that prion strains can change their properties when propagated in different environments. For example, when swainsonine-sensitive 22L prions were propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of swainsonine, drug-resistant variants emerged. This suggests that prions constitute quasi-populations comprising a range of variants with different properties, from which the fittest are selected in a particular environment. The study also showed that prion populations developed heterogeneity even after biological cloning, indicating that mutation-like processes occur at the conformational level.

The researchers investigated whether it was possible to select swainsonine-resistant variants of RML prions, which are naturally swainsonine-sensitive. They found that this was not possible with the standard line of PK1 cells, but in certain PK1 sublines, swainsonine-resistant and even swainsonine-dependent populations could be isolated. These populations could be passaged indefinitely in PK1 cells, even in the absence of the drug, without losing swainsonine dependence. The misfolded prion protein associated with a swainsonine-dependent variant was less rapidly cleared in PK1 cells than that associated with its drug-sensitive counterpart, indicating that structural differences of the misfolded PrP underlie the properties of the prions.

The study suggests that propagation of prions in the presence of an inhibitory drug may not only cause the selection of drug-resistant prions but also of stable variants that propagate more efficiently in the presence of the drug. These adaptations are most likely due to conformational changes of the abnormal prion protein.
The study exhaustively analyzed a genotype-phenotype map for a space of 1015 metabolisms that encodes all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism. Using flux balance analysis, the researchers predicted the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. The analysis revealed that although viable metabolisms with any one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, their absolute numbers exceed 109 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space, where any two genotypes can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. The minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, allowing for the potential to reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes – viable on new carbon sources – through one or few genotypic changes. The study also found that increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and evolutionary innovation. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the neighborhoods of different metabolisms viable on the same carbon source contain different novel phenotypes, which may depend on where in metabolic genotype space a viable metabolism is located.
The study analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex, a group of triatomine bugs that transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, across the Mexican Neotropics. The researchers analyzed two fragments of the ND4 gene and found that the lowest genetic diversity of T. dimidiata occurs in areas with high historical anthropic modification, where T. cruzi infection prevalence is also highest. The study identified three haplogroups (1, 2, and 3) with differential Trypanosoma cruzi and Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) infections. Haplogroups 1 and 3 had higher T. cruzi prevalence than expected, while haplogroup 2 had lower prevalence. The researchers also found significant differences in DTU infection frequencies between haplogroups 1 and 3, but not in haplogroup 2. The study estimated the divergence of the complex from its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) to be between 0.97 and 0.85 million years ago (MYA), with primary divergence of haplogroups 2 and 3. The effective population size of Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased between 0.02 and 0.03 MYA. The study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complex's origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus and provides evidence for recent divergence of the three primary dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, which are important components of vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease primarily caused by two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), in China. Environmental factors significantly influence the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, mainly through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. A 10-year (2006-2015) field surveillance study in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot, aimed to clarify the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission. The study analyzed 709 cases of HFRS, rodent species, and environmental data from satellite images and meteorological stations to quantify the relationships among environmental factors, rodent species, and HFRS occurrence. The results showed that rodent species played different roles across various land types, with all species associated with transmission risks. Rattus norvegicus and R. flavipectus were associated with HFRS risk in grassland, while M. musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability. Predictive risk models based on these significant factors were validated, indicating that cultivated land represented the highest risk for HFRS incidence. The study suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments.
Activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene can cause Costello syndrome (CS), a congenital disease characterized by growth retardation, tumor predisposition, and developmental delay. The majority of CS cases are caused by heterozygous c.34G>A (p.Gly12Ser) mutations in HRAS. However, a new germline p.Gly12Val mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, was identified in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of the HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping, which was confirmed using wild-type and mutant HRAS minigenes. The mutation was found to disrupt the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and create an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), leading to exon 2 skipping. The splicing efficiency of HRAS exon 2 is dependent on the binding of splicing stimulatory proteins, such as SRSF2, to the critical ESE. The majority of cancer- and CS-causing mutations are located in exon 2 and affect splicing differently. The phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. A splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE was shown to cause exon 2 skipping and halt the proliferation of cancer cells, suggesting a potential for the development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.
The study investigated the role of METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in mammalian cerebellar development. METTL3 is a key factor in the formation of m6A, the most abundant modification on mRNAs. Researchers found that specific inactivation of Mettl3 in the mouse nervous system caused severe developmental defects in the brain, resulting in cerebellar hypoplasia. This was due to drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) in the external granular layer (EGL). METTL3 depletion led to loss of m6A modification, causing extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, which in turn resulted in dysregulation of transcriptome-wide gene expression and premature CGC death. The study revealed that METTL3 is an essential regulator of cerebellar neurogenesis and development. Transcriptome-wide gene expression dysregulation induced by m6A depletion in the absence of METTL3 resulted in CGCs apoptosis and cerebellum hypoplasia. The findings indicate that METTL3-mediated m6A serves as a key regulator in modulating the development of the central nervous system at the post-transcriptional level in mammals. The study suggests that METTL3 plays a critical role in regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum, and its dysregulation can lead to severe cerebellar developmental defects.
The study investigated the role of combinatorial binding of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. These transcription factors are essential for maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells and their ability to differentiate into any cell type of the developing embryo. The researchers found that combinatorial binding of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG is strongly associated with the co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. Furthermore, they observed that the same loci bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. A comparison of mouse and human ES cells revealed that while less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are shared between species, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. These findings suggest that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. The study also suggests that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, whereas "gene regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints.
The AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor, generated by a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21, plays a crucial role in the initiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. AML1/ETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by directly targeting AML1 binding sites. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling revealed that AML1/ETO co-localizes with AML1, demonstrating that the fusion protein follows the binding pattern of the wild-type protein but does not function primarily by displacing it. The DNA binding profile of the E-protein HEB was grossly rearranged upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the fusion protein was found to co-localize with both AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO. The results suggest a major role for the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein. AML1/ETO was found to target DNA through E-box motifs as a result of physical interactions with transcription factors of the E-protein family, particularly HEB/TCF12. The co-occurrence of AML1 and HEB is significantly associated with regulation of gene expression by AML1/ETO, suggesting that common binding regions for the three transcription factors are relevant to AML1/ETO function.
The study investigated the role of Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferase 2 (HAT2) in regulating cell cycle progression. HAT2 was found to acetylate histone H4K10 in vitro and in vivo, and its depletion resulted in growth and cell cycle defects, as well as poor survival in host cells. Real-time PCR and DNA microarray analyses revealed that downregulation of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9 were responsible for S phase and G2/M defects in HAT2-depleted cells, respectively. Reporter assays showed that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, which were activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and nuclear run-on analyses confirmed that CYC4 and CYC9 were transcriptionally activated from their own promoters at specific cell cycle stages. The study suggests that there are two tiers of gene regulation in Leishmania donovani: transcription of polycistronic units primarily initiates at divergent strand switch regions (dSSRs) constitutively, while a subset of genes have their own promoters that are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This second tier of regulation is more sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels, resulting in downregulation of expression in HAT2-depleted cells. The study provides new insights into gene regulation in Leishmania donovani and highlights the importance of stringent modulation of CYC4 and CYC9 expression in cell cycle progression.
The study investigated how humans infer on the intentions of others during social interactions using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework. In an economic game, 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, with one participant receiving additional information and issuing a recommendation. The game was structured to vary the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information over time. The results showed that the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, where they inferred the volatility of the adviser's intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of the advice. The players' estimates of volatility also affected their trial-by-trial variability in decisions, with participants relying more on their estimates of advice accuracy when they believed the adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. The study suggests that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts, which may be useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition. The study also found that players who interacted with advisers whose intentions were changing to maximize their own winnings showed more pronounced values, indicating a stronger coupling between the two hierarchical learning levels.
The article reports on the urbanization of scrub typhus disease in South Korea, specifically in Seoul, the largest metropolitan city. Scrub typhus, an endemic disease in Asia, has traditionally been considered a rural disease. However, indigenous urban cases have been observed in Seoul, which may have significant public health implications due to the city's large population. Using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013, the study identified 88 cases of urban scrub typhus in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas, city parks, the vicinity of one's own residence, and riversides. Chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites, and 87.4% of them were identified as Helenicula miyagawai, which was found to be infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. The clinical features of the patients were mild, with low APACHE II scores and low complication rates. The study suggests that urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases in endemic areas and a target for prevention. The presence of the Boryong genotype in the chigger mites collected within Seoul was confirmed, and further identification of causative strains from multiple areas will help to characterize the overall status of the disease. The study highlights the possibility that scrub typhus can spread into urban areas under high incidence pressure from surrounding areas.
The study investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA-methyl-transferase homolog, HENN-1, in the stability and function of two endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathways: the 26G and 21U pathways. HENN-1 is involved in the methylation of the 3' ends of small RNA (sRNA) molecules, which is crucial for their stability. The results show that HENN-1 has differential effects on the two pathways. In the germline, the stability of 21U RNAs, which are the Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, is only mildly affected by the loss of methylation. In contrast, most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and increased 3'-uridylation frequencies in the absence of HENN-1. Furthermore, the study found that specifically ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4-bound 26G RNAs are not. Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants revealed mild effects, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes. The study suggests that the effects of reduced 26G RNA levels on gene expression are indirect, and that HENN-1 plays a crucial role in the stabilization of ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs. These findings refine our understanding of endogenous RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans and the roles of Hen1-like enzymes in these pathways.
Title: Genomics Meets Glycomics—The First GWAS Study of Human N-Glycome Identifies HNF1α as a Master Regulator of Plasma Protein Fucosylation

    A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts revealed that common variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. The study found that HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α regulate the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, HNF1α was shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. This mechanism has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The study highlights a new role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process. HNF1α and HNF4α were found to regulate the expression of fucosyltransferase genes, including FUT6 and FUT8, and the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, a rate-limiting step in protein fucosylation. These findings provide new insights into the complex processes that regulate glycosylation and have significant implications for our understanding of various diseases.
This study investigated the role of single-stranded RNA in stabilizing the DNA binding of Centromere Protein C (CENPC), a key inner kinetochore protein in maize. CENPC plays a crucial role in the attachment of chromosomes to the cytoskeleton during cell division. The researchers found that a localized region of 122 amino acids in CENPC is responsible for DNA binding, and that this binding is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long, single-stranded nucleic acids strongly promote the binding of CENPC to DNA, and the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match in size and character the RNAs present on kinetochores in vivo. The data suggest that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. The study used a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies to show that maize CENPC has both DNA-binding and RNA-binding capacities, and that the DNA/RNA-binding domain is localized to the exon duplication region. The researchers propose that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA. These findings support the view that RNA facilitates or stabilizes the association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA and implicate CENPC as a primary target of this activity.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified genetic variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and childhood body mass index (CBMI). The study examined the role of the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in mediating the genetic causes of these traits. The results showed that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were significantly enriched for placental eQTLs, with 6.76, 4.83, and 2.26-fold enrichments, respectively. Notably, only placental eQTLs contributed significantly to both anthropometric outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). The study identified eight, six, and one transcripts that colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. The findings suggest that placental transcription in utero plays a key role in determining postnatal body size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. The study highlights the importance of the placenta as a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, and demonstrates that integrative genomics can be a powerful tool for mining GWAS results to understand the mechanisms controlling these traits. The results also support the hypothesis that genetically controlled in utero expression patterns linked to BW, CO, and CBMI are important for understanding the mechanisms controlling these traits and developing clinical prevention strategies.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic condition that occurs in approximately 10-20% of patients who have successfully treated Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in India, and up to 50-60% in Sudan. PKDL is a dermal manifestation characterized by macular, maculopapular, or nodular rash caused by Leishmania donovani. Unlike VL, PKDL is not life-threatening, but it is highly relevant in the context of VL elimination. A study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India, aimed to determine the actual disease burden of PKDL, compare three diagnostic tools for PKDL case detection, and assess the pattern of lesion regression after treatment. The study found a prevalence rate of 27.5% among antileishmanial antibody-positive cases. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was found to be highly sensitive (88.46%) for case confirmation. However, skin lesions persisted in most cases after treatment completion, gradually disappearing within 6-12 months post-treatment. Reappearance of lesions was noted in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. The study suggests that a significant number of PKDL patients would remain undiagnosed without active mass surveys, highlighting the need for such surveys in other endemic areas to attain the ultimate goal of eliminating Kala-azar. A well-designed study with a higher number of samples is essential to establish whether PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and to determine which PKDL patients need treatment for a longer period.
Pneumococcal Competence Coordination Relies on a Cell-Contact Sensing Mechanism

    A recent study has elucidated the mechanisms underlying pneumococcal competence development in liquid cultures of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Competence is an inducible genetic program that enables horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in pneumococci. The study found that competence development in pneumococcal populations is a two-step process, initiated by a self-activated cell fraction that arises via a growth time-dependent mechanism. This fraction of cells over-expresses the Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), which then induces competence in the rest of the population through cell-to-cell contact.

    The study demonstrated that CSP remains bound to cells during competence development and that the rate of competence development corresponds to the propagation of competence by contact between activated and quiescent cells. The researchers also found that the membrane protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its free diffusion in the medium. This suggests that competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a distinct subpopulation that then transmits CSP by cell-cell contact.

    The study proposes a cell-contact sensing mechanism for pneumococcal competence development, where a fraction of cells initially switches to CSP over-expression and then induces competence in the rest of the population through cell-to-cell contact. This mechanism promotes horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in pneumococci, contributing to their ability to evade vaccines, antibiotics, and host immune defenses. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying pneumococcal competence development and highlights the importance of cell-to-cell contact in this process.
The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2 protein acts as a chaperone to facilitate the trafficking of the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where HPV replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/vDNA complex must translocate across limiting intracellular membranes. A novel system based on subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate was developed to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. The results show that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN, and only release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis, with vDNA egressing from the TGN to a pericentriolar location and accumulating there through prometaphase. By metaphase and throughout anaphase, the vDNA is seen bound to the mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 potently blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase. This represents the first time a virus has been shown to functionally couple the penetration of limiting membranes to cellular mitosis, explaining in part the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes.
The article presents a mathematical framework for estimating the relative transmissibility (transmission fitness) of one strain of a pathogen compared to another using data from competitive mixtures animal models. The framework is applied to influenza experiments in ferrets, where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains, and the mixture is observed over time and multiple generations of transmission. The method assesses the relative transmissibility between two strains of influenza, which is crucial in various contexts, including seasonal/seasonal interactions, seasonal/pandemic interactions, and NAI-resistant/NAI-sensitive interactions. The framework also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum. The authors demonstrate the framework's behavior using data from ferret transmission studies and suggest how to optimize experimental design for assessing transmissibility. The method has wide applicability in influenza research and can be extended to other viral and bacterial pathogens. The framework indicates potential improvements in competitive-mixtures experimental design, including the use of multiple donor ferrets and the estimation of the number of successfully infecting units transferred from the donor to the recipient. This information is essential for parameterizing epidemiological models of influenza transmission that consider the emergence and spread of NAI-resistant strains.
This study investigates the convergence of light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling on the ABI5 promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana. The authors show that BBX21, a B-box protein previously implicated in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Genetic data indicate that BBX21 acts upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in ABA control of seed germination. The study reveals that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. Additionally, ABI5 was found to directly activate its own expression, and BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. The results suggest that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA, which is essential for plant adaptation and survival. The findings indicate that multiple transcription factors in the light signaling pathway may regulate ABA responses by regulating ABI5 expression. The study highlights the importance of understanding how plants integrate external signals with internal regulatory pathways to respond to environmental cues.
The Mediator complex is a conserved co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that plays a crucial role in eukaryotic gene expression. This study investigated the functions of the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus. The researchers focused on the Middle domain subunit Med31, the Head domain subunit Med20, and Srb9/Med13 from the Kinase domain. They found that the C. albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, including functions in stress response and the regulation of genes by the activator Ace2. However, the C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of virulence-related genes, such as those involved in morphogenesis and the expression of cell wall adhesins. The Mediator subunits Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, including filamentation and biofilm formation. Furthermore, Med31 affects the virulence of C. albicans in a worm infection model. The study also found that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of cell wall adhesins differ between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, suggesting distinct Mediator-dependent control of adhesion in these two yeast species. These findings provide new insights into the functions of the Mediator complex in C. albicans and its role in shaping species-specific gene expression.
The fitness landscape of antibiotic tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms was investigated using genome-wide functional profiling of a complex mutant population in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions with and without tobramycin. The study aimed to quantify the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance under these two states. The results revealed large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only, providing insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance. A mixed population-based experimental design was used to recapitulate the complexity of natural biofilms and revealed clinically observed behaviors, including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. The study found that the cellular state contributes substantially to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections. The results showed that while there is a considerable overlap between the loci that modulate antibiotic tolerance in biofilm and planktonic cells, the relative importance of most genes is state-specific. For example, the vast majority of mutants with the strongest fitness advantages in the biofilm state also have only a weak to moderate advantage in the planktonic state. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance in P. aeruginosa biofilms and planktonic cells.
A new algorithm called Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FAMoS) has been developed to analyze complex systems dynamics in large model spaces. The algorithm is designed to overcome the challenges of analyzing biological systems with many interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. FAMoS uses a combination of local and non-local search methods to prevent getting stuck in local minima of the model space. The algorithm was tested and validated using simulated data and shown to be flexible in handling different model structures. It was also applied to experimental data on cell proliferation dynamics of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured under different conditions, revealing dynamical changes in proliferation potential. The results indicated that the proliferation potential was reduced in tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension cultures. FAMoS is a useful tool for data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces and can be applied to a wide range of biological problems due to its flexibility in handling various model structures. The algorithm addresses the limitations of existing model selection algorithms, which often rely on exhaustive searches of the total model space or compare a preselected number of models. FAMoS provides a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics and identifies relevant factors and processes that determine a system's behavior. Its ability to efficiently search large model spaces makes it a valuable contribution to various research questions in biology.
A 12-month follow-up study was conducted in Bolivia to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BNZ) treatment in school-age children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive children who received a 60-day treatment regimen of 5 mg/kg/day BNZ. Blood samples were collected at seven time points during and after treatment, and serology, conventional PCR (cPCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were performed to assess treatment efficacy. Additionally, plasma levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, including IL-17A, were measured. The results showed that 73 children completed the treatment, with 6 (11%) showing both cPCR and qPCR positivity, 24 (42%) showing cPCR negativity but qPCR positivity, and 27 (47%) showing both cPCR and qPCR negativity. IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and decreased to normal levels one year after treatment. Furthermore, IL-17A levels were positively correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR throughout the follow-up period. Notably, IL-17A levels in non-reactive subjects were significantly higher than in reactive or ambiguous subjects at the 12-month time point, suggesting that IL-17A may be a useful biomarker for detecting persistent infection and treatment response. These findings highlight the potential of IL-17A as a biomarker for evaluating treatment efficacy in Chagas disease.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis, contains a diminutive transposon called the Correia element ( CE ) that occupies almost 2% of its genome. Bioinformatic analysis revealed eight subtypes of the CE with four distinct types of ends. Transcriptional analysis using PCR and a lacZ reporter system showed that two ends in particular encode strong promoters. The activity of the strongest promoter is determined by a recurrent polymorphism at the right end of the element. The Correia elements can drive transcription of adjacent genes and may express small non-coding RNAs. Pair-wise comparisons between three meningococcal genomes revealed that no more than two-thirds of Correia elements maintain their subtype at any particular locus due to recombinational class switching between elements in a single strain. This process may represent a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for phase variation in the meningococcus. The strain-to-strain variability of the Correia elements and the large number of strong promoters encoded by them allows for potentially widespread effects within the population as a whole. The study defines the strength of the promoters encoded by the eight subtypes of Correia ends, providing a resource to predict the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus. The Correia elements may contribute to the development or persistence of hypervirulent lineages that are the source of most global meningococcal disease. Correia end subtype switching has the potential to act as a mechanism for phase variation, in which the transcription of genes under the influence of a CE is modulated by the recombination-mediated switching of Correia promoters.
The maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus produces a host-selective toxin, T-toxin, which promotes high virulence to maize carrying Texas male sterile cytoplasm (T-cms). ChLae1 and ChVel1, orthologs of the Aspergillus spp. regulatory proteins LaeA and VeA, were found to regulate T-toxin production, virulence, oxidative stress response, and development in C. heterostrophus. T-toxin production is significantly increased in the dark in wild-type (WT) strains, whereas Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutant toxin levels are much reduced in the dark compared to WT. Expression of T-toxin biosynthetic genes (Tox1) is up-regulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression is much reduced in Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutants. Overexpression of ChVEL1 and ChLAE1 increases T-toxin production and Tox1 gene expression in the dark and in light, respectively. ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, and super virulence, oxidative stress responses, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation. Deletion of ChLAE1 or ChVEL1 reduces tolerance to H2O2, and Chlae1 and Chvel1 mutants show decreased aerial hyphal growth, increased asexual sporulation, and female sterility. ChLAE1 overexpression strains are female sterile, while ChVEL1 overexpression strains are more fertile than WT. ChLae1 and ChVel1 repress expression of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthesis genes, and accordingly, melanization is enhanced in Chlae1 and Chvel1 mutants, and reduced in OE strains.
The mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels has been investigated using a combination of non-equilibrium simulation data and two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Analysis Methods for multiple ions traversing the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channel. The results indicate that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of NavAb in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. This block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions that can be ‘locked’ in place by modest applied forces. In contrast, three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions, with no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state. The non-equilibrium simulations predict that the useful work required to break the K+ block is equivalent to large applied potentials experimentally measured for two bacterial Nav channels to induce inward currents of K+ ions. These findings illustrate how inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in the simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from either crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes. The results are consistent with electrophysiological measurements of bacterial Nav channels and provide new insight into the mechanism of selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels.
This study investigated the intracellular spread of rabies virus in dogs with the furious and paralytic forms of the disease. The results show that the furious form of rabies has a more rapid viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres compared to the paralytic form, as measured by viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies and viral RNA levels. The study used image analysis to quantify the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes at different levels of the spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebrum in a cohort of naturally infected non-vaccinated dogs. The findings indicate that the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes decreases in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of antigen in neuronal cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, suggesting that replication occurs in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. Notably, greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious form compared to the paralytic form at all anatomic levels examined. This suggests that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. The results are consistent with previous studies showing greater inflammation in the paralytic form, which may be related to host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport.
The study investigated the genomic binding sites of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in Drosophila, with a focus on the Bithorax complex (BX-C). Chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis was used to identify CTCF binding sites in representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the BX-C, the Antennapedia complex, and the 3-Mb Adh region. The analysis revealed that CTCF binding sites map precisely to known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8 in the BX-C, suggesting a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for the functioning of these insulators. In addition, CTCF binding sites were found to correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing the identification of three additional presumptive insulator elements, "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4." These findings indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, with the possible exception of Fab-7. The study also compared the locations of CTCF sites with characterized Polycomb target sites and histone modification, providing support for the domain model of BX-C regulation. Overall, the results suggest that CTCF plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcription in Drosophila, and that its binding sites are essential for the functioning of insulators in the BX-C.
The study provides a detailed mechanism of an induced-fit process at atomic resolution in the enzyme-peptide deformylase (PDF) using a slow and tight-binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-PDF. Crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, as well as intermediate mimics, were solved to reconstruct the sequence of events from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is then "zipped up" by additional binding interactions. The study integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of the slow-binding mechanism. Actinonin, a slow and tight-binding inhibitor of PDF, exhibits unique inhibitory properties, including selective potency and long-lasting effects, making it a promising therapeutic candidate. The study highlights the importance of conformational changes in enzyme catalysis, where substrate binding is often coupled to conformational changes that alter the local environment of the active site to align reactive groups for efficient catalysis. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of slow and tight-binding inhibitors, which are favored for use as therapeutics due to their unique properties. The study also sheds light on the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions, where induced-fit mechanisms play a crucial role.
The study investigates the role of cortically-controlled population stochastic facilitation in guiding sensory transfer across the thalamic gateway. The thalamus serves as the primary relay station for sensory information to the cerebral cortex, with each cortical cell receiving input from multiple thalamic cells. However, the influence of cortical feedback on thalamic cells is often overlooked during sensory processing. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, the researchers implemented a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway combining biological cells and simulated circuits. The study found that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key factors: the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the convergence from thalamus to cortex, the statistics of corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, the results show that retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become desynchronized by cortical feedback. The study proposes that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of retinocortical signal transfer. A stochastic facilitation process emerging at the whole thalamic population level enhances global sensory information transfer in the presence of decorrelated corticogeniculate feedback bombardment. This process may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at the thalamic level.
The putative DNA demethylase NMAD-1 plays a critical role in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. NMAD-1 mutants exhibit reduced fertility, defects in prophase I of meiosis, and an increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation. RNA sequencing of the nmad-1 germline revealed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified NMAD-1 binding proteins, including topoisomerase TOP-2, which co-localizes with NMAD-1 on chromatin. The majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1, suggesting that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis. NMAD-1 binds to the same sites on chromatin in the germline as TOP-2 and physically interacts directly with TOP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. The nmad-1 deletion and catalytic mutant strains have impaired fertility, an increased incidence of males, elevated RAD-51 foci, and reduced replication rates, indicating that NMAD-1's demethylation activity at DNA is central to its role in meiosis. These findings suggest that NMAD-1 regulates DNA replication and repair during meiosis by interacting with TOP-2 and other proteins involved in these processes.
The study identifies adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) as a novel modulator of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. HCMV is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause significant morbidity in newborns and immunocompromised patients. Despite its large genome and complex glycoprotein complexes, the mechanism of HCMV infection remains poorly understood. The researchers found that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and that knockdown of APMAP expression significantly reduced HCMV infection in these cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of human APMAP in cells refractory to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, promoted HCMV infection. Biochemical studies suggest that APMAP interacts with gH/gL containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediates the nucleus translocation of tegument protein pp65. The results indicate that APMAP plays a role in the early stage of HCMV infection and functions as a modulator promoting HCMV infection in multiple cell types. The study provides new insights into the complex HCMV infection mechanism and identifies APMAP as an important player in this process. The findings suggest that APMAP could be a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against HCMV infection.
The article presents a minimal model of lineage commitment for hematopoietic progenitors that integrates both extrinsic and intrinsic cues. The model suggests that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. The model supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, indicating that cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors but can be strongly biased by cytokine signaling. The simulations show that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state depend on the starting progenitor state and the route of commitment chosen. The model also demonstrates good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis observed experimentally. The study highlights the importance of extrinsic regulation in instructing lineage choice and processing conflicting extracellular cues, showing that cell-fate decisions can be stochastic but are strongly biased by external cues. The model's topology was informed by experimental studies on lineage-specific receptors and transcription factors, and it provides insights into the molecular events that direct lineage commitment at the stem cell stage or at the multipotent progenitor level.
The ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototypic member of the Orthobunyavirus genus, has been elucidated using electron cryo-tomography. BUNV virions display a pleomorphic shape with a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes, each protruding 18 nm from the viral membrane. The glycoprotein spikes become disordered upon introduction to an acidic environment. A three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike was derived to 3-nm resolution using sub-tomogram averaging. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization. The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens. The glycoprotein sequences of BUNV are conserved with those of more pathogenic relatives, indicating a high degree of structural similarity between viruses. This study provides the first detailed 3-D structural analysis of an orthobunyavirus and a model for this large group of medically important viruses.
Title: ABCC5, a Gene That Influences the Anterior Chamber Depth, Is Associated with Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma

    A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on 5,308 individuals of Asian descent to identify genes associated with anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). The study found a significant association between a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs1401999) and ACD, with a per-allele effect size of -0.045 mm (P=8.17×10−9). This association was also observed in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PACG cases and 18,801 controls, with a per-allele odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06-1.22, P=0.00046). The association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles was included in the analysis (per-allele OR=1.30, P=7.45×10−9).

    The study suggests that genetic variants influencing ACD may contribute to the risk of PACG. The ABCC5 gene is expressed in anterior segment structures relevant to PACG, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens. Conditional analyses with previously implicated PACG loci showed no change in the association, indicating that the ABCC5 variant is a novel risk factor for PACG. The study provides further clues to the genetic mechanisms underlying PACG, a major cause of blindness in Asia.
The study identifies the first examples of developmental enhancers conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, two distinct clades of bilaterian animals. These enhancers, termed bilaterian conserved regulatory elements ( Bicores ), show sequence and gene synteny conservation between the two clades. Bicores are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and have been shown to drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The study suggests that Bicores are developmental enhancers that encode complex patterns of transcription factor binding sites. Bicore1, one of the identified enhancers, is predicted to function as a Bmp responsive element and drives expression in the developing central nervous system in vertebrates. The discovery of Bicores provides a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves. However, the small number of identified Bicores implies extensive cis-regulatory rewiring between the protostome and deuterostome clades. Further research is needed to determine the true extent of cis-regulatory sequence and function conservation underlying animal development. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis-regulatory logic improves, it is predicted that additional Bicores will be discovered.
Vaccination has a minimal impact on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses, according to a study that analyzed patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy. The researchers used next-generation sequencing to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. The study found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers, respectively. The study suggests that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. The findings are consistent across three H3N2 seasons and do not support the idea that vaccine-induced immunity serves as a potent selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level. The study contributes to a better understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape the genetic structure of viral populations within hosts and ultimately give rise to novel antigenic variants at the host population level.
The study investigated the efficacy of live attenuated Leishmania donovani (LdCen-/-) parasites in generating a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in young and aged mice. The results showed that LdCen-/- parasites induced a strong innate and adaptive immune response in both age groups, characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In young mice, LdCen-/- immunization led to a significant reduction in parasite burden in the spleen and liver after challenge with virulent L. donovani parasites. However, in aged mice, the adaptive immune response was reduced compared to young mice, resulting in less protection against the parasite. Despite this, LdCen-/- immunization still induced a significant but diminished host protective response in aged mice. The study found that the innate response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from both young and aged mice was enhanced after LdCen-/- infection, but the adaptive response in aged mice was lower than in young mice. The results suggest that LdCen-/- immunization can induce a protective immune response against VL in both young and aged mice, but the response is less effective in aged mice due to a reduced adaptive immune response. The study highlights the potential of LdCen-/- parasites as a vaccine candidate for VL, particularly in young individuals.
The study generated chimeras between enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) to investigate the role of capsid proteins in viral tropism, acid sensitivity, and optimal growth temperature. The chimeras were created by exchanging capsid proteins between EV-D68, a respiratory EV, and EV-D94, an enteric EV. The results showed that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity and restricted tropism of the respiratory EV, as well as its optimal growth temperature. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. The study found that EV-D94 with the capsid and 2A protease or the capsid only of EV-D68 were viable, and functional assays indicated that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues. Additionally, capsid genes were shown to participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, as EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. The study also demonstrated that EV-D68 maintains residual binding-capacity after acid-treatment despite a loss of infectivity. These findings provide new insights into the biophysical properties of EVs and may aid in the development of therapeutic targets for vaccine or antiviral treatment. The study highlights the importance of capsid proteins in determining the phenotypic diversity of EVs, one of the world's most prevalent pathogens.
The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI acts as a transmembrane Fc receptor on the surface of infected cells and virions, binding to human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). gE-gI can facilitate antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process where the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of IgG bind a viral antigen while the Fc region binds to gE-gI. The interaction between IgG Fc and gE-gI is pH-dependent, with binding occurring at basic pH but not acidic pH. This suggests that IgG bound to gE-gI at the cell surface would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. To investigate the fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI-bound IgG, an in vitro model system was developed using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor as intracellular trafficking markers. The results showed that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate the clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
The transcriptome profiles of the protoscoleces ( PSCs ) of Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agent of cystic hydatid disease ( CHD ), were investigated using Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis. The study aimed to elucidate the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins ( ESPs ) released by the parasite. A total of 26, 514 nonredundant sequences were generated, of which 22, 910 ( 86. 4% ) were mapped to the newly published E. granulosus genome and 17, 705 ( 66. 8% ) were distributed within the coding sequence ( CDS ) regions. The analysis predicted 2, 280 ESPs, of which 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 in protein metabolism. Eleven ESPs were identified as intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ( GL/GN ) pathways, while 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and four proteases were highly represented. Additionally, many proteins were found to be significantly enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. These findings provide valuable information on the metabolic adaptation of E. granulosus to its hosts, which can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of host-parasite interactions and adds supplementary knowledge regarding the genomics of E. granulosus.
In Aspergillus nidulans, the transcription factor NirA plays a crucial role in the regulation of nitrate assimilation genes. When nitrate is absent, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and inactive, whereas its presence leads to rapid nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that in the absence of nitrate, a conserved methionine ( Met169 ) in NirA's nuclear export sequence ( NES ) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide ( Metox169 ). This oxidation is dependent on FmoB, a flavin-containing monooxygenase, and is independent of thioredoxin and classical methionine sulfoxide reductases. Exposure to nitrate leads to the rapid reduction of NirA-Metox169 to Met169. Replacement of Met169 with isoleucine resulted in partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export, while replacement with alanine transformed the protein into a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis and subcellular localization studies suggested that Met169 oxidation leads to a change in NirA conformation. The results indicate that in the presence of nitrate, the activation domain of NirA is exposed, while the NES is masked by a central portion of the protein ( nitrate responsive domain, NiRD ), restricting active NirA molecules to the nucleus. In the absence of nitrate, Met169 oxidation leads to loss of protection by the NiRD, NES exposure, and relocation of the inactive NirA to the cytosol.
The article explores how functional constraints shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels. The primary function of these channels is to allow the propagation of action potentials. Mathematical models suggest that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for an action potential to propagate. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are highly similar in sequence. This similarity implies that their functional properties are also similar, consistent with the idea that these properties are tightly constrained. However, the multiplicity of genes encoding sodium channels raises the question of why there are so many. The article demonstrates that the simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity – the requirements of membrane excitability and the uniqueness of the resting potential – act directly on constraining sodium channel properties. The authors compare the predicted constraints with functional data on mammalian sodium channel properties collected from the literature, including 172 different sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under various conditions. The data from all channel types, including mutants, obeys the excitability constraint, while channels expressed in muscle tend to obey the constraint of a unique resting potential, whereas channels expressed in neuronal tissue do not. The excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups that are consistent with phylogenetic analysis. The calculations suggest interpretations for the functional differences between these groups.
Biomedical researchers have identified the influenza virus polymerase as a promising target for novel antiviral drugs due to its role in viral replication and transcription. The polymerase is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, and its unique cap-snatching mechanism can be inhibited by targeting either the PB2 cap-binding or PA endonuclease domains. The PA endonuclease domain, in particular, has been shown to be a viable target for antiviral drugs, as its inhibition can directly stall viral replication at an early stage. To develop more effective inhibitors, researchers have obtained high-resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin. These compounds chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme, highlighting the potential for structure-based optimization of inhibitors. The binding modes of the different compounds and a mononucleotide phosphate have been compared, revealing the plasticity of certain structural elements in the active site cavity and the importance of substituent groups in binding to distinct sub-pockets. These findings will inform the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase, ultimately contributing to the development of novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics.
The study aimed to develop an effective immunization protocol for producing potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers: Calloselasma rhodostoma, Cryptelytrops albolabris, and Daboia siamensis. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms using a "low dose, low volume multi-site" immunization protocol. The antisera showed a rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms and reached a plateau at around the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the three venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, which was higher than the minimal potency limits set by the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. The study demonstrated the successful production of potent, truly polyspecific antisera against the three vipers using the low dose, low volume multi-site immunization protocol. The commercial polyspecific antivenom in the form of F(ab')2 has been produced from the hyperimmune (HP) antisera by QSMI. This potent antivenom is expected to help save the lives of many victims of envenomation by the three and other related vipers in Southeast Asian countries.
The Salmonella effector protein SseI, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS), is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, and this inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), an important regulator of cell migration. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI (C178A) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. Infection with wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. Examination of spleens from mice infected with WT S. typhimurium revealed fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with ΔsseI S. typhimurium. These results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria. SseI's mechanism of action involves the interaction with IQGAP1, an important regulator of the cytoskeleton and cell migration.
The study investigated the role of the mobile genetic element SCCmec-encoded psm-mec RNA in regulating the virulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The researchers found that psm-mec RNA suppresses the translation of the agrA gene, which encodes a positive transcription factor for the production of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. PSMα is responsible for the high virulence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) compared to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). The study demonstrated that psm-mec RNA specifically binds to agrA mRNA and inhibits its translation, leading to reduced PSMα expression. In contrast, HA-MRSA strains with mutations in the psm-mec promoter or lacking the psm-mec gene exhibited increased PSMα expression and virulence. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec resulted in increased expression of AgrA and PSMα, and enhanced virulence in mice. The study suggests that the absence of psm-mec is a genetic determinant of the high virulence property of CA-MRSA, and that psm-mec RNA plays a crucial role in suppressing MRSA virulence. Furthermore, the study proposes that identifying psm-mec mutations could be a novel method for predicting the virulence properties of MRSA strains. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence of MRSA and highlight the importance of psm-mec RNA in regulating S. aureus virulence.
Scientists have investigated the phenomenon of antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in the context of dengue virus (DENV) infection, where maternal antibodies can increase the severity of disease in offspring upon primary infection with a heterologous or homologous DENV serotype. To replicate this phenomenon in a mouse model, researchers used type I interferon ( IFN ) receptor-deficient mice ( A129 ) born to DENV1-immune mothers and infected them with DENV2. The results showed that these mice exhibited enhanced disease severity, characterized by increased virus titers, extensive vascular leakage, and eventual death. However, to better mimic the natural human immune response, the researchers sought to reproduce this model in a less immunocompromised background. They found that 5-week-old A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers succumbed to a DENV2 infection within 4 days, which was sub-lethal in mice born to naïve mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy completely protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome. This A129 mouse model of ADE may help elucidate the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates. The model also has the potential to investigate the protective or enhancing properties of vaccination-induced maternal antibodies in infants and the possible interference of maternal antibodies on vaccination efficacy in babies and young children.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in humans in the Americas. The review included 51 studies and found that male sex was associated with VL in studies using the leishmanin skin test for diagnosis and in those where the clinical disease was the outcome. In contrast, male sex was not associated with VL when serological diagnosis was applied. Younger individuals were less frequently infected than adults but were more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were also associated with L. infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not associated with VL. Ecological studies showed consistent evidence that dog seropositivity is associated with human VL, emphasizing the relevance of dogs as a marker of the occurrence of VL among humans. The review highlights the need for studies to be conducted in new areas of the continent with improved methodological quality to investigate the patterns identified and their causes, as well as variables for which knowledge is poor. The findings of this review should be taken into account in developing more effective and well-targeted control measures for VL in the Americas.
Inhalation of Francisella tularensis ( Ft ) leads to acute and fatal pneumonia in mice, with the lung cytokine environment favoring exponential Ft replication. However, the mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death remain unclear. This study investigated the sequential and systemic host immune response in pulmonary tularemia and found that an overt innate cellular response to Ft, rather than overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and host mortality. Lethal infection with Ft elicits medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis, resulting in the recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ) to the lungs. These cells fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death that is partially dependent on immature Ly6G+ cells. In contrast, during sub-lethal infection with Ft, the pulmonary cellular response is characterized by a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, which are required for protection against Ft. The study reveals that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. Further, eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient but dramatic innate protection against Ft SchuS4. The findings suggest that differences in host mortality versus survival may be reflected not primarily by control of bacterial load, but by the nature of the innate myeloid cell response during the acute phase of infection.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a global invader and vector of medically important arboviruses such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. To understand the complex colonization pattern of this mosquito, researchers combined classical population genetics analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to reconstruct the demographic history of Aedes albopictus populations from representative countries in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. The results indicate that populations in Southeast Asia, including China, Thailand, and Japan, maintain high genetic connectivity, revealing their ancestral common origin. China appears to be the oldest population. In contrast, the invasion process in La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean Basin is primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, which maintains a relatively high genetic diversity within adventive populations. Independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae. albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in a great amount of intra-population variability. This variability may extend to the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, potentially contributing to the efficient transmission of arboviruses and outbreak establishment. The study provides valuable information on the origins of populations from various regions and highlights the importance of considering the interactions between genetic factors and environmental landscapes in assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen commonly associated with chronic wound infections, has been found to exhibit reduced virulence functions and biofilm formation capabilities in clinical isolates from human wounds. Contrary to previous assumptions, these findings suggest that bacterial fitness in chronic wounds is not mediated by virulence or biofilm functions. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. High-density bacterial growth conditions were found to be a key factor in mediating bacterial fitness in wounds, both in the presence and absence of a host. These results shed light on the bacterial functions necessary for chronic wound infections and the stresses that affect bacterial fitness in wounds. The study suggests that the predominant stresses on bacteria in wounds may be applied by the bacteria themselves, rather than the host, and that overlapping functions may counteract both bacterial and host-applied stresses. The findings also raise the possibility that chronic wounds may be relatively permissive environments where bacterial nutrient acquisition and growth do not depend on invasive or toxic functions. The study used a diabetic mouse model, which is relevant to human wound pathogenesis, and found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited wound-healing in the model, directly linking infection to disease. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic wound infections and suggest potential therapeutic targets to compromise wound infection pathogenesis.
A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research and Tertiary Referral for Bancroftian Filariasis (NEPAF) to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia, gross appearance/consistency of the testis, and the efficacy of complete excision of hydrocele sac in patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area. The study included 1,128 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele (Group-1) and a comparison group of 218 patients who had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Group-2). The results showed that the hydrocele recurrence rates in Group-1 and Group-2 were 0.3% and 19.3%, respectively (p<0.001). Per-surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively (p=0.081). The testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients from Group-1 and Group-2, respectively (p=0.025). The study suggests that lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid that threatens the integrity of the testis in an adult population living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas. The authors recommend complete excision of hydrocele sac and suture or excision of leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels to avoid hydrocele recurrence.
A deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) from the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis, TsUCH37, has been identified and characterized. TsUCH37 is a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein UCH-L5. The enzyme was identified using an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, which revealed DUB activity in lysate of T. spiralis L1 larvae. Immuno-precipitation and LC/MS/MS analysis identified peptides with sequence homology to five conserved human DUBs, including UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3. The predicted gene encoding TsUCH37 was cloned, and recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of TsUCH37 was verified using the Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation experiments showed that TsUCH37 associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 specifically inhibited recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. These findings suggest that the interaction of TsUCH37 with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution. The study highlights the potential use of inhibitor compounds to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and their investigation as therapeutic targets for trichinellosis.
The study investigated the anti-trypanosomal activity of non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors against the CL Brener strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Three nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors were found to exhibit anti-trypanosomal activity in the 0. 1 μM to 1 μM range, with two compounds showing EC50 values of 0. 12 μM and 0. 25 μM. These values were significantly lower than the corresponding Ki values measured against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain, suggesting a putative polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases. The study also evaluated cathepsin K inhibitors based on a cyclohexane dicarboxamide scaffold and found that two compounds exhibited significantly greater anti-trypanosomal activity than expected based on their cruzain inhibitory activity. The results suggest that the anti-trypanosomal effects of the most potent compounds may be due to inhibition of one or more cysteine proteases, including isoforms such as cruzipain-2, which have not yet been identified as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The study highlights the potential of non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors as antichagasic agents and suggests that phenotypic screening libraries for discovery of antichagasic agents should include potent inhibitors of cathepsin K.
Maize (Zea mays L.) is a crucial cereal crop and a model organism for studying genetics, evolution, and domestication. A sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map was constructed to cover 93.5% of the maize genome, with 86.1% aligned to the genetic map. This map contains 25,908 genic markers, enabling the alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The distribution pattern of expressed sequence tags correlates with recombination, and in collinear regions, 1 kb in rice corresponds to an average of 3.2 kb in maize. However, maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion, which can be attributed to its recent polyploid origin, resulting in most rice regions corresponding to two regions in maize. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during subsequent maize diploidization. Additionally, evidence of ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of maize and rice progenitors was found. The paleoethnobotany of the maize genome indicates that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes. Comparative restricted fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping across cereals showed that two maize chromosome sets aligned with one chromosome each of rice and sorghum, demonstrating a whole genome duplication event. The maize genome is thought to have emerged from tetraploidization of several ancient duplicated regions, with multiple duplication events contributing to its complex duplication pattern. Genome rearrangements have occurred since the divergence of maize and rice, as shown by synteny analysis.
The study aimed to investigate the de novo generation of infectious prions in vitro using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) procedure. Prions are proteinaceous infectious agents responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), and the prion hypothesis suggests that they are composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein (PrPSc) that replicates in the absence of nucleic acids by inducing the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). The study found that under standard PMCA conditions, de novo generation of PrPSc was not observed, supporting the use of the technology for diagnostic applications. However, modifications to the PMCA procedure allowed for the generation of PrPSc in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. The de novo generated PrPSc was found to be infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. These findings provide additional evidence in support of the prion hypothesis and suggest that prion diversity is not restricted to those currently known, and that new forms of infectious protein foldings may be produced, resulting in novel disease phenotypes. The study also highlights the potential of PMCA as a tool for studying the mechanism of sporadic prion disease.
A novel neurally based model, the Angular Velocity Detector Unit (AVDU), has been developed to estimate angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain. The model is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behavior. The AVDU is fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioral data. The model suggests that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings on the walls. The results show that the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behavior. Additionally, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer. The AVDU is proposed as an extension of the optomotor pathway, allowing different detectors to be constructed by drawing selectively from a pool of elementary motion detectors with varying response timescales and calculating the desired final response by combining the selected responses.
A long-term follow-up study of 50 human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients from the Ivory Coast has revealed that untreated infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the main agent of sleeping sickness, do not always result in a fatal outcome. Among 11 patients who refused treatment after initial diagnosis, 10 showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) over a 15-year period. Most of these patients (7/10) also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. Two alternative natural progressions of HAT were observed: progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection with negative results in parasitological tests and PCR. These findings suggest that trypanotolerance exists in humans, as is widely accepted for animals. The study's results are based on clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations combining field diagnostic tools and highly specific and sensitive laboratory tests. The study's findings have significant implications for future research in the field of HAT, particularly in understanding the natural evolution of T. b. gambiense infection in its human host.
This study investigated the role of p53 disruption in the carcinogenic effect of ionizing irradiation on hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo. The researchers used mouse models to determine whether irradiation selects for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors. They found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage, leading to the long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. The selection for p53-deficient cells is attributed to several factors, including protection from acute irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling/elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. These findings indicate that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing irradiation can be partly explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate elimination and long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation. The study suggests that the causal link between radiation exposure, p53 disruption, and cancers involves selection for p53 loss rather than irradiation-induced mutagenesis at loci encoding proliferation control genes.
The study investigated the role of Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 serine protease inhibitor in parasite development and its potential as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases. SmKI-1 was found to possess inhibitory activity against trypsin and neutrophil elastase (NE) through its Kunitz domain. Molecular docking studies revealed a complete blockage of NE's active site by SmKI-1's Kunitz domain. Recombinant SmKI-1 significantly inhibited NE's ability to kill schistosomes. Gene suppression of SmKI-1 in S. mansoni larvae resulted in impaired parasite development in vitro and in vivo. The study also demonstrated SmKI-1's anti-inflammatory potential in murine models of inflammatory diseases, including acetaminophen-mediated liver damage and gout arthritis. Treatment with SmKI-1 reduced neutrophil recruitment, elastase activity, and overall pathological score in these models. Additionally, SmKI-1 inhibited early events that trigger neutrophil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan. These findings suggest that SmKI-1 is a key protein in S. mansoni survival and has the potential to inhibit neutrophil function as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases. SmKI-1's ability to interact with elastase's catalytic site and inhibit enzyme activity may be an immune evasion mechanism developed by the parasite. The study highlights the potential of SmKI-1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
A novel method has been developed for accurately modeling large transmembrane helical (TMH) protein structures from distant homologues with distinct loop and TMH conformations. This method was tested in two blind predictions and a large benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity. The results show that the method improves most starting templates and achieves near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. The method was first-ranked in the GPCR-DOCK blind prediction contests for the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors. In the benchmark, the method was able to improve most starting templates to reach near-atomic accuracy prediction in the TMH regions. The technique was also tested in two challenging blind predictions of membrane receptor structures, GPCR-DOCK 2008 for the adenosine receptor (A2AR) and GPCR-DOCK 2010 for the chemokine receptor (CXCR4). The results suggest that the method is useful for rebuilding and refining X-ray structures of membrane receptors where functionally important loop regions have missing densities or are often deleted to facilitate crystallization. The method has the potential to be useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues. This is particularly important for the design of more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel function for systems/synthetic biology applications that rely on atomic-resolution information.
Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a persistent state in epithelial cells during prolonged infections. In human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells, L. monocytogenes ceases to produce the actin-nucleating protein ActA and becomes trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles called Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). Subpopulations of bacteria within these vacuoles resist degradation and enter a slow, non-replicative state. The bacteria can cycle between the vacuolar and actin-based motility stages, and when ActA is absent, they enter a "viable but non-culturable" state, making them undetectable by conventional colony counting methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin selects for vacuolar and "viable but non-culturable" bacteria. These findings suggest that L. monocytogenes can persist in a subset of epithelial cells, potentially leading to asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation periods of listeriosis, and increased survival during antibiotic therapy. The ability of L. monocytogenes to adopt a vacuolar lifestyle in epithelial cells may have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of listeriosis and developing effective treatment strategies. The study highlights the need to revisit the intracellular lifecycle of L. monocytogenes in light of its ability to live in vacuoles.
A neuromechanistic model of auditory bistability was developed to study the dynamics of alternations in auditory streaming after the build-up phase. The model incorporates sound-evoked A1 responses as input to a competition network, where perceptual states are identified in the neuronal dynamics rather than pre-assigned to phenomenological units. The inclusion of NMDA-like synaptic dynamics enables temporal binding from one triplet to the next to deal with gaps in the periodic sound input. The model predicts that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. This prediction was confirmed with psychoacoustic experiments, and the behavioral data was used to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The model provides a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition. The study focuses on accurately reproducing the dynamics of alternations after the build-up phase, distinguishing it from existing auditory models. Model parameters controlling the balance between adaptation and noise were tuned to match the statistics of perceptual durations, and A1 responses were interpreted in a statistical model using neurometric functions that mimic the time course of build-up. The model suggests that inputs should be dynamic and depend on perceptual state, rather than simply increasing stimulus strength to favor the attended percept.
A novel method for assessing the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins has been developed using a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukaemia (RBL) reporter cell line (RS-ATL8) in combination with a cell-free in vitro translation system. This system enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins within 90 minutes, allowing for the assessment of potential allergenicity without the need for purification. The method involves incubating the translated proteins with serum from infected individuals and measuring Luciferase activity in the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line, which indicates cellular activation by the suspected allergen. The suitability of this system was demonstrated using well-characterised plant and parasitic allergens, including Par j 2, SmTAL-1, and IPSE/alpha-1. SmTAL-1 was found to activate the basophil reporter cell line, while SmTAL2, used as a negative control, did not. This method offers an accessible way to assess the potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera. The technology has the potential to unravel the entire allergome of S. mansoni and other medically important parasites, leading to a better understanding of the basis of allergenicity and the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection mechanisms at the molecular level.
This study investigates the effects of transposable element (TE) divergence on gene and TE expression in a hybrid dysgenic syndrome of Drosophila virilis. Hybrid dysgenesis occurs when TEs inherited from the father are not matched with a pool of corresponding TE silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provided by the female germline, leading to germline damage and sterility. The study characterizes the effects of TE profile divergence between parents on offspring using the D. virilis syndrome as a model. The results show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression between genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, which are transmitted to the next generation. Furthermore, chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. The study also demonstrates that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents, which arise through polymorphic TE insertions. These findings support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. Overall, the results suggest that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
The study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. Researchers found that overexpression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3, 6, or 11 suppressed CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This suppression resulted from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat-containing transgene. The study also showed that histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repressed FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extended lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. The results suggest that the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis, leading to increased expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. Furthermore, the study found increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS-derived cell lines. This epigenetic change correlates with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. The findings provide a disease model for FXTAS and suggest that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus. The study's results also indicate that alterations in chromatin structure at the FMR1 locus are dynamic and modifiable, and that various genetic and pharmacologic manipulations of histone acetylation can change the level of transcription in human cells and animal models.
The study investigated the role of host genetics in controlling CD8 T cell function and lethal immunopathology during chronic viral infection. MHC alleles and the degree of MHC heterogeneity were found to be associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function and viral control during human chronic infection. To examine the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection, an F1 cross of B10. D2 x B6 ( D2B6F1 ) and BALB. B x BALB/c ( BCF1 ) mice were infected with the clone-13 ( Cl-13 ) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ). The results showed that both H-2bxd D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. However, H-2bxd D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD8 T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice, indicating that mortality was CD8 T-cell-dependent. The study found that D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. Furthermore, D2B6F1 mice induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was also dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production. The results suggest that increased functionality of the CD8 T cell response allowed for more rapid viral clearance at the cost of enhanced immunopathology dependent on both MHC diversity and the genetic background of the host.
This study investigated the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. A total of 106 strains were analyzed using canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. The results showed that five sublineages/subgroups of B. anthracis were detected, including A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009. These sublineages were found in various provinces, including Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. However, the geographical distribution of the B. anthracis populations exhibited different canSNP characteristics from those of the strains isolated before 1990 in China. The A. Br. Ames subgroup was also observed to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces. MLVA15 genotypes were assigned to all 106 strains, and 21 of these types were first observed in this study. The strains collected from anthrax outbreaks in the recent decade were classified as subgroups A. Br. 001/002 and A. Br. Ames and identified as genotypes MLVA15-28, MLVA15-30, MLVA15-31, MLVA15-38, MLVA15-CHN3, and MLVA15-CHN18. The study found that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is gradually becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help promote the prevention and control of this important disease.
Goblet cells in the intestinal epithelium play a crucial role in defending against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and related pathogens that cause severe diarrheal disease. During infection, goblet cells produce various mediators, including Resistin-like Molecule (RELM)-β, which is strongly induced in response to Citrobacter rodentium, a related mouse pathogen. RELM-β acts as a CD4+ T cell chemoattractant, recruiting these immune cells to the infected colon, where they drive a protective increase in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation through the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). Mice lacking the RELM-β gene (Retnlb-/-) suffer increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts and impaired IEC hyper-proliferation. Enema delivery of RELM-β to Retnlb-/- mice restores CD4+ T cell recruitment, increases IL-22 levels, and promotes IEC proliferation, reducing mucosal pathology. These findings demonstrate that RELM-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against enteric pathogens, in part via the induction of increased IEC proliferation. This study expands the role attributed to goblet cells in providing host defense against enteric bacteria and highlights the importance of RELM-β in recruiting immune cells to the site of infection.
The interaction between the C-terminal motif of norovirus VPg and the HEAT-1 domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is essential for translation initiation in noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Norovirus RNA lacks a 5´ m7G cap and internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and instead relies on the VPg protein covalently attached to the 5´-end of the viral RNA to interact with eIFs in the host cell. Using pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the study demonstrates that a 20-amino acid stretch at the C-terminus of murine norovirus (MNV) VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. This interaction is conserved in all known noroviruses. Fine mutagenic mapping suggests that the MNV VPg C-terminus may interact with eIF4G in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the VPg binding site on eIF4G HEAT-1, which was confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. The study also shows that this site is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G HEAT-1. The functional significance of the VPg-eIF4G interaction was demonstrated by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation. These findings define important structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G and reveal a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy.
The evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes has been a topic of interest in the scientific community, with several explanations proposed to account for their formation. The selfish operon model suggests that clustered arrangements of genes are more easily transferred to other species, improving the prospects for survival of the cluster. In contrast, the persistence model proposes that genes in close proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. To investigate the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve, the authors developed computational models to study the selfish operon model, a Moran process with natural selection for gene clustering and genome inversion events, and a model that includes selection and inversion. The results show that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, but can occur under certain conditions such as a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and a high horizontal transfer rate in the case of the selfish operon model. The selfish operon model remains a viable explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under these conditions. However, the model is unable to explain the observation that genes in clusters are sometimes arranged in the order of biochemical reactions, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be involved. The persistence model, which proposes that clustered genes are less likely to be disrupted by deletions, is an alternative explanation for the clustering of essential genes.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, poses significant health and economic burdens in tropical regions. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, a parasite-encoded, hyper-variable antigen, called VAR2CSA. VAR2CSA binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas. The gene encoding VAR2CSA is only expressed in the presence of a placenta, suggesting that its expression is actively repressed in men, children, or non-pregnant women. A small upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the var2csa gene acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. This translational repression is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue. Further studies into the mechanisms used by malaria parasites to regulate VAR2CSA expression will provide insights into the molecular basis of the host-parasite interactions underlying the pathogenesis of the disease. The conservation of the var2csa gene in most Plasmodium falciparum isolates and its presence in the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi suggest a selective pressure acting on preservation of this gene.
A genome-wide microarray analysis was conducted on whole blood RNA from 34 dengue virus (DENV)-infected children in Nicaragua to investigate the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. The study aimed to elucidate the pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection. Gene expression analysis identified differentially regulated genes between clinical subgroups, with striking transcriptional differences observed between dengue patients with and without shock, particularly in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis of the dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Notably, the interferon response observed in vitro was not consistently observed in in vivo patient samples, suggesting a transient interferon response by days 3-6 of illness. The study highlights important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection and identifies commonalities. A meta-analysis of larger datasets across multiple studies may lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach. The study also identified a distinct molecular profile between Nicaraguan dengue patients with shock and those with dengue hemorrhagic fever, as well as between severe and non-severe dengue cases. A total of 32 genes were significantly different between severe and non-severe dengue cases, with 25 genes more highly expressed in severe patients and 7 genes more highly expressed in non-severe patients.
The study investigated the host entry mechanisms of Murid Herpesvirus-4 ( MuHV-4 ), a lymphotropic rhadinovirus related to Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. MuHV-4 was found to target the olfactory neuroepithelium for host entry in vivo. The virus exploits the presence of heparan sulfate ( HS ) on the apical neuronal cilia of the olfactory neuroepithelium for binding and entry. In contrast, the respiratory epithelium, which also expresses HS, was bound poorly by incoming virions. The olfactory neuroepithelium is composed of neurons, sustentacular cells, and basal precursor cells, and MuHV-4 was found to infect both neurons and sustentacular cells. The infection ratio of sustentacular cells to neurons was approximately 3.6:1. The study suggests that the olfactory neuroepithelium provides an important site for herpesvirus entry, and that HS binding is a key component of this process. The findings imply that neuroepithelial-targeted, HS-based interventions could provide a general means of herpesvirus infection control. The study also highlights the specificity of MuHV-4 infection to the olfactory neuroepithelium, as virions lacking HS binding proteins poorly infect transformed epithelial cells and lungs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the host entry mechanisms of MuHV-4 and the role of the olfactory neuroepithelium in herpesvirus infection.
The study reveals a novel regulatory circuit involving CRP-cAMP in the silencing of Salmonella virulence genes under non-permissive conditions. CRP-cAMP, a widely established metabolic regulator, modulates the expression of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level. This regulation occurs through a newly identified regulatory motif within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the hilD gene. The study shows that CRP-cAMP-deficient Salmonella strains exhibit a strong upregulation of SPI-1 genes in the mid-logarithmic growth phase and are unable to secrete SPI-1 T3SS effector proteins, indicating a role for CRP-cAMP in the regulation of Salmonella virulence. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate that the Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP and, when this repression is relieved, exerts a positive effect on hilD expression. Spot 42 targets the 3'UTR of the hilD transcript through its unstructured region III. The study highlights the biological relevance of the hilD 3'UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression. The CRP-cAMP-mediated regulation of hilD does not occur at the transcriptional initiation level but rather at the post-transcriptional level through the long 3'UTR of hilD. The study suggests that CRP-cAMP is a regulator tailored to mediate rapid responses to environmental changes and may be relevant for HilD-mediated regulation of virulence in response to environmental conditions encountered during the infection process.
The study investigated the relationship between CAG/CTG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the Huntington’s disease (HD) locus in R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. CAG/CTG expansions are responsible for HD and myotonic dystrophy 1, and their instability in somatic tissues accelerates disease progression. The study found that CAG instability rates were higher in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with increased CAG instability in R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, while H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1 matched-tissues. Notably, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. These findings suggest that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo and that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability. The study also indicates that the integration site of the transgene influences repeat instability, affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity.
Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is a highly virulent enterovirus that can cause severe neurological complications in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to disseminate in humans are not well understood. To investigate this, researchers analyzed the genomic features of EV71 in an immunocompromised host with disseminated disease, comparing five full-length genomes sequenced from different sites of infection. Three nucleotide changes were identified within a five-day period : a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 ( L97R ), a conservative substitution in protein 2B ( A38V ), and a silent mutation in protein 3D ( L175 ). Infectious clones containing these mutations were constructed and tested in vitro, revealing that the VP1 L97R substitution conferred a replicative advantage in neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was frequently associated with a second non-conservative mutation ( E167G or E167A ) in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells. Comparative models of the EV71 VP1 variants suggested that the substitutions may alter interactions with host cell receptors. The study found that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism, independent of EV71 lineage, and may have contributed to dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying EV71 infection and may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies.
Pheromone Recognition and Selectivity by ComR Proteins among Streptococcus Species
    The ComRS system is a quorum sensing mechanism that regulates natural transformation, or competence, in the Gram-positive bacteria genus Streptococcus. This process allows bacteria to acquire new traits, such as antibiotic resistance, through the uptake of extracellular DNA. The ComRS system consists of a peptide (ComS) that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds and activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR then engages in a positive feedback loop to express ComS and the alternative sigma-factor SigX. Although ComRS is present in most Streptococcus species, the sequences of ComS/XIP and ComR diverge significantly, suggesting a mechanism for species-specific communication.

    To study cross-talk between Streptococcal species and the molecular interaction between ComR and XIP, an interdisciplinary approach was undertaken. A 'test-bed' assay was developed to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo. The results revealed distinct ComR classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. An X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis was solved to understand the interaction with XIP and identify structural features that may explain XIP recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to probe the apo conformation of the XIP-binding pocket, which is lined by a variable and conserved face. The conserved face contributes to ligand binding, while the variable face discriminates among XIP peptides. These findings provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity, allowing for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity.
In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, centromeres are epigenetically inherited and maintained at specific chromosomal sites over generations. Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where centromeres are defined by a specific DNA sequence, Candida albicans centromeres are maintained by epigenetic mechanisms where DNA has a less definitive role. Genome-wide replication timing analysis revealed that each centromere in Candida albicans is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. The formation of new ectopic centromeres ( neocentromeres ) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, with the neocentromere becoming the first to replicate and associating with origin recognition complex ( ORC ) components. Changes in the level of centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to concomitant changes in ORC association with centromere regions, supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This pattern is conserved among related strains and species, independent of primary DNA sequence, suggesting that inheritance of centromere position is correlated with a constitutively active origin of replication that fires at a distinct early time. The study proposes a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 158,025 individuals of European ancestry identified three genetic loci associated with chronic back pain (CBP). The study, conducted by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank, used logistic regression models to adjust for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p = 7.2×10−10), which was subsequently replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample (OR 1.06, p = 5.3×10−11) and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p = 4.5×10−19). Two other loci, an intergenic variant rs7833174 located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p = 4.4×10−13) and an intronic variant rs4384683 in DCC (OR 0.97, p = 2.4×10−10), reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis. The study aimed to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying CBP and identified novel associations between specific genetic markers and the condition. The results suggest that genetic factors contribute to the development of CBP, and further research is needed to understand the underlying biology.
A study was conducted to estimate the disease burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis in Cameroon. The disease is a zoonosis that affects both humans and pigs in many developing countries, with human neurocysticercosis being a major cause of epilepsy in endemic regions. The study aimed to calculate the impact of this neglected zoonosis using cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DALY ) estimations. Data on human and porcine cysticercosis in West Cameroon were collected and analyzed using R software. The estimated number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy was 50, 326 ( 95% CR 37, 299–65, 924 ), representing 1. 0% of the local population. The number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15, 961 ( 95% CR 12, 320–20, 044 ), which corresponds to 5. 6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon were estimated at 10, 255, 202 Euro ( 95% CR 6, 889, 048–14, 754, 044 ), with 4. 7% attributed to losses in pig husbandry and 95. 3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The average number of DALYs lost was 9. 0 per thousand persons per year ( 95% CR 2. 8–20. 4 ). This study provides an estimation of the costs due to T. solium cysticercosis using country-specific parameters and including both the human and animal burden of the zoonotic disease.
In Staphylococcus aureus, a non-coding RNA called RsaA has been identified to play a crucial role in regulating bacterial persistence and virulence. RsaA is a Sigma B-dependent RNA that represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. This repression leads to enhanced production of biofilm and decreased synthesis of capsule formation, resulting in a decreased protection against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Mice animal models showed that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection. RsaA is part of a regulatory network that contributes to the complex interactions of S. aureus with the host immune system, moderating invasiveness and favoring chronic infections. RsaA is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. The study suggests that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host. The deletion of rsaA increases the invasiveness of the bacteria in mice sepsis models and resistance to opsonophagocytic killing, while RsaA promotes biofilm formation and catheter colonization in mice, potentially promoting harmful colonization and chronic infections in humans. RsaA functionally links the global regulators σB and mgrA, with potential consequences on the temporal expression of virulence determinants.
A novel strategy has been developed to visualize HIV-1 uncoating in vitro and in living cells using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of cyclophilin A (CypA-DsRed). CypA-DsRed is specifically packaged into virions through high-avidity binding to the HIV-1 capsid (CA). Single virus imaging reveals that CypA-DsRed remains associated with cores after viral membrane removal and is lost concomitantly with CA in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and is accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. The majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late times post-infection reveals a gradual loss of CypA-DsRed dependent on reverse transcription. Uncoating occurs both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. This novel imaging assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells, revealing spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process. The CypA-DsRed probe efficiently and specifically incorporates into HIV-1 particles without compromising viral infectivity, allowing for the visualization of CA on mature native HIV-1 cores without additional manipulations. The correlation between CypA-DsRed retention time and capsid stability supports the notion that CypA-DsRed loss reflects HIV-1 uncoating.
The study investigated the usage of oligonucleotides in prokaryotic genomes and their relationship to various properties such as codon usage, DNA base-stacking energy, and DNA structural conformation. The researchers analyzed the frequencies of oligonucleotides ranging from di- to octanucleotides in coding and non-coding regions of 402 prokaryotic chromosomes. The results showed that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, indicating that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short-range correlated, meaning that information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions on average. The study also found pronounced DNA compositional differences within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes, with GC-rich genomes being more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria. The study suggests that oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides possess little additional information potential in prokaryotic DNA.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the factors influencing meiotic recombination, a process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity. While significant progress has been made in understanding the initiation of recombination at human hotspots, little is known about factors acting downstream. To address this, a study simultaneously analyzed both crossover and noncrossover recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots. The analysis revealed a novel form of biased transmission, exclusive to noncrossover recombinants, which arises from differences in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. This form of biased gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity but constitutes a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive. The study found that this drive favors strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs, consistent with established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes. The findings suggest that this form of biased gene conversion may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome and contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination, potentially influencing the evolution of genomic base composition.
Biomedical researchers have developed a computational systems biology model to predict the effects of environmental chemicals and drugs on human health. The model integrates toxicogenomics data, chemical structures, protein-protein interaction data, disease information, and functional annotation to associate chemicals with diseases and identify potential molecular targets. This approach differs from existing computational chemical biology networks, which primarily focus on integrating drug information. The researchers used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ), which contains curated information on drug and environmental chemical associations with proteins. They selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 unique compounds and 6,060 molecular targets known to be involved in human disease. By analyzing these associations, the researchers identified new chemical-disease associations and potential molecular targets for chemicals such as di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine. The model can also predict which chemicals may be risk factors for human health, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis. However, it is essential to note that the model does not distinguish between positive and negative associations between chemicals and diseases. The study highlights the importance of integrating toxicogenomics data with other data types to better understand the molecular mechanisms of environmental chemicals and their effects on human health.
The study presents a novel approach to characterizing auditory cortical neurons by fitting nonlinear feedforward network models to their responses to natural sounds. The network receptive field (NRF) model reveals that primary auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to a substantially larger spectrotemporal domain than their standard spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). The NRF model consists of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly and consistently outperforms STRFs in predicting neural responses to auditory stimuli. The NRF model also uncovers separate excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with distinct nonlinear properties, including gain control and conjunctive feature detection. These conjunctive effects enable increased selectivity for complex spectrotemporal structures, which may play a crucial role in sound recognition. The NRF model is a parsimonious network that remains easy to interpret in a physiological context. The study demonstrates that fitting feedforward network models to single neuron activity in primary cortical areas (A1/AAF) allows for better predictions of their responses to natural sounds and reveals some of the nonlinear signal processing strategies used by the auditory brain. The NRF model expands on simple linear receptive field models, yielding substantially improved predictive power and providing insights into the underlying richness and nonlinearity of cortical processing.
The circadian clock in mammals is regulated by a complex transcription-translation feedback loop that drives the rhythmic expression of the transcriptome and allows the organism to anticipate daily events. A novel clock-perturbing peptide was used to investigate the role of casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) -mediated circadian BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation ( BMAL1-P ) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. The study revealed a pivotal role for CK2 in BMAL1-P and a novel function of cryptochrome ( CRY ) as a repressor of CK2 protein kinase activity toward BMAL1-S90. CRY-mediated periodic binding of CK2β to BMAL1 inhibits BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation by CK2α. The FAD binding domain of CRY1, two C-terminal BMAL1 domains, and BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1 are critical for CRY-mediated BMAL1–CK2β binding. Reciprocally, BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation is necessary for BMAL1-Lys537 acetylation. A dual negative-feedback model was proposed in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1–P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. This loop forms a distinct interlocked loop in the clock machinery and has integral roles in the core circadian oscillator through periodic CRY-mediated negative feedback suppression. The study established a circadian clock-controlling role of CK2 kinase in BMAL1 phosphorylation and uncovered a novel role of CRY as a regulator of cyclic CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the CK2-mediated posttranslational loop and its role in regulating the intracellular circadian core oscillator.
The bacterium Salmonella enterica has developed mechanisms to survive in the presence of bile, a substance that disrupts membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) allows Salmonella to adapt to lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. The general stress response plays a crucial role in adaptation to bile, as RpoS mutants are sensitive to bile. Furthermore, individual Salmonella cells can become bile-resistant without adaptation, with frequencies ranging from 10−6 to 10−7 per cell and generation. Fluctuation analysis indicates that these resistant cells were present in the previous culture, and full genome sequencing of resistant mutants reveals that alteration of the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery is a common cause of mutational bile resistance. However, selection on lethal concentrations of bile also yields resistant isolates that are not mutants, suggesting that these cells may have been in a physiological state that allowed them to survive upon encountering bile. Single-cell analysis of gene expression using a microscope fluidic system shows that batch cultures of Salmonella contain cells that activate stress response genes in the absence of DOC, highlighting the existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations of bacteria. This phenomenon may illustrate the adaptive value of gene expression fluctuations.
The E. coli chromosome is organized into 400-500 supercoiled domains through both active and passive mechanisms, including transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is found to be organized as a stable chromosomal domain, bounded by the proximal location of its termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the Mu genome. The formation and maintenance of this domain are dependent on a strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, the Mu L end, the MuB protein, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis, and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations tested. In contrast, prophage λ does not form an independent domain. The establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain are promoted by low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent. This domain configuration is thought to confer transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may also contribute to its long-term stability. The Mu domain is characterized by a closed-loop structure, where synapsis of prophage ends is assisted by processive supercoiling by gyrase bound to a centrally located SGS site. This structure is thought to aid the transposition of Mu during its lytic phase of growth, and is also present in the quiescent prophage state.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial drug that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocytes, thereby reducing post-treatment transmission. A randomized treatment-to-reinfection cohort study in Papua New Guinean children investigated the effects of PQ on Pv and Pf gametocyte carriage after radical cure. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, Artemether-Lumefantrine, and either PQ or placebo. Blood samples were collected at 2- to 4-weekly intervals over 8 months to detect gametocytes using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR targeting pvs25 and pfs25. PQ treatment reduced Pv gametocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. The majority of Pv and Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that mixed-species infections reduced the odds of gametocytes for both species. PQ treatment had no effect on Pv gametocyte density or proportion of Pv infections carrying gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment were equally likely to carry gametocytes as first infections after PQ treatment. Pv relapses and new infections had similar gametocytaemia levels, highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for Pv control. The study suggests that PQ treatment should be used for all Pv infections to prevent relapses and reduce gametocyte carriage.
The Rho family of GTPases plays a crucial role in controlling actin organization during various cellular processes, including migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The primary members of this family, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, exhibit distinct downstream effects on actin remodeling despite sharing a common mechanism of targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. A computational analysis was conducted to investigate the details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol, which is hypothesized to be key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. A modeling framework was developed to analyze experimental data for these systems, allowing for the revelation of details of GDI-mediated cycling and the distinction between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. The analysis of Rac membrane cycling revealed that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase were presented in multidimensional charts, which can be used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane-bound GTPase. This methodology was applied to analyze glucose-stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells and can be used as a guide in assessing how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios. The results demonstrate that Rho-GTPase cycling can access qualitatively diverse pathways in different cellular systems or through different experimental manipulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to control and eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem. To achieve this goal, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programmes are used to collect data on the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Traditionally, data are collected from school-aged children (SAC) due to their high likelihood of infection and ease of sampling. However, adults are also likely to be infected, and their infection burden can significantly impact the effectiveness of treatment strategies. This study investigates the importance of collecting adult data to inform treatment strategies for S. mansoni. The authors use three different age-intensity profiles of infection with low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults to examine how the age distribution of infection affects mathematical model-generated recommendations for preventive chemotherapy coverage levels. The results show that for moderate prevalence regions, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals, but for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. The study highlights the need for M&E programmes to collect prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, including adults, to accurately determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region. The authors also emphasize the importance of collecting additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, to inform treatment strategies.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by seizures that can be resistant to medication, prompting resective surgery as a treatment option. However, the success rate of this procedure is unpredictable, with many patients continuing to experience seizures post-surgery. To address this issue, a computational model of epilepsy was applied to patient-specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. The model was validated by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. The results showed that patients tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more frequently than controls, and regions in the left hemisphere, particularly within temporal and subcortical regions, are the most common starting points for seizures in patients. The model also implicated regions in the contralateral and frontal locations in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Furthermore, the model predicted that patient-specific surgery, where resection areas are chosen based on individual model-prompted results, may lead to better outcomes than the standard clinical procedure. This study provides a first step towards developing a patient-specific computational model of epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies. The model's predictions are based on a bistable model and DTI data, and the results suggest that subject-specific surgery may result in greater seizure reduction than standard resection procedures.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) employs various strategies to evade the host's innate antiviral defenses, including the use of viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) to block interferon and apoptotic signaling. The vIRFs function in a dominant negative manner to inhibit cellular IRF activities and target proteins involved in apoptosis, such as p53 and TGFβ receptor-activated Smad transcription factors. This study identifies vIRF-1 as a direct target of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim, which is a key negative regulator of HHV-8 replication. vIRF-1 mediates the inactivation of Bim through nuclear translocation, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay and western analysis of fractionated cell extracts. Co-localization of vIRF-1 and Bim was observed in the nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. In vitro co-precipitation assays revealed a direct interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim, and deletion and point mutagenesis mapped the Bim-binding residues of vIRF-1. Generation of Bim-refractory vIRF-1 variants confirmed the importance of the vIRF-1:Bim interaction in pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activity. Blocking the interaction with a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the Bim-binding region of vIRF-1 also confirmed the relevance of vIRF-1:Bim association to vIRF-1 pro-replication activity. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which HHV-8 controls replication-induced apoptosis and suggests that inhibitory targeting of vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide an effective antiviral strategy.
The study investigated the role of the epithelial integrin αVβ6 in regulating the amplitude of protective lung interferon responses against multiple respiratory pathogens. Mice lacking the β6 integrin (β6 KO) were found to be protected from disease caused by influenza infection, characterized by reduced acute lung injury (ALI), edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability of the lung epithelium. β6 KO mice also exhibited altered baseline homeostasis, with high baseline CD11b+ CD11c+ macrophages. The resistance of β6 KO mice to influenza infection was dependent on the loss of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and elevated type I interferon (IFN) signaling. However, the phenotypic changes in lung macrophages were independent of the type I IFN pathway. Macrophages isolated from TGF-β1-treated β6 KO mice displayed decreased mRNA encoding levels of IFN-associated transcripts, suggesting that the loss of β6-activated TGF-β results in an altered lung macrophage population and increased type I IFN activation. Administration of exogenous TGF-β1 to β6 KO mice led to reduced numbers of CD11b+ macrophages, decreased type I IFN signaling activity, and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. The study demonstrates that the loss of one epithelial protein, αVβ6 integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infection, leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival against multiple respiratory pathogens, including influenza, Sendai virus, and bacterial pneumonia.
Title: Reappraisal of Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) in the management of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: A retrospective analysis from a reference center in Argentina

    A retrospective analysis of 733 cases of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) was conducted at a reference center in Argentina from 2006-2015 to assess the usefulness of the Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic support tool. The study found that LST was a useful complement to diagnosis, with a high correlation with smear results, particularly for lesions older than 21 days. The analysis included 678 localized cutaneous cases, 50 mucosal cases, and 5 disseminated cases. Diagnostic confirmation was reached in 474 cases through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases having negative LST results among this group. Among smear-negative cases, 190 were also negative by LST, but 69 instances had positive LST results. The study found similar ratios of sensitivity between smear and LST across age groups. The results support the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for ACL across all age groups, even in endemic areas. Standardization of the LST technique and further research into its most adequate preparation and utilization protocols are recommended to aid in the management of suspicious clinical cases. The study highlights the need for expansion of control programs and generation of research-based evidence in all aspects of leishmaniasis, particularly for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, the most frequent cause of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 loci associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the causal mechanisms underlying most of these loci remain unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the role of epigenomic changes in human macrophages in the development of CAD. The researchers used a combination of open chromatin mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which leads to foam cell formation. The results showed that oxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites, which correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. The researchers identified several transcription factors, including C/EBP-beta, which has no previously documented role in foam cell formation, and found that oxLDL exposure up-regulated C/EBP-beta expression and increased its genomic binding events. Variants at CAD-associated loci were significantly enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure, including rs72664324 in an oxLDL-induced enhancer at the PPAP2B locus. The protective A allele of rs72664324 increased C/EBP-beta binding and enhancer activity, leading to increased expression of the PPAP2B protein product LPP3, which degrades pro-inflammatory mediators. The study provides a genetic mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PPAP2B locus and highlights the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli.
The World Health Organization (WHO) previously recommended that districts with trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) prevalence in 1–9-year-olds of 5.0–9.9% receive three rounds of azithromycin mass treatment. However, this recommendation may not be practical due to the large number of endemic districts worldwide and the resources required to conduct surveys. In Malawi, eight districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5.0–9.9% received one round of azithromycin mass treatment, achieving a mean coverage of approximately 80%. Population-based trachoma surveys were conducted in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts at least six months after the treatment. The results showed that each of the 18 evaluation units had a TF1-9 prevalence of less than 5.0%. This study demonstrates that one round of azithromycin mass treatment with approximately 80% coverage is associated with a reduction in TF prevalence to less than 5.0% in Malawi districts with TF prevalence of 5.0–9.9%. The study suggests that this approach may be sufficient to eliminate active trachoma in Malawi districts that are hypoendemic at baseline. The findings provide optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020. The study's results are consistent with a previous cohort study in Tanzania, which found that one round of very high coverage azithromycin completely interrupted local transmission of ocular C. trachomatis.
Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein complexes play a crucial role in sensing infections and triggering immune responses in plants and humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the activation of NLR resistance (R) proteins by pathogen effectors initiates convergent immune responses, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. Recent studies have identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) that mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors, WRKY8/28/48, to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. Additionally, CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production. These findings delineate the bifurcation of complex signaling mechanisms downstream of NLR immune sensors mediated by the myriad action of CPKs with distinct substrate specificity and subcellular dynamics. The results provide genetic evidence that Ca2+ signaling via specific CPKs plays pivotal roles in the diverse downstream signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by distinct intracellular NLR immune sensors.
Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic disease prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, poses a significant public health burden due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. The disease is exacerbated by factors such as irrigation and hydro-electric projects, shifts from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, and ineffective control programs. Despite its impact, less than 0.5% of Schistosoma investigations have attempted to predict its spatial and temporal distributions. To address this knowledge gap, a longitudinal retrospective study was conducted in the district of Niono, Mali, from 1996 to 2004. The study employed general-purpose exponential smoothing methods within a state-space framework to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts of Schistosoma haematobium time-series. The results showed that the exponential smoothing state-space framework produced reasonably accurate forecasts, with mean absolute percentage error values of approximately 25% for 1- to 5-month horizon forecasts. This approach effectively captured prior non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates, such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions. The study suggests that this framework can assist in managing and assessing Schistosoma haematobium transmission and intervention impact in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially elsewhere in the Sahel region. The findings highlight the potential of parsimonious forecasting and early warning systems to enhance public health programs in developing countries.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has evolved a self-imposed restriction mechanism mediated by the viral tegument protein pp150, which prevents the onset of viral gene expression in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle by binding to cyclin A. This restriction ensures that viral replication occurs in the G0/G1 phase, where cyclin A expression is low or absent. However, in S/G2 cells, pp150-mediated repression is relieved once cells lose cyclin A protein after cell division. To investigate the physiological relevance of this restriction, a cyclin A-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus was employed. The results showed that unrestricted viral gene expression in S/G2 led to a G2/M arrest, but G2-arrested cells still supported viral replication. The viral gene product pUL21a was found to destabilize cyclin A, maintaining the virus-permissive G2-arrest. A double-point mutant virus, where both pp150 and pUL21a were disabled in cyclin A interaction, forced mitotic entry of the majority of infected cells, resulting in a severe negative impact on cell viability and virus growth. These findings suggest that pp150 and pUL21a functionally cooperate to build a cell cycle synchronization strategy of cyclin A targeting and avoidance, which is essential for productive HCMV infection. The results indicate that the pp150-dependent restriction to cyclin A-negative cells is a genuine function in the productive replication cycle of HCMV, rather than an inevitable by-product of a silencing mechanism.
Title: Targeted Exon Capture and Sequencing in Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration, resulting in paralysis and death. Approximately 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, with the remaining 10% being familial. While genetic studies in familial ALS have identified causative mutations, the cause of ALS in approximately 30% of familial cases and the majority of sporadic cases remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, researchers undertook a targeted sequencing approach of 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. The study aimed to identify novel variants linked to ALS.

    The results showed a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating the identification of disease-associated mutations. A candidate gene approach was used to discover new mutations in biologically relevant ALS genes, and functional studies were employed to assess the relevance of newly identified variants. Bioinformatics tools were used to evaluate variant pathogenicity, and a rare variant binning approach demonstrated a higher burden of deleterious mutations in cases compared to controls. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of sporadic ALS. The findings suggest that novel or rare mutations in a set of key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS, underscoring the need for rigorous approaches to distinguish true disease-causing variants from benign ones.
This study investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus. The results show that IL-6 is crucial for the recall of influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells. IL-6 was found to suppress the activity of virus-specific CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. The study used wild-type and IL-6 deficient mice to compare influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory responses after infection with influenza virus. The results indicate that IL-6 is a selective regulator of long-term CD4+ T-cell memory responses, limiting the activity of virus-specific Tregs. In IL-6 deficient mice, virus-specific Tregs were more readily detectable and were able to suppress the activity of virus-specific memory T cells. This suggests that IL-6 plays a critical role in ensuring that antigen-specific Tregs do not down-modulate the immune response during an acute infection with a cytopathic virus, thereby favoring pathogen clearance and survival of the host. The study also found that the memory CD8+ T cell response was unimpaired in IL-6 deficient mice, implying that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differ in their susceptibility to suppression by Tregs. Overall, the findings highlight a novel role for IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus.
A new nuclear function of the glycolytic enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica has been identified. Enolase, which catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, was found to interact with the cytosine-5 methyltransferase 2 ( Dnmt2 ) protein. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screen, and further studies revealed that enolase acts as an inhibitor of Dnmt2 activity. The inhibitory activity of enolase was found to be antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls the non-glycolytic function of enolase. In response to glucose starvation, enolase accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with the E. histolytica Dnmt2 homolog ( Ehmeth ), leading to a reduction in tRNAAsp methylation in the parasite. The role of enolase as a Dnmt2 inhibitor was confirmed in E. histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal-fused enolase. This study establishes enolase as the first Dnmt2-interacting protein and highlights an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity. The results also suggest that glucose metabolism and Dnmt2 activity are linked, and that the interaction between enolase and Dnmt2 may be conserved across different species, including Drosophila and humans.
For the first time, researchers have identified exogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are vectors of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are typically found inside cells. However, circulating miRNAs have been detected in human serum and saliva. The study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, of which 31 were previously unknown and designated as novel. Some of these miRNAs were only expressed in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. The researchers tested five saliva miRNAs for their potential to regulate CHIKV infection and found that inhibiting these miRNAs decreased viral replication. This suggests that the presence and upregulation of these miRNAs in mosquito saliva may enhance CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host. The study provides strong evidence for the presence of mature insect miRNAs in mosquito saliva and highlights the potential role of these miRNAs in the transmission and establishment of CHIKV infection. This is the first report on the identification of exogenous mosquito saliva microRNAs, and the findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission.
This study investigated the role of nuclear double-strand break repair (DSBR) proteins Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p in the repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mitochondrial DNA encodes essential proteins for cellular respiration, and deletions in the mitochondrial genome are associated with various diseases and disorders. The study used a mitochondrially-targeted restriction endonuclease to induce a double-strand break (DSB) in the mitochondrial genome, allowing for direct analysis of DSB repair in vivo. The results showed that loss of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous deletion events and impaired the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs. Rad51p and Rad59p were found to localize to the matrix of the mitochondria and bind directly to mitochondrial DNA. The study also demonstrated that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p impact the rate of spontaneous mitochondrial DNA deletions and the repair of induced mitochondrial DSBs in yeast. This is the first study to demonstrate the role of these proteins in the repair of specific mtDNA lesions. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial mutagenesis and repair, particularly DSBR, and highlight the importance of these proteins in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.
This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between social determinants of health and the risk of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The review included 90 studies that measured the relationship between crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, or socioeconomic status and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. The majority of studies (57.1%) reported a significant association between socioeconomic determinants and the risk of GAS infection, while 50% reported a significant association with ARF/RHD. Crowding was the most frequently assessed factor, with 14 studies examining its association with GAS infection and 36 studies examining its association with ARF/RHD. The majority of studies assessing crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, and employment status of parents or cases, and nutrition reported a positive association with the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. The Bradford Hill criteria for evidence of causation were met for crowding and socioeconomic status. However, the literature examining the role of social determinants in GAS infection, ARF, and RHD risk lacks quality, with most studies being observational rather than interventional. The findings suggest that crowding is a practical target for prevention actions to reduce the risk of GAS infection and ARF/RHD.
A single point mutation in the PhoQ protein of the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network results in a phosphatase-deficient mutant that exhibits a bistable response to stimulus, as opposed to the wild-type's graded response. The mutant cells can exist in two distinct states, with different morphologies, and their state is inherited over many generations. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that the bistability depends on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoQ. The mutant's bistable phenotype comes at a substantial fitness cost, with the on state having a lower fitness than the off state in stationary phase cultures in rich medium. However, due to the high inheritance of the on state, a population of on cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlights the tradeoffs in the particular case of the PhoQ/PhoP system. The findings suggest that the architectural features of the network that allow the mutant to exhibit bistability are shared among many two-component systems. The mutation, which produces a T281R substitution in PhoQ, results in bistability with mutants persisting in morphologically distinct OFF and ON states for many generations.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Current treatment options are limited, and the high mortality rate makes PAM a significant public health concern. To address this issue, researchers have turned to drug repurposing, a cost-effective strategy to apply known drugs for the treatment of rare or neglected diseases. N. fowleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes, similar to fungi. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens. The N. fowleri genome encodes the sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) target, which shares 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologues, raising the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs for PAM treatment. This study systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs on N. fowleri sterol biosynthesis and viability, identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate, and analyzed the interactions between the recombinant CYP51 target and conazoles. The results validated CYP51 as a potentially druggable target in N. fowleri and conazole drugs as candidates for assessment in the animal model of PAM. The findings suggest that CYP51 inhibitors, such as fluconazole and miconazole, may be effective against N. fowleri and warrant further investigation as potential treatments for PAM.
Interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) plays a crucial role in triggering a host protective type 2 immune response against nematode parasites. However, its function in maintaining type 2 immune responses after polarization is not well understood. To investigate this, researchers used a mouse model where IL-4Rα gene deletion can be temporally controlled. The study found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is necessary for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following primary infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Additionally, the study showed that IL-4Rα mediated signaling is required for the recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites during secondary infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4Rα prior to secondary infection resulted in a diminished recall of Th2 responses and reduced ability to clear the infection. These findings suggest that IL-4Rα has a novel function in maintaining anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, distinct from its role in immune polarization. The study highlights the importance of sustained IL-4Rα mediated signaling in the maintenance of protective immunity against nematode parasites. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of type 2 immune responses and have implications for the development of vaccines against parasitic nematodes.
A global analysis of the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals reveals that humans play a significant role in shaping the patterns of disease risk for themselves, their commensal animals, and wildlife. The study analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes to date, including 67 new genotypes, and found that the pathogenic genus likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key proximate hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The study also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. The findings suggest that humans, domestic animals, and wildlife should be kept separate to protect the health of all. Bartonella is a rich system for examining the impacts of humans on patterns of infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes, and across the globe. The study's phylogenetic inferences about the origin of infections should be interpreted with caution, as they are heavily influenced by available data and the taxa that have been sampled. The results highlight the importance of considering a broad range of potential animal hosts and screening for a wide range of Bartonella genotypes when investigating the source of a suspected Bartonella infection. Mammalian species associated with humans, such as dogs, cats, cows, and rats, have managed to bring their strains of Bartonella globally, with rats being particularly common in the largest clade of globally distributed rodent Bartonella.
The study investigated the role of long noncoding RNA MALAT1 in regulating cell cycle progression. MALAT1 levels were found to be upregulated in cancer tissues and associated with hyper-proliferation. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in normal human diploid fibroblasts revealed that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 led to activation of p53 and its target genes, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells were sensitive to p53 levels. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells displayed reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. These findings suggest that MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. The study proposes that abnormal expression of MALAT1 in specific cell types or tissues results in aberrant alternative splicing leading to misexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and/or cell death, thereby contributing to tumor progression. Overall, the study provides mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While its action in repressing larval metamorphosis is well understood, the molecular basis of its role in promoting adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. Recent studies have shown that the JH receptor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met), mediates JH action during metamorphosis and vitellogenesis. However, the precise mechanism underlying JH's role in vitellogenesis has been lacking. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular basis of JH's action in promoting vitellogenesis in the migratory locust. Using RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy a JH-deprived condition, the authors demonstrated that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis. The study identified Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes involved in the DNA replication pathway, as key targets of JH action. Depletion of Mcm4 or Mcm7 inhibited de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, resulting in reduced vitellogenin mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Furthermore, the study showed that the JH-receptor complex directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences. These findings suggest that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in the migratory locust.
The “Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Leprosy” (TENLEP) trial aimed to determine the optimal duration of prednisolone treatment for patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI) in leprosy. A total of 868 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 20-week or 32-week course of prednisolone, with the primary outcome being the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at 78 weeks. The results showed that the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the two groups, with 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm. Additionally, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes, except for a higher proportion of serious adverse events in the 32-week treatment arm. The study found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. The results suggest that a 20-week course of prednisolone is the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which only a minority of patients may require further individualized treatment. This study provides evidence to support the use of a shorter duration of prednisolone treatment for patients with recent NFI in leprosy.
The study presents a computational model of the larynx and vocal tract of male Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) and European Red Deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) to investigate the relationship between sound complexity and anatomy/physiology. The model, based on the morphology and biomechanics of the elk, can produce a wide range of fundamental frequencies. The results show that low fundamental frequencies require low vocal fold strain, but high lung pressure and large glottal flow to achieve sound intensity levels above 70 dB at 10 m distance. In contrast, high-frequency bugles require large muscular effort to strain the vocal ligament and high lung pressure to overcome phonation threshold pressure. However, high-frequency bugles can achieve at least 10 dB more intensity level than low-frequency calls. The study found that glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound power to aerodynamic power at the glottis, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage of high-pitched signaling. This advantage is attributed to lower airflow requirements for aerodynamic power and an acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies. The study suggests that the high-frequency bugle may signal muscular strength and endurance, while the low-frequency call relates to overall body size. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of vocal communication in mammals.
Title: Discovering Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Multi-Read Analysis of ChIP-Seq Data

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become a widely used technique for mapping transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. However, the standard approach of using only uniquely mapping reads (uni-reads) can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. To address this limitation, a new method for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads) has been developed. This approach allocates multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme.

Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, the authors demonstrate that incorporating multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, detects novel peaks not identifiable with uni-reads, and improves peak detection in mappable regions. Computational experiments reveal that peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to those identified by uni-reads, except that the majority reside in segmental duplications. Independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis validates a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks and identifies novel target genes of GATA1. These results establish the importance of multi-reads for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments. The incorporation of multi-reads can increase sequencing depths by up to 25% and lead to the identification of novel binding sites in highly repetitive and low mappability regions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set targets for 2020 to control or eliminate four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs): human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. A study estimated the economic benefits to individuals of achieving these targets through innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). The study used a systematic literature review to identify information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs, which were combined with projections of the number of people affected by each disease. The study compared an ideal scenario where the 2020 targets are met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation in 1990 remained unchanged. The economic benefits were calculated as the difference between the two scenarios, discounted at 3% per annum from 2010. The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be $23.1 billion in 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion in 2021-2030. The reduction in OPPs was estimated to be $14 billion and $18 billion for the same periods. The study found that the economic benefits of achieving the targets far exceed the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners. The benefits are particularly significant for disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries, who often bear the brunt of the health and economic consequences of NTDs.
The prevailing theory in neuroscience suggests that neurons with higher selectivity, which respond to a narrower range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a recent study in the auditory cortex challenges this notion. The study found that the amount of information encoded by the neural population is not dependent on the selectivity of individual neurons, but rather on the total number of population spikes in a given time window. In the auditory cortex, neuronal responses are less selective immediately after sound onset and become highly selective in the sustained response epoch. Contrary to the prevailing theory, the study found that the neural population conveys similar information about sound input across both epochs, despite the differences in neuronal selectivity. The results suggest that inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property. This finding implies a novel principle of sensory encoding that may be shared among multiple sensory systems. The study's results raise questions about the nature of dynamic stimulus encoding in sensory systems and challenge the conventional approach of interpreting informativeness based on neuronal response selectivity. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of sensory information processing in the brain.
During chronic viral infections, the immune system must maintain anti-viral T cell responses over an extended period to control viral replication and prevent disease progression. While inhibitory signals, such as PD-1, have been well-characterized, the role of stimulatory signals in sustaining anti-viral T cells is less understood. This study investigated the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 (CD134) in the context of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 infection. The results show that OX40 is critically required for the maintenance of anti-viral T cell responses during chronic LCMV infection. Anti-viral T cells express high levels of OX40 in the presence of their cognate antigen, and mice lacking the OX40 receptor fail to accumulate sufficient anti-viral T cells, leading to impaired germinal center responses and antibody production. Consequently, OX40-deficient mice are unable to control LCMV clone 13 infection over time. The study highlights the importance of OX40 signaling in sustaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections. Furthermore, the findings suggest that OX40 plays a key role in driving both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, as well as T cell-dependent antibody responses, during persistent LCMV infection. Overall, the study establishes OX40 as a critical factor in maintaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence, with implications for the study of T cell dysfunction in persistent viral infections in humans.
Convergent Evolution of Mechanically Optimal Locomotion in Aquatic Invertebrates and Vertebrates
    A study reveals that a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. The optimal specific wavelength ( OSW ), defined as the length of an undulation along an animal’s fin during swimming divided by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length, is consistently around twenty. This value maximizes the force generated by the body, which in turn maximizes swimming speed. The OSW is a pattern of movement that occurs across a morphologically diverse set of moving appendages on aquatic animals, including invertebrates such as cuttlefish and vertebrates such as cartilaginous and bony fish. The study suggests that the regulation of OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation in the phyla in which these traits are observed may reflect the action of common genetic networks. This phenomenon unifies a vast diversity of swimming organisms and raises questions about why slower forms of swimming exhibited by median/paired fin animals would emerge and thrive despite the prevalence of body/caudal fin swimming in ancestral species. The study also highlights the convergent evolution of anatomical specializations for one type of body/caudal fin swimmer that minimizes trunk movement during tail fin movement, resulting in a similarly pure thrust element.
The study investigated the roles of condensins I and II in neural stem cell (NSC) divisions during cerebral cortex development in mice. Condensins are evolutionarily conserved protein complexes essential for chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes. The research found that both condensins I and II are crucial for NSC divisions and survival, with simultaneous depletion of both leading to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, DNA damage, and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condensins I and II resulted in slower loss of NSCs compared to simultaneous depletion, but displayed distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation was observed more prominently in NSCs depleted of condensin II, whereas mitotic delays were detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II displayed hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects were also observed in postmitotic neurons. The study demonstrates that condensins I and II have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, providing evolutionary insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes. The findings suggest that condensins I and II are essential for early embryonic development and cortical development in mice, with almost equal contributions to NSC division and subsequent cell survival.
The transcriptome of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni was investigated in a stage- and sex-comparative manner to study the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in this species. RNA-seq analysis was performed on males and females at five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages, and adults. A total of 7,168 genes were found to be differentially expressed between sexes in at least one developmental stage, with 4,065 of them being functionally annotated. The study also analyzed H3K27me3 histone modification using ChIP-Seq before (in cercariae) and after (in adults) the appearance of phenotypic sexual dimorphism. The results suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of known players of the host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and different dynamics of the H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as an illustration of sex-biased epigenetic landscapes. The findings provide new insights into the reproductive function of S. mansoni and represent a promising source of therapeutic targets for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease caused by this parasite.
The article presents a novel approach for modeling disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. The proposed method assigns a confidence value to each annotation, representing the posterior probability that it is correct. This is achieved by estimating annotator-specific parameters from data and computing certainty levels for individual annotations. Two probabilistic models are developed and compared using computer simulations and actual performance testing on a large dataset generated by human annotators. The results show that even in the worst-case scenario, where all annotators disagree, the approach significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation. A corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts and a 1,000-sentence subset annotated by five new experts is made publicly available. The study aims to provide a holistic approach to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of several annotators, allowing for the retention of the complete dataset as a basis for training and testing machine learning methods. The models for annotation reliability are validated through a second cycle of annotation, where five additional annotators annotate a subset of the original 10,000 sentences. The study highlights the importance of careful experimental design and appropriate modeling in improving existing curation approaches. It is suggested that small-scale annotation experiments can be conducted to estimate error rates specific to the task and annotator experts, which can be used to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert with a known correctness rate.
A DNA vaccine platform using geese has been developed to produce antiviral biologics against Andes virus ( ANDV ), the primary cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome ( HPS ) in South America. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins, resulting in the production of high-titer neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies, known as IgY and IgYΔFc, were purified from egg yolks and shown to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. The protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibodies was tested in a hamster model of lethal HPS. Hamsters were challenged with a lethal dose of ANDV and then passively transferred with α-ANDV immune sera or IgY/IgYΔFc purified from eggs. The results showed that both immune sera and egg-derived purified IgY/IgYΔFc protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively, from lethal HPS. In contrast, hamsters receiving IgY/IgYΔFc purified from normal geese or no treatment developed lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate the potential of the DNA vaccine/goose platform to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure. The use of this platform offers an alternative to human convalescent sera or mammalian antibodies, which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans.
The Dnmt3a enzyme plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining normal DNA methylation patterns in the genome. Research has shown that mutations in Dnmt3a are associated with leukemias, and its deletion in a mouse model of lung cancer promotes tumor progression. To investigate the role of Dnmt3a in cancer, scientists used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to characterize the methylomes of Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. The results revealed that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors exhibit large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains, whereas Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further analysis showed that Dnmt3a is essential for maintaining DNA methylation patterns in active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors exhibit moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. These findings suggest that Dnmt3a acts as a tumor suppressor gene by protecting active chromosome domains against cancer-associated hypomethylation. The study provides new insights into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer and highlights the importance of Dnmt3a in preventing tumor development. The results also reveal conserved features of cancer methylomes and provide a better understanding of the epigenetic alterations underlying tumor-promoting effects of Dnmt3a mutations.
The study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying sequence generation in the songbird premotor cortical microcircuit. Using multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging, the researchers found that neural activity in the premotor cortex is correlated with a length scale of 100 µm. Within this length scale, basal-ganglia–projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm. This rhythm is coherent over a length scale matching that of projection neuron calcium activity. The activity patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered, with two cell types, HVCX projection neurons and HVC interneurons, firing in alternating phases of the local 30 Hz rhythm. Inhibitory neurons show patterned activity throughout song, while projection neurons fire sparsely, with calcium events correlated in time between neighbors. This suggests a microcircuit in which multiple pools of excitatory neurons drive local interneuron populations. The study suggests that spatial clustering and 30 Hz rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells may be a recurring feature of cortical motor microcircuits and critical for the sequential organization of behavior. The findings have implications for future biophysical models of motor sequence generation in the songbird premotor cortex, which should consider the interplay of spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition.
The regulation of lifespan is a complex process influenced by both genetic and environmental factors in many species. Recent studies have identified specific components from various cellular processes that control lifespan. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss-of-function mutations in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1/daf-2 signaling pathway have been shown to significantly extend lifespan. However, the role of genes essential for growth and development in longevity has not been previously assessed. A screen of 2,700 genes essential for C. elegans development identified 64 genes that extend lifespan when inactivated post-developmentally. These candidate lifespan regulators are highly conserved from yeast to humans and can be classified into functional groups, including insulin and metabolic pathways, translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many of these essential gene inactivations extend lifespan as much as the strongest known regulators of aging. Early gene inactivation of these essential genes causes growth arrest at larval stages, and some of these arrested animals live longer than wild-type adults. The daf-16 gene is required for the enhanced survival of arrested larvae, suggesting that the increased longevity is a physiological response to the essential gene inactivation. These findings suggest that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in the regulation of aging at any stage in life.
A forward genetic screen in zebrafish identified a temperature-sensitive allele of the ECM component laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) that impairs fin regeneration. Positional cloning and complementation assays revealed that lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This event facilitates the expression of morphogenetic factors shha and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1r, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. In contrast, lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. Fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression, linking a central growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. The findings suggest that transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key, growth factor-guided step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis. The regeneration epidermis expresses markers of developmental signaling pathways, including Fgfs, Igfs, Wnts, Hhs, Activin-βA/TGFβ, Retinoic acid, Bmps, and Notch. However, the mechanisms by which these pathways define the morphology and signaling activities of the regeneration epidermis have not been addressed.
The article compares the performance of several linear mixed model (LMM) approaches and software implementations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with family-based data. The LMM methods, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, were applied to a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals. The results show strong concordance between the different LMM approaches, and all are successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The LMM results are also highly correlated with alternative approaches, such as MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. The study concludes that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches and are a convenient and robust method for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits. The choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power or type I error considerations. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of LMM approaches in controlling the overall genomic inflation factor to an appropriate level and offers higher power than traditional family-based association analysis approaches. The results are based on both real and simulated data derived from a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazilian families.
The development of new drugs against Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a priority due to the toxicity and limited efficacy of existing treatments. A high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was optimized to identify compounds that inhibit T. cruzi infection of mammalian cells. A 2000-compound chemical library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, were identified as hits with high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. These compounds exhibited distinct mechanisms of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, with CX1 showing trypanocidal activity, NT1 having a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affecting parasite division. The compounds also demonstrated high activity against T. cruzi from the Y strain and related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Further characterization of chemically related molecules led to the selection of two compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values of 2 nM, approximately 100 times lower than existing treatments. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
A novel point-of-collection diagnostic platform, termed "Backpack PCR," has been developed for the rapid detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitoes. This platform combines a rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology with a portable, battery-powered PCR platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. The system eliminates the need for expensive and bulky instrumentation, making it suitable for use in minimal resource settings. The performance of the platform was evaluated by comparing it to standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques and real-time PCR. The results showed that the NaOH-based extraction method and test strip-based detection assay provided sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from extracted mosquito pools. Additionally, the miniaturized PCR approach was compared to laboratory-based thermal cycling, demonstrating the potential for point-of-collection-based use of the entire diagnostic platform. The Backpack PCR system has the potential to increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within Brugia malayi-endemic locations and provides a proof-of-concept framework for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite responsible for approximately 90% of the global lymphatic filariasis burden. This platform could also be extended to the detection of other mosquito-borne pathogens, such as malaria, Zika, dengue fever, and Chikungunya.
The self-assembly of elastomeric proteins into polymeric structures is a complex process that has evolved independently multiple times in nature. These proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements, with the former providing elasticity and driving the assembly process, and the latter stabilizing the polymer. The arrangement and number of these domains significantly impact the assembly and mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. To investigate the effects of domain architecture on polymer assembly and integrity, a novel simulation environment was developed using a diffusion-limited aggregation model to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating domain architectures. The model was applied to various domain architectures, and the resulting aggregates were analyzed using graph-theoretic metrics to predict their structural integrity. The results showed that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains can significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure. Specifically, the most highly connected polymers were those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. These findings provide insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and may be useful for designing new biomaterials with tunable properties. The study demonstrates the potential of computational modeling in understanding the complex relationships between elastomeric domains and cross-linking domains, and in guiding the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
The study investigated the role of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) genome in regulating viral polymerase translation and replication. The results showed that the EBOV 5′-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes) but instead regulate cap-dependent translation. The 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA was found to strongly suppress translation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablating each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (pORF). The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation and was surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence, which suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. The presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. A recombinant EBOV was generated with the L uAUG mutated to UCG, resulting in a 10-100-fold decrease in virus growth in Vero and A549 cells, as well as decreased viral RNA synthesis and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression and replication, and suggest that the L uAUG is a potential therapeutic target.
Genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in human chromosomes has revealed non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots scattered along chromosomes. These hot spots delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains, termed forum domains. Approximately 30% of these domains possess coordinately expressed genes, suggesting a novel type of gene regulation. PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the forum domain termini, which may influence coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters within these domains. The binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at these sites may play a crucial role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. The study highlights the relationship between human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer genomics and gene therapy. The technique used to map DSBs can also be applied to study fragile chromosomal sites in various human cell types. The findings suggest that the binding of HNRNPA2B1 at forum termini may influence coordinated transcription within these domains, and the interaction between PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 may be a key mechanism in the functioning of chromosomal domains. This study provides new insights into the regulation of gene expression and chromosomal organization, and highlights the potential importance of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 in these processes.
A study was conducted in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to investigate the presence of trypanosomatids in bats from two areas with different levels of degradation: Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica (EFMA). A total of 181 bat specimens were analyzed, and 24 individuals (13%) were found to be infected with trypanosomatids. The most frequently detected parasite was Trypanosoma dionisii, followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV, and Trypanosoma sp. in Neotropical phyllostomid bats. Mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. Notably, the study also identified Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas for the first time. The results suggest that bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment. The study highlights the importance of including parasites that can potentially infect humans in studies of local biodiversity, particularly in areas with high human population density.
This study investigated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in the French Ardennes. A total of 267 female ticks were analyzed using high-throughput real-time PCR, rRT-PCR, and nested PCR. The results showed that 45% of the ticks were co-infected with up to five different pathogens, and when including symbionts, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. The study found a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, but no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens. The high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks raise questions about possible co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals and their consequences to human and animal health. The study also demonstrated high prevalence rates of symbionts co-existing with pathogens, opening new avenues of enquiry regarding their effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological situation of tick-borne pathogens circulating in ticks from the French Ardennes, highlighting the importance of considering co-infections in the study of tick-borne diseases.
The hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision is governed by a genetic switch involving the master genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels, allowing for rapid deployment of transcription factors to implement specific genetic programs. A computational model of the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision reveals that dynamical models based on known interactions between PU.1 and GATA-1, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to produce bistability, a necessary feature for robust lineage determination. To achieve bistability, a new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated and recruited by one of the master genes is proposed. This cofactor binds to the antagonistic partner, enabling bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppression of the cofactor leads to a loss of cooperativity and a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, resulting in irreversible commitment. The genetic switch demonstrates both primed and committed states by regulating cooperativity through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing the feedback between master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. This approach provides a framework for lineage commitment studies and may aid in identifying lineage-determining genes.
The enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) plays a crucial role in the virulence of Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen with high resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. A complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes, including oatA, pgdA, dltA, and sigV, synergistically inhibit lysozyme's enzymatic and cationic antimicrobial peptide activities. To identify novel genes modulating E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme, random transposon mutagenesis was performed in a quadruple oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV mutant. This led to the identification of several independent insertions in a locus referred to as the EPA variable region, located downstream of the conserved epaA-epaR genes. The EPA variable region was previously proposed to be responsible for EPA decorations, but its role remained largely unknown. This study shows that EPA decoration contributes to resistance towards charged antimicrobials and underpins virulence in the zebrafish model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. The production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections, and the modification of this surface polymer is essential for enterococcal pathogenesis. The results indicate that several genes contributing to EPA decoration play an essential role in resistance to effectors of the innate immune system and in virulence.
The study presents RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation), a novel framework for integrating genome-wide data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) to predict gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). RACER infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are then used to infer TF/miRNA-gene interactions. This two-stage regression framework circumvents the difficulty of integrating ENCODE data measured in generic cell lines with sample-specific TCGA measurements. The model was validated through 10-fold cross-validation and demonstrated superior statistical power in detecting known miRNA/TF targets compared to existing methods. A feature selection procedure identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered consistently with cytogenetic risk groups, including miR-548p, which was implicated in AML pathogenesis. Survival analysis using the inferred activities identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker. RACER successfully integrated TCGA and ENCODE data to reveal an AML-specific regulatory program at a global level. The study demonstrates the potential of RACER to uncover novel regulatory relationships and identify potential biomarkers for AML. The model's ability to integrate multiple data types and infer sample-specific regulatory activities makes it a valuable tool for understanding the complex regulation of gene expression in cancer.
This study investigated the role of RNA silencing in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum. Knock-out mutants were generated to affect genes for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR ), two Dicer-like ( DCL ), and two Argonaute ( AGO ) proteins. The results showed that Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2 double mutant, and Δago1 strains exhibited severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains. The greatest effects on both RNA populations were observed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains, in which a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 ( ChNRV1 ), was derepressed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 showed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA. C. higginsianum parental and Δdcl1 mutant strains cured of ChNRV1 revealed that the conidiation and spore morphology defects were primarily caused by ChNRV1. The study proposes that RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum functions as an antiviral mechanism. The results suggest that DCL1 and AGO1 are critical for maintaining low levels of accumulation of ChNRV1, a novel dsRNA virus in C. higginsianum.
This study investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF in meiotic expansion of H2AX phosphorylation and spermatogenesis in mice. Three waves of H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) have been observed in male meiotic prophase I: the first is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptonema, while the second and third are ATR-dependent, occurring at zygonema and pachynema, respectively. The third wave of H2AX phosphorylation marks and silences unsynapsed chromosomes. The study found that MOF is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion. Germ cell-specific deletion of Mof in spermatocytes by Stra8-Cre (Mof cKO) caused global loss of H4K16ac. In leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes of cKO mice, the γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In almost 40% of early-mid pachytene spermatocytes from Mof cKO mice, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, which consequently caused meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure. Furthermore, defects in double-strand break (DSB) repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof cKO spermatocytes, indicating that MOF facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment. The study proposes that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from the leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively.
The study investigated the effects of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human T-cell development in a “Human Immune System” (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model. The mice were infected with HTLV-1 at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes were detectable. The results showed that the HTLV-1 provirus was integrated in thymocytes in all but two inoculated mice, and the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In HTLV-1-infected mice, alterations in human T-cell development were observed, with mature single-positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ cells being most numerous at the expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25, which was correlated with the presence of tax mRNA and increased expression of NF-kB-dependent genes such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene. The study also found that HTLV-1 infection led to the expansion of mature T-cells in the periphery and the development of pathological features such as hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoma/thymoma. The results demonstrate the potential of the HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- animal model to elucidate the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1. The study suggests that Tax activates the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mice and favors the expansion of mature activated T cells.
An integrated control project for schistosomiasis was implemented in Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 to 2011. The project aimed to reduce the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly Schistosoma haematobium infection. The study population consisted of 482,902 individuals, with 78,615 primary school students being the major target group for intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections. Urine and stool specimens were examined using the urine sedimentation method and the Kato cellophane thick smear method, respectively. At baseline, the overall prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced to 13.5% (95% CI = 0.331-0.462). The reduction in prevalence was higher among girls, those with moderately infected status, and residents in rural areas compared to boys, those with high prevalence, and residents in urban areas. Health education and the construction of a drinking water facility at Al Hidaib village also contributed to the reduction in infection rates. However, no significant change was observed in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection between baseline and follow-up surveys. At the end of the project, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by more than 50% compared to the baseline rate. Approximately 200,000 subjects received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or supply of clean water.
The matrix protein of Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus, plays a crucial role in viral assembly and budding. Contrary to the typical cytoplasmic replication of paramyxoviruses, the NiV matrix protein (NiV-M) is found in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) of NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished viral budding. A conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: mediating nuclear import and regulating nuclear export through monoubiquitination. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding, while depletion of free ubiquitin via proteasome inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding. Live Nipah virus budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, reducing viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM. These findings suggest that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated viral budding. The study highlights the potential therapeutic application of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, against acute NiV infection.
The mechanisms by which nonenveloped viruses, such as poliovirus ( PV ), deliver their genomes into host cells are poorly understood due to technical difficulties in direct visualization of viral gene delivery and uncertainties in distinguishing productive and nonproductive pathways. To address this knowledge gap, researchers combined an imaging assay that tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity-based assay for RNA release to characterize the early events in PV infection. The study found that PV genome release is highly efficient and rapid, and thus does not limit the overall infectivity or infection rate. The results define a pathway in which PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine kinase- and actin-dependent, endocytic mechanism. Genome release occurs immediately after internalization of the virus particle from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100–200 nm of the plasma membrane. This study settles a long-standing debate on whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. The imaging assay used in this study is expected to be broadly applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for nonenveloped viruses.
In rural Cambodia, dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, particularly among children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) relies heavily on health education as a means of prevention and control. However, an ethnographic study conducted in eastern Cambodia in 2003-2004 revealed that community and school-based health education for dengue control is insufficient, under-funded, and irregular. Community health education is delivered through outreach activities and campaigns, but lacks systematic evaluation and follow-up. School-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial. The study highlights the need for sustained routine education and approaches to ensure the translation of knowledge into practice. Local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education, offer potential to reduce dengue prevalence, but are hindered by poorly resourced and episodic health education. Political commitment and availability of educational resources are also critical factors impacting outreach activities. The study suggests that existing dengue health education messages, materials, and strategies must be redefined to be practical, applicable, and relevant, and that health practitioners require training in health education techniques to effectively deliver health education.
This study investigated the presence of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the host bloodstream. Filarial nematodes cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. The researchers used miRNA deep-sequencing and bioinformatics to identify over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. Two miRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR-34, were detected in D. immitis-infected dog plasma using stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. These miRNAs were also found in Brugia pahangi-infected dog samples. The presence of miR-71 and miR-34 discriminated infected samples from uninfected samples. However, the absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia for either parasite. This may be due to the imprecision of mf counts to estimate infection intensity or to miRNA contributions from the unknown number of adult worms present. The study suggests that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs are present in plasma or serum even for species that do not live in the bloodstream. The findings have implications for the development of novel diagnostic tools for filarial infections.
The article presents a computational study on the conformational activation of Src kinases, a family of large allosteric enzymes involved in cellular signaling. A coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain was constructed using experimental structures of the inactive and active states, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the transition energy landscapes. Two major ensembles of pathways for activation were identified from the structural network constructed from the simulations. The first pathway involves a coordinated switching mechanism among the αC helix, activation-loop, and β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In the second pathway, the conformational change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region of the catalytic domain. A detailed analysis of the switching mechanism for the αC helix and activation-loop was also performed. Additionally, a Markov model was tested to account for the structural kinetics in the context of Src conformational changes. The results provide a broad framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation. The study employed a structure-based coarse-grained model to investigate the Src conformational changes on the free energy landscapes, allowing for the exploration of the detailed conformational landscape by clustering the configurational space and constructing a structural network from simulations. The large-scale motions in the Src conformational activation occur on a relatively slow timescale, which is beyond the reach of brute-force all-atom simulations.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype can result in F1 lethality due to dosage-sensitive incompatibility, which plays a role in polyploid speciation. Researchers have identified variation in F1 lethality in interploidy crosses and determined the genetic architecture of the maternally expressed variation via QTL mapping. A single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 ( DSL1 ), was identified along with two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1. DSL1 affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants. The simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations suggest that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring. Loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 isolated from both the Ler and Col backgrounds improved interploidy crossing success, and the degree of rescue provided by a loss-of-function allele in Col was many-fold greater than in Ler.
The study investigated the coevolutionary patterns of Bartonella and Leptospira bacteria with their mammalian hosts, specifically bats and rodents. Using genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats, the researchers generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria. The results showed significant coevolutionary congruence between Bartonella and both rodent and bat hosts at a global level. In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant. Event-cost results supported the global-fit findings, with the rodent-Bartonella and bat-Bartonella associations having the least number of host switches per parasite, indicating greater evolutionary congruence over time. The study also found that Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching in both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has a high number of host switches. These variable coevolutionary patterns are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. The study suggests that understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow for better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans.
A forced damped oscillation framework was applied to a chain-link model of undulatory swimming to investigate the relationship between muscle forcing and deformation kinematics leading to movement. The study aimed to understand whether complex muscle forcing is necessary to produce the observed deformation kinematics in undulatory swimmers. By considering swimming as a forced damped oscillation problem, the researchers found that the forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause translational motion. The study showed that relatively simple forcing patterns can lead to complex deformation kinematics resulting in movement. The forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator was found to be crucial in determining the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. A closed-form expression for swimming velocity was derived through a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion. The results suggest that the power generated from muscle work is used to create body deformations, which are then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. The study provides a unified understanding of swimming, encompassing both active and passive swimming, and offers insights into the optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming. The findings were confirmed by fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations and are consistent with prior results on the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed.
This study investigated the potential for genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals to generate new strains of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), responsible for sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) in East Africa. The human infectivity of Tbr is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which can be transferred to the animal pathogen Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) through sexual reproduction. The study used genetically-engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines to track the inheritance of SRA in crosses between Tbr and Tbb transmitted through tsetse flies. The results showed that SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds, creating new strains of the human pathogen Tbr. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of hybrid trypanosomes carrying SRA. The study also found that SRA exists as a single copy in a representative collection of Tbr strains and is located on one homologue of chromosome IV in the majority of Tbr isolates examined. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. The study concludes that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.
The study investigated the role of gap junction coupling in the dysfunction of β-cells in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a condition characterized by disrupted insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells in the islets of Langerhans plays a crucial role in coordinating a pulsatile secretory response at elevated glucose levels and suppressing insulin secretion at basal glucose levels. The study used a murine model of NDM involving expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels and a multi-cellular computational model of islet electrical activity to examine the mechanisms by which gap junction coupling contributes to islet dysfunction in NDM. The results showed that reductions in gap junction coupling allow for progressively greater glucose-stimulated calcium ([Ca2+]) and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. The computational model demonstrated good correspondence between suppression of [Ca2+] and clinical presentation of different NDM mutations. Furthermore, the model predicted significant recoveries in [Ca2+] and insulin secretion for many mutations upon reductions in gap junction coupling, where stochastic noise played a significant role in the recoveries. These findings provide new understanding of how the islet functions as a multicellular system and suggest novel therapeutic options for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes. The study highlights the importance of gap junction channels in exacerbating the effects of decreased cellular excitability and suggests that reducing gap junction coupling may recover islet function and blunt diabetes caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8.
Predicting the dynamic behavior of large gene transcription networks from the behavior of their composing modules is a significant challenge in systems and synthetic biology. A major obstacle to achieving this predictive ability is the context-dependent behavior of modules, which is influenced by retroactivity. Retroactivity is a phenomenon that affects the dynamic performance of a module when it is connected to other modules. To address this issue, the authors develop an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. This framework is based on three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters and the modules' topology. The internal retroactivity matrix quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics, while the scaling and mixing retroactivity matrices describe how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. Using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, the authors can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. The authors also provide a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be used to assess the extent of modularity in natural networks and to design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity in synthetic systems. The authors illustrate the implications of retroactivity on the performance of various network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif.
The human pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) is a short region of homology between the X and Y chromosomes that undergoes rapid evolution. A crossover in PAR1 is essential for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis, and its deletion results in male sterility. The PAR1 region has an exceptionally high male crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. To investigate recombination in this region, researchers constructed a fine-scale genetic map using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates inferred from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells. The results show that PRDM9 localizes peaks of recombination in the human PAR1, in contrast to mice. Recombination is a more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than on autosomes, and hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. The study also found evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between humans and chimpanzees, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots. The genetic maps built and validated in this work are expected to aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome. The findings suggest that PRDM9 remains responsible for positioning recombination events in humans, but other factors may aid this protein in producing a high overall crossover rate.
A new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A, lacking the N-terminal demethylase domain (ΔN-JMJD2A), plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In proliferating myoblasts, muscle-specific genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications, including histone H3K9 methylation, at their promoters. The derepression of the promoter of the myogenic factor myogenin (Myog) is essential for the initiation of muscle differentiation. However, the mechanism of H3K9 demethylation at the Myog promoter was unclear. Genome-wide expression profiling and exon-specific siRNA knockdown revealed that ΔN-JMJD2A is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. ΔN-JMJD2A promotes MyoD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells and binds to genes mainly involved in transcriptional control, leading to gene activation. ChIP-on-chip analysis showed that ΔN-JMJD2A is recruited to the Myog promoter at the onset of differentiation, promoting the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. This study demonstrates that the induction of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation by directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, thus promoting transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and contributing to the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression. ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes induced specifically during skeletal muscle differentiation, and its binding to the Myog promoter regulates H3K9 methylation, allowing Myog expression and promoting myotube differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 reported cases in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end game, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is high. Using data from the GWEP, the study estimates the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986 to 2030. The study compares the GWEP to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing since 1986 and control (surveillance and outbreak response during 2016-2030). The results show that the GWEP costs an estimated $11 (95% uncertainty interval, $4.70-$12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at $222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. The study finds that the GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by 2030 and is certainly more cost-effective if the willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of Guinea worm disease exceeds $0.10. Even if economic costs are twice as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020, the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing.
The carboxy-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, termed BBK32-C, has been shown to bind and inhibit the initiating serine protease of the human classical complement pathway, C1r. This study investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues from the Lyme-associated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, designated BAD16 from B. afzelii strain PGau and BGD19 from B. garinii strain IP90. The results show that B. afzelii BAD16-C exhibits BBK32-C-like activities in all assays tested, including high-affinity binding to purified C1r protease and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. In contrast, recombinant B. garinii BGD19-C bound C1 and C1r with high-affinity but exhibited significantly reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities relative to BBK32-C or BAD16-C. The crystal structure of BBK32-C was solved to 1.7Å limiting resolution, revealing an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the helical core. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert BBK32-C to resemble BGD19-C at three residue positions, resulting in a chimeric protein that mimicked the properties observed for BGD19-C. The structure-function studies reported here improve our understanding of how BBK32 recognizes and inhibits C1r and provide new insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spirochetes of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex.
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes a morphological and transcriptional adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity. Previous studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, but the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role of post-translational phosphorylation in morphogenetic control, focusing on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The Fkh2 transcription factor was identified as a regulatory target of Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. Fkh2 undergoes a radical shift in its phosphorylation profile upon hyphal induction, mediated by Cdc28-Ccn1/Cln3 and Cbk1-Mob2. This shift activates Fkh2 to promote the expression of genes required for pathogenic processes. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. This study reveals a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, utilizes both de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Thymidine kinase ( TK ) is one of several salvage enzymes thought to be redundant to the de novo pathway. However, analysis of TK conditional null and RNAi cells revealed that TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and that a catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase ( DCTD ), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCTD rescued the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed for selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling showed a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy, suggesting the presence of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides. Bioinformatics analysis identified several potential candidate genes that could encode 5’-nucleotidase activity, including an HD-domain protein that catalyzes dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5’-monophosphates. These findings suggest that TK is essential for synthesis of thymine nucleotides regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage. The reliance on TK in the absence of DCTD may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids, providing a unique opportunity to selectively target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug.
The initiation of translation in prokaryotic systems typically requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, known as the ribosome-binding site or Shine-Dalgarno sequence. However, a large number of genes do not possess Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it is unknown how start codon recognition occurs in these mRNAs. To address this question, the authors performed genome-wide searches in various prokaryotes to identify sequence elements and/or RNA secondary structural motifs that could mediate translation initiation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgarno sequences. The results show that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence are generally less structured in their translation initiation region and exhibit a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, the authors provide experimental support for local RNA unfoldedness determining start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation. The data suggest that local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation. Furthermore, the authors found that AUG start codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal AUG codons are usually in structured regions of the mRNA. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site.
In Bihar, India, a region highly endemic for Leishmania donovani, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported a visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment program from July 2007 to August 2012. During this period, 8749 patients received 20 mg/kg intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) as first-line treatment, resulting in a high initial cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Of the 8311 patients completing treatment for their first episode of VL, 24 (0.3%) returned to the program complaining of symptoms subsequently confirmed as post-Kala-Azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The median time to development of PKDL was 1.2 years (interquartile range: 0.8-2.2) following treatment. Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients treated with Ambisome who later developed PKDL with those of the remaining cohort did not identify any significant risk factors for PKDL. However, the time to developing PKDL was significantly shorter with Ambisome than in a subset of patients presenting to the program with PKDL following previous sodium stibogluconate treatment for VL. This study demonstrates that PKDL following treatment for VL with 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) is a possibility in the Indian context, with no predictive risk factors identified. The shorter median time to developing symptoms of PKDL compared with that after conventional VL treatments should be taken into account when counseling patients treated with regimens including Ambisome.
Title: Spatial Re-Establishment Dynamics of Local Populations of Vectors of Chagas Disease
    Summary:
    Chagas disease prevention relies heavily on controlling the insect vectors that transmit the infection. However, these vectors have been resurgent in some areas, highlighting the need to understand the dynamics of reinfestation. A study analyzed the reinfestation of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. Continuous- and discrete-time models were fitted to patch-level infestation states to elucidate different aspects of re-establishment. The results showed a 6-month time lag between detection of a new infestation and dispersal events, and a seasonal increase in bug establishment from May to November, coinciding with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with increasing time since last detected infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov models for site-level transitions from uninfested to infested and vice versa were fitted to spatiotemporal population data of T. infestans. The models showed a strong seasonality in bug establishment on new sites by T. infestans, coincident with seasonality in dispersal distance. The study addresses three aspects relevant for population control of T. infestans: the establishment rate of new local populations as a function of distance from existing local populations, possible mechanisms for the observed seasonality in bug establishment, and the effect of insecticide spraying and previous infestation on establishment rates.
This study investigated the effects of polyomavirus SV40 microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in Syrian golden hamsters. The researchers inoculated outbred young adult hamsters with four different variants of SV40 and monitored viral DNA loads in various tissues from 3 to 270 days post-infection. The results showed that SV40 displayed a broad tissue tropism, infecting liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain tissues, with liver and kidney containing higher viral DNA loads. Kidneys were identified as the preferred site for long-term persistent infection, although detectable virus was also retained in livers. Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues, and microRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. The study also found that viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney, and infectious virus was detected infrequently. The study provides the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo and suggests that viral microRNA dampens viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions. The results also indicate that SV40 microRNA does not appear to affect SV40 tumorigenicity in hamsters.
This study presents the most comprehensive genome-wide examination of positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using six high-coverage genome assemblies of eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset allows for improved statistical power and the application of new lineage- and clade-specific tests. Of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, as well as more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and non-selection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs were found to be expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast were significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment of PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that forms biofilms on skin and mucosal surfaces. Biofilms are surface-associated communities that contribute to persistent infections. Researchers have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure composed of phenol soluble modulins ( PSMs ) that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers have amyloid-like properties and consist of small peptides called PSMs. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. In contrast, soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms while polymerized peptides do not. This suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. The fibers share morphological and biophysical characteristics with functional bacterial amyloids such as curli in Escherichia coli biofilms and TasA of Bacillus subtilis. Synthetic S. aureus PSM peptides can self-assemble into amyloid-like fibers in vitro, demonstrating CR and ThT binding capacities similar to known amyloid proteins. These findings implicate fibril formation as a means of altering PSM activity and function in the microenvironment of the biofilm. The discovery of amyloid-like fibers composed of PSMs provides new insights into the mechanisms of S. aureus biofilm formation and stability.
A novel antibody surrogate biomarker, Ab3, has been identified to monitor parasite persistence in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected patients. Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi, affects approximately six million individuals in over 20 countries. Current methods for monitoring parasite persistence, such as PCR testing, have limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. A multiplex serology assay was designed to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. The assay consisted of an array of 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens. One specific antibody response, Ab3, showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signals were associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in benznidazole-treated patients who cleared parasitemia. Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. It is hypothesized that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. A simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.
A recombinant Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre) has been developed to study the pathogenesis of CHIKV infection. CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre replicates in myoblasts and fibroblasts, inducing arthritis during the acute phase in mice. Importantly, it also induces chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis, similar to wild-type virus. Infection of tdTomato reporter mice with CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre results in a population of tdTomato+ cells that persist for at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling reveal that these cells predominantly consist of myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduces the number of tdTomato+ cells in the chronic phase and diminishes the levels of chronic viral RNA. Isolation and flow cytometry-based sorting of tdTomato+ fibroblasts from the skin and ankle reveal that these cells harbor most of the persistent CHIKV RNA at chronic time points. The CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system identifies the cells that survive CHIKV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent CHIKV RNA. This model represents a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
Title: Scaling Properties of Dimensionality Reduction for Neural Populations and Network Models
    Abstract: Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity gives rise to brain function. It is unclear, however, how the results obtained from dimensionality reduction generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how these results relate to the underlying network structure. We address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction—shared dimensionality and percent shared variance—with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.

   . These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction analyses in terms of limited neuron and trial sampling and underlying network structure. We focused on variability that is shared among simultaneously-recorded neurons. Shared variability has been widely studied due to its implications for the amount of information that is encoded by a population of neurons [25]

In this study, we used V1 recordings and spiking network models to understand how the results obtained using dimensionality reduction methods generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, as well as how these results relate to the underlying network structure

. First, because we can sample as many neurons and trials as desired from a spiking network model, we can measure how the outputs of dimensionality reduction vary over a wide range of neuron and trial counts. This allows us to assess whether the results obtained using a limited number of neurons and trials are representative of the larger network. Second, we can assess how these scaling trends are influenced by the known underlying network structure

. By contrast, the clustered network exhibited fewer dimensions, but those dimensions represented a large fraction of the overall variance ( Fig 6A ). These results suggest that FA provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial population activity than PCA. In this work, we studied spontaneous activity during in vivo recordings and in spiking network models

. We studied the scaling trends of shared dimensionality and percent shared variance with increasing numbers of neurons and trials. To perform this analysis we used spontaneous activity recorded in the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) of anesthetized macaque monkeys and activity generated from non-clustered and clustered spiking network models.
The study reveals that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing-regulated molecule 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA) modulates host immune responses in a manner that increases host ability to cope with this pathogen. Mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection showed a 90% survival rate compared to 10% survival rate in non-pretreated infected mice. 2-AA stimulation activates key innate immune response pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates immune response activation upon pretreatment by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. The study found that 2-AA host pretreatment is characterized by a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activation, with relatively preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. These kinase changes lead to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (c/EBPβ) activation and formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex that prevents NF-κB activation. The results suggest that 2-AA's ability to dampen inflammatory processes while increasing host survival and pathogen persistence concurs with its ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode. The study reveals a quorum sensing immunomodulatory signal that promotes original aspects of interkingdom communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection.
The L1TD1 gene, derived from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement, has been domesticated in mammals for its role in genome defense and pluripotency maintenance. The gene originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, approximately 106 million years ago, and has been conserved in its bipartite double-ORF1p organization since its birth. However, L1TD1 has been lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution, suggesting that it has been recurrently selected for functional novelty. In primates and mice, L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection, and one prosimian L1TD1 has replenished itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. The loss of L1TD1 is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents. This suggests that L1TD1 may have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and demonstrates that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages. Genome-wide searches revealed that L1TD1 has been lost on at least three separate occasions during the evolution of placental mammals, indicating that its retention is not solely due to its role in pluripotency maintenance. Instead, idiosyncratic L1 insertion patterns in different mammalian genomes may provide an explanation for the retention of L1TD1 in mammals without an active L1.
The highly conserved bacterial protein YbeY has been identified as an essential endoribonuclease in Vibrio cholerae, a human pathogen responsible for cholera. YbeY plays critical roles in virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control. In contrast to Escherichia coli, where YbeY is not essential, its loss in V. cholerae severely impairs the bacterium's ability to colonize mice, form biofilms, produce cholera toxin, and regulate virulence-associated small RNAs. Sucrose gradient analysis of V. cholerae ribosomes revealed that YbeY is the only RNase crucial for 3' processing of 16S rRNA and its assembly into 70S ribosomes. Depletion of YbeY in V. cholerae leads to the accumulation of 16S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits, indicating its importance in ribosome quality control. A phylogenetic comparison showed that YbeY is part of a small set of RNases essential in most representative pathogens, highlighting its conserved function across species. Furthermore, the ybeY genes of several distantly related pathogens can complement an E. coli ΔybeY strain under various stress conditions, demonstrating the high conservation of YbeY's activity in stress regulation. Overall, this study provides the first comprehensive exploration of YbeY's physiological role in a human pathogen, underscoring its importance in essential cellular processes.
The study investigated the relationship between the topological properties of human transcription factor networks (TFNs) and the robustness of their gene expression phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations. The authors used publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. They found that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. The assortativity signature is a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect, and it comprises four distinct components. The authors determined that each component of the assortativity signature contributes to the phenotypic robustness of TFNs. Theoretical work has shown that TFNs with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to mutations in cis-regulatory sites and gene duplication. The study suggests that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks, and that human TFNs share an assortativity signature that confers such robustness. The findings have implications for the theoretical understanding of networked systems and highlight the importance of considering the assortativity signature in the study of biological regulatory networks.
The study investigated how populations of inhibitory (INH) and excitatory (EXC) neocortical neurons collectively encode stimulus-related information in the anesthetized adult rat somatosensory barrel cortex. Using large-scale multi-electrode arrays, the activity of up to 74 neurons in all layers of 3-4 neighboring cortical columns was simultaneously recorded in response to whisker stimuli varying in location and frequency. The results showed that individual INH neurons discriminated better between restricted sets of stimuli than EXC neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. Furthermore, ensembles of INH cells provided as much information about the stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the most informative EXC neurons, but with less information redundancy. This suggests that a consortium of INH neurons dominates the information conveyed to the neocortical network, efficiently processing incoming sensory activity. The study found a higher level of stimulus-related information in both individual and groups of INH neurons compared to their EXC counterparts in granular and infra-granular layers, indicating a sharper tuning of their temporally-precise responses to different stimuli. The results propose that INH cell ensembles have a lower amount of redundancy compared to comparable ensembles containing the best EXC cells, and that L4 INH neurons convey more information about the different stimulus modalities than L4 EXC neurons due to their higher number of spikes per stimulus, higher precision, and lower adaptation at higher frequency stimulation.
The article reports the engineering of a genetic half adder in Escherichia coli based on de novo riboregulation to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations. The system exploits post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense the molecular signals. The designer circuit robustly performs the intended computation in a living cell, encoding the result as fluorescence amplitudes. This work demonstrates that regulatory RNAs can be key players in synthetic biology and paves the way for engineering more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this designer circuit as a building block. Unlike previous genetic half adders, the reporter gene conveying the sum is not duplicated, making the architecture better organized and more scalable. The genetic footprint of the designer circuit was also greatly reduced due to the use of regulatory RNAs compared to circuits fully implemented with transcription factors. The system is based on riboregulators of translation initiation and exploits the functional versatility and model-based designability of RNA at the nucleotide level. This work highlights the potential of RNA as an ideal substrate for engineering gene expression programs that robustly run in vivo. The designer circuit can be used as a building block for more complex RNA-based biocomputers and demonstrates the importance of regulatory RNAs in synthetic biology.
Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. However, high levels of cN-II expression have been correlated with poor patient outcomes in cancer therapy. To investigate the role of cN-II in resistance to cytotoxic nucleoside analogues, a class of chemical compounds called ribonucleoside phosphonates was screened as potential inhibitors. These compounds feature a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of the regular phosphoester bond. Six phosphonate analogues were identified as better ligands than the natural substrate, inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). The binding strength of these compounds was analyzed in silico and found to be influenced by van der Waals contacts with three cN-II residues: Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Experimental measurements confirmed that the three best phosphonate analogues induced a total inhibition of cN-II activity at 2 mM. The study highlights the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design of new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial role of hydrophobic stacking promoted by the three protein residues. The results suggest that nucleoside phosphonate derivatives represent a class of compounds that efficiently mimic nucleoside 5′-monophosphates and may serve as powerful cN-II inhibitors.
A recent study investigated the presence of prions in milk from ewes incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting ruminants. Contrary to previous findings, the study detected consistent levels of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes several months prior to clinical onset. Immunohistochemistry and PET blot analysis revealed abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) accumulation in lacteal ducts and mammary acini, particularly in ewes with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles resulting from Maedi lentivirus infection. However, prion infectivity was also detected in milk and colostrum from ewes with lesion-free mammary glands. Bioassay revealed that infectivity was present in all tested fractions of milk and colostrum, including cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions. The highest infectious titre measured in milk and colostrum was equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. These findings suggest that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to animal TSE transmission, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. The study raises concerns about the risk of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.
During the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, a total of 16,370 laboratory samples were tested between April 4, 2014, and March 29, 2015. Of these, 10,536 individuals were identified, with 3,897 confirmed cases (positive for Ebola virus RNA). The analysis revealed significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Young children and the elderly, as well as individuals residing in rural areas, were found to be at higher risk of death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. The data were collected and managed by EVD diagnostic laboratories, which were able to systematically register basic demographic and clinical information of patients. However, surveillance and reporting systems malfunctioned during the outbreak, resulting in inadequate data management, including missing and duplicate data. The findings of this study may contribute to a fuller understanding of the outbreak in Liberia and support future investigations. The data were collected as part of the Ebola public health response in Liberia and were not anonymized, as they were not collected for research purposes.
Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding ortho-quinone. The enzyme is generated as a complex with a “caddie” protein that facilitates the transport of two copper ions into the active center. In a previous study, the Tyr98 residue in the caddie protein was found to be converted to a reactive quinone through the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. To elucidate the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, cryo-trapped crystal structures were determined at high resolutions (1.16-1.70 Å). The structures revealed an important step in the tyrosinase reaction: the hydroxylation reaction is triggered by the movement of CuA, which induces the syn-to-anti rearrangement of the copper ligands after the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) core. This rearrangement places the hydroxyl group of the substrate in an equatorial position, allowing electrophilic attack by the Cu2O2 oxidant. UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. The study proposes a catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase toward the caddie Tyr98 residue, in which the coordination preference determined by the oxidation state of copper and the protonation state triggers the generation of reaction intermediates. The binding position of the caddie Tyr98 residue may differ from that of a genuine substrate.
The Npa1p complex plays a crucial role in the assembly of the earliest eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit precursor. The first specific precursor to the yeast large ribosomal subunit, the first pre-60S particle, contains 30 assembly factors ( AFs ), including 8 RNA helicases. One of these helicases, Dbp6p, is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S pre-ribosomal particle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Dbp6p helicase associates with a complex of four AFs, namely Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, prior to their incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p forms the backbone of this complex and is essential for the stable integration of Dbp6p within the initial 90S pre-ribosomal particle. The Npa1p complex is necessary not only for the stable integration of the Dbp6p helicase at the correct site within 90S pre-ribosomal particles but also for the modulation of its enzymatic activities. In vivo cross-linking analysis revealed that Npa1p binds to 25S rRNA adjacent to the root helices of the first and last secondary structure domains of 25S rRNA, suggesting that Npa1p and Dbp6p function in the formation and/or clustering of root helices of large subunit rRNAs. The Npa1p complex also cross-links to snoRNAs involved in decoding center and peptidyl transferase center modifications and in the immediate vicinity of the binding sites of these snoRNAs on 25S rRNA. These findings suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions.
The present study investigated the role of catecholamines in learning rate regulation in a dynamic environment. Catecholamines, including norepinephrine and dopamine, are neuromodulators that have been implicated in various cognitive processes, but their involvement in learning rate regulation remains poorly understood. The study employed a predictive-inference task to examine the relationship between catecholamine activity and learning rate in 32 participants. The results showed that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and formally mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. Furthermore, P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of unexpectedness of an outcome and uncertainty of a preexisting belief on learning rate. A pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants’ baseline learning rate. These findings provide converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. The study suggests that the phasic catecholamine response following surprising outcomes drives subsequent increases in learning rate, and that the catecholamine systems are involved in incorporating new unexpected observations into beliefs about the causal structure of the environment.
A syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC was implemented in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases using data from Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Saloum region of Senegal, and a homemade syndromic surveillance system, EPIMIC, was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data from the POC laboratory of the Timone hospital in Marseille, France. The study aimed to describe the implementation of EPIMIC using data from two POC laboratories in rural Senegal. Over five years, 2,577 patients-samples couples from 775 different patients were tested in the Dielmo and Ndiop POC laboratories, with 739 patients-samples couples found to be positive for at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the data with EPIMIC generated 443 alarms. In the Niakhar POC laboratory, 316 patients-samples couples from 298 different patients were processed, with 56 patients-samples couples found to be positive for at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the data with EPIMIC generated 14 alarms. EPIMIC was successfully implemented in rural Senegal using data from two POC laboratories, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. The system detected numerous true epidemiological events without requiring heavy human and economic resources. EPIMIC's main asset is its ability to survey 27 POC tests for 15 pathogens in near real-time. Further improvements are needed to enhance the EPIMIC syndromic surveillance network.
The study investigated the role of cellular architecture in collective calcium signaling and cell contractility in endothelial cells. Using a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning, the researchers found that endothelial cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks exhibited calcium oscillations in response to histamine stimulation, whereas individual cells and monolayers did not. The calcium oscillation was found to depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication. This suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling. The study also found that the calcium oscillation attenuated histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. Computational modeling revealed that the intracellular calcium dynamics driven by calcium-induced calcium release were highly sensitive to the cytosolic calcium concentration, and that the membrane potential and coupling current created oscillations in coupled cells. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the architecture-dependent calcium signaling in endothelial cells and highlight the importance of cellular architecture in regulating collective calcium signaling and cell contractility. The study's results have implications for understanding the functional implications of diverse vascular structures in response to external stimuli.
Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Previous studies have elucidated the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection in infants using whole genome-fragment phage display libraries ( GFPDL ). These libraries expressed linear and conformational epitopes from RSV that bound 100-fold more phages within the attachment protein ( G ) following primary RSV infection. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-termini of G ectodomain, in addition to the central conserved domain ( CCD ). This study examined the contribution of antigenic regions of G outside of the CCD to RSV-specific immunity. The immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection were evaluated using recombinant E. coli expressed G ectodomain ( REG ), CCD-deleted G ectodomain ( REG ΔCCD ), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides. The results showed that REG ΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian expressed G ectodomain ( RMG ) and intact RSV virion particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared with the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A2 Line 19F, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmunized controls. Control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles. These data demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD that could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.
This study investigates the role of the splicing component brr2 in the specification of Drosophila neuropeptidergic neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons of the ventral nerve cord. The Tv4 neurons receive a target-derived BMP signal from their target cells, which acts as the final trigger to activate the FMRFa gene. A genetic screen identified brr2 as one of the genes involved in Tv4 specification, along with Prp8, another component of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome. The study found that brr2 and Prp8 play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC ( Tv4 neurons ). Detailed analysis revealed that brr2 controls the activation of the BMP retrograde signaling pathway in Tv4 neurons through two independent mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive the BMP ligand and proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway, tkv and Medea. The study also found that brr2 is involved in three different steps necessary for Tv4 neuron specification: axon pathfinding, Dimm expression, and activation of the BMP signaling pathway. The results suggest that brr2 plays a cell-specific role in controlling the specification of the neuropeptidergic identity of the Tv4 neuron in the embryonic Drosophila Central Nervous System. This study provides new insights into the molecular genetic aspects of retrograde instructive signals during nervous system development and highlights the importance of RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
The regulation of substrate receptor subunits of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) is crucial for maintaining the full repertoire of CRLs, as unbalanced levels can lead to sequestration of CRL core components by a few overabundant substrate receptors. A novel pathway for regulating F-box protein abundance has been identified, which targets F-box proteins that are dissociated from Skp1. This pathway involves the SCF core components Cdc53 and Rbx1, as well as the cognate SCF ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Notably, this ubiquitylation pathway is independent of Skp1, suggesting a function of Cdc53/Cul1 that is independent from association with Skp1. The ‘Skp1-free’ F-box protein degradation pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. This pathway specifically targets Met30, the substrate adaptor for SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase, which negatively regulates transcription factor Met4 by proteolysis-independent ubiquitylation. The identification of this novel pathway highlights the complexity of CRL regulation and assigns important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of F-box protein abundance and the role of Cdc53/Cul1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Mammalian Kinesin-3 Motors Are Dimeric In Vivo and Move by Processive Motility upon Release of Autoinhibition. Kinesin-3 motors, such as KIF1A, drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. Previous models suggested that KIF1A is monomeric in the inactive state and is activated by concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. However, this study found that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in the inactive state, contradicting the cargo-induced dimerization model. Instead, KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms, which can be released upon cargo binding. Successive truncations of KIF1A resulted in monomeric and dimeric motors that can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice, but only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. The study shows that dimeric KIF1A motors move smoothly and unidirectionally along microtubules with an average velocity comparable to vesicles moving in vivo. The findings suggest that KIF1A may use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. The results have implications for understanding how kinesin motors are regulated to enable transport of the correct cargo to the proper cellular destination at the relevant time.
Metabolic profiling and network analysis were applied to 76 tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in two consecutive harvest seasons to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and estimate the degree of metabolic natural variability. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL). Amino acid contents displayed a high degree of variability across the population, with similar patterns across the two seasons, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Integration of data for tomato pericarp metabolite profiling revealed that the main factor for metabolic polymorphism was the genotypic background rather than the environment or tissue. Analysis of the coefficient of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the ILs than in the M82 tomato cultivar. Broad-sense estimate of heritability suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis comparing metabolite data for the seed with that for the pericarp showed that the seed network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit. Amino acids in the seed metabolic network played a central hub-like role, maintaining high interactions with other metabolite categories. Network analysis identified six exceptionally highly co-regulated amino acids: Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro. These results reflect the extensive redundancy of the regulation underlying seed metabolism, demonstrate the tight coordination of seed metabolism with respect to fruit metabolism, and emphasize the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network. The study highlights the added value of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping.
The N-acetylglucosamine binding protein GbpA plays a crucial role in the colonization of Vibrio cholerae to both chitinous exoskeletons of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. GbpA has been reported to mediate bacterial attachment to marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin, but the molecular mechanism behind this interaction was unknown. Structural studies revealed that GbpA possesses an elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen demonstrated that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides, and structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants showed that domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro. In vivo complementation studies revealed that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial binding studies showed that domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays demonstrated that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These findings explain how GbpA provides structural/functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons. The study provides new insights into the molecular properties governing GbpA's ability to mediate interactions between the bacteria and host surfaces in both marine and mammalian environments.
In a study on pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying chronic T cell activation, a hallmark of the disease. They found that circulating natural regulatory T cells (Treg) in adults with PTB preserve their suppressive potential, but T effector cells (Teff) from these subjects are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. This resistance was attributed to the expansion of an activated Teff subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR expression. Depletion of this subset restored sensitivity to suppression to control levels. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed putative resistance mechanisms linked to IFNG, IL17A, IL22, PD-L1, and β-chemokines CCL3L3, CCL4 expression. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed that HLA-DR+ Teff cells, but not the fraction depleted of HLA-DR+ effectors, are resistant to Treg suppression mediated via CCR5 and PD-L1 associated pathways. Furthermore, HLA-DR+ Teff cells expressed significantly higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which may regulate Treg function through a reciprocal counter-balancing relationship. These findings provide novel insight into how activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells may contribute to disease-associated inflammation by compromising Treg-mediated suppression in PTB. The study identifies HLA-DR+ Teff cells resistant to Treg suppression as a potential functional marker of disease, with implications for disease monitoring and response to therapy.
The study investigated the propagation of RML prions in mice expressing PrPC devoid of a GPI anchor (tgGPI- mice). These mice are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrPSc outside the cell, rather than intracellularly. The researchers found that RML and ME7 prions, but not 22L prions, propagated in tgGPI- mice developed novel cell tropisms, as determined by the Cell Panel Assay (CPA). Surprisingly, the levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) in RML- or ME7-infected tgGPI- brain were 25-50 times higher than in wild-type brain. When returned to wild-type brain, ME7 prions recovered their original properties, but RML prions gave rise to a novel prion strain, designated SFL, which remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice. This suggests that the two conformations are separated by a high activation energy barrier that is abrogated in tgGPI- mice. The study also found that RML prions from wild-type brain propagated in tgGPI- mice gave rise to a GPI-PrPSc conformer that adapted to the environment and, when transferred to wild-type mice, stably maintained a novel conformation of wild-type PrPSc, distinct from the original RML.
The BMP signaling pathway plays a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development in Drosophila. Graded BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. Using a combination of RNA-seq and Mad and Brinker ChIP-seq, the study identifies multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. EGF signaling is found to negatively regulate embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. The BMP gene network has a self-regulating property, establishing a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. The study also identifies key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein shows reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling. The findings are incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed in relation to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates. The study provides new insights into the transcriptional responses downstream of the major developmental BMP signaling pathway in the Drosophila embryo, shedding light on the complex interplay between BMP and EGF signaling during dorsal-ventral axis patterning.
In Tunisia, the incidence of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major has been increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To better understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, researchers conducted a multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from three endemic governorates (Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) collected over two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012. Analysis of the genotyping results showed that L. major populations in Sidi Bouzid evolved over two decades, generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates suggest that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, contradicting a geographical gradient. Instead, human activities may be the source of the disease expansion. The study also found previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts, which could be attributed to human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes. The findings provide new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia, which may improve understanding of parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
The study evaluated the effectiveness of anthelmintic chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene ( WASH ) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. A cohort study nested within a randomized trial of empiric deworming found that repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) species. The odds of infection with any STH species were lower for individuals treated with albendazole ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR ) : 0. 11, 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0. 05, 0. 20, p < 0. 001 ), adjusting for age and sex. While most WASH conditions showed minimal additional benefit in reducing the probability of infection with any STH species, access to safe flooring appeared to offer some additional protection ( aOR : 0. 34, 95% CI : 0. 20, 0. 56, p < 0. 001 ). For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective ( aOR : 0. 30, 95% CI : 0. 14, 0. 60, p = 0. 001 ). Among individuals not treated with albendazole or praziquantel, the most protective intervention package included safe flooring ( aOR : 0. 34, 95% CI : 0. 20, 0. 59, p < 0. 001 ) and latrine access ( aOR : 0. 59, 95% CI : 0. 35, 0. 99, p = 0. 05 ). There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthelmintic chemotherapy and WASH resources.
The crystal structure of LlpABW, a lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, has been elucidated, revealing an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain (C-domain) adopts a fold similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. In contrast, the N-terminal MMBL domain (N-domain) adopts the same fold but is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. Engineered N/C-domain chimeras derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra suggest that the N-domain determines target specificity. The bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity. LlpABW is the first prokaryotic member of the MMBL lectin family, which is typically associated with eukaryotic proteins involved in general defense mechanisms. The N-domain appears to play a major role in target selection, while the C-domain is essential for bactericidal activity. The bacteriocin's activity is not impaired in the presence of excess mannose, suggesting that mannose-containing carbohydrates may not be the natural ligand required for biological activity.
During the sporulation process in Bacillus subtilis, a novel secretion apparatus plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and developmental gene expression of the forespore. This apparatus is composed of eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ, which form a multimeric complex spanning the two membranes surrounding the forespore. The SpoIIIA proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems, including type II and IV secretion systems, and the conserved ATPase motifs in SpoIIIAA are required for σG activity and spore formation. The SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex is essential for maintaining forespore integrity, as its absence leads to large invaginations and collapse of the forespore. Notably, the maintenance of forespore integrity does not require σG activity, indicating that forespore collapse is not a result of the failure to activate σG. The findings suggest that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore, allowing the mother cell to nurture the forespore and maintain its physiology during spore maturation. This apparatus appears to have been assembled from components of various specialized secretion systems found in Gram-negative bacteria. The discovery of this novel secretion apparatus provides new insights into the complex process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,191 bipolar disorder (BD) cases and 1,434 controls was conducted to identify genetic variants associated with the disease. The study did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci, but found an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous GWAS and evidence for replication (P=1.5×10−7). This suggests that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies. The study also found that SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. A meta-analysis of height data showed that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. These results provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies. Bipolar disorder is a major psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population, characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression, and has a high heritability but has not easily yielded genetic loci from family and population-based mapping strategies. Multiple GWAS have highlighted compelling candidates for BD without reaching genome-wide significance. The study's findings suggest that larger studies may be able to identify genetic signals in circumscribed regions of the genome that would not be captured by single locus analyses in a single GWAS data set at genome-wide significance levels.
Title: A Genome-Wide Systematic Analysis Reveals Different and Predictive Proliferation Expression Signatures of Cancerous vs. Non-Cancerous Cells

    A genome-wide analysis of 12690 genes across 60 cancer cell lines was conducted to identify genes and cellular processes associated with cancer proliferation. The Cancer Proliferation Index (cPI) was used to quantify the association between gene expression levels and growth rate measurements. Genes found essential in cancer gene knockdown screens exhibited significant positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors showed significant negative cPI values. Cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production-related processes were positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration was negatively associated with it.

    A parallel analysis of non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed marked differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. Genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries were identified as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins. A cross-species comparison revealed that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures led to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer.

    The study identified 200 genes with the highest dPI values, which were enriched in genes belonging to the translation and spliceosome machineries. Cancer-related genes, including tumor suppressors and oncogenes, exhibited higher absolute cPI values. Tumor suppressor genes showed significantly lower and negative cPI values, indicating that their decreased functionality may enhance cellular proliferation. The results provide insights into the inherent differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants, which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular cystic echinococcosis (CE) was conducted over a 15-year period (1995–2009). The main clinical manifestations included thoracic pain or dyspnea, although two patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were primarily located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients had previously been diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, supplemented by serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median duration of 25 months. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination, while two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement exclusively did not experience complications after surgery and were considered cured, whereas those with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolisms and presented multiple complications. Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, whereas endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications. CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas.
The study investigated the role of TirS, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) mimic in Staphylococcus aureus, in modulating virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. Ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection, skin lesions induced by a tirS mutant strain increased compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite similar bacterial loads. TirS was associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, indicating a central role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses. TirS localized within staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance but not always carrying the mecA gene. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increased tirS expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between TirS and clinical presentation but showed a selective advantage with a SCCmec element containing SCC fusC/tirS. The study suggests that TirS modulates an inflammatory response at the site of infection through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and its expression is linked to fusidic acid resistance. The findings indicate that TirS plays a key role in S. aureus virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility, and its interaction with MyD88 may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
The study analyzed transcriptional datasets from Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Anopheles gambiae (malaria mosquito) to identify whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying differences in their embryonic morphologies. The researchers found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes specifically expressed in the mosquito serosa, which is an extra-embryonic tissue. This cluster was also found to be redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. Additionally, a striking difference was observed in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes. In Drosophila, these genes exhibited a sharp reduction at the maternal-zygotic transition, whereas in Anopheles, they displayed sustained expression. The study proposes that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used to identify the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. The researchers used a computational framework to align and compare transcriptional datasets from the two species, revealing distinctive patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including the organization of extra-embryonic tissues and the maternal-zygotic transition. The findings suggest that this approach can be used for the de novo identification of functional gene sets from comparative datasets.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural villages of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens. The study found that 21% of asymptomatic participants had detectable H. ducreyi DNA on their skin, with no significant difference in positivity rates between those exposed or not exposed to a case of H. ducreyi ulcer in the household. Additionally, 90% of flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA, and 50% had T. p. pertenue DNA. Furthermore, 33% of bed sheets sampled had H. ducreyi DNA, and 17% had T. p. pertenue DNA. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of H. ducreyi DNA and colonization on the skin of asymptomatic children and the presence of H. ducreyi DNA and T. p. pertenue DNA in flies and on fomites. The ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism. The study also found that asymptomatic children living in H. ducreyi-endemic communities had detectable H. ducreyi DNA on their skin, with no evidence of cutaneous ulceration or other symptoms. Notably, people from households without an ulcer case had positivity rates similar to those with an H. ducreyi ulcer case in the household.
The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee’s Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training needs and curricula across various user personas and training programs. These competencies were initially developed through surveys of employers and training programs and have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. The core competencies aim to assist educators in sharing experiences and identifying best practices for bioinformatics education despite divergent needs and expectations. A series of use cases illustrates the application of the competencies in diverse training contexts, demonstrating their value in defining, refining, or assessing bioinformatics training mechanisms. These use cases highlight a range of training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings. The competencies are not intended to be a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs. The core competencies provide a foundation for bioinformatics training and education, enabling educators to tailor their programs to meet the needs of various user groups, including researchers, clinicians, and students. The ISCB Education Committee continues to refine and apply the core competencies to improve bioinformatics training and education globally.
The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis has a unique life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms, which can be leveraged to investigate the mechanisms of its developmentally arrested third-stage larva ( L3i ). Unlike other parasitic nematodes, S. stercoralis has a similar developmentally arrested larval form, the dauer, whose formation is controlled by four pathways in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans : cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) signaling, insulin/IGF-1-like signaling ( IIS ), transforming growth factor β ( TGFβ ) signaling, and biosynthesis of dafachronic acid ( DA ) ligands. The authors hypothesized that homologous pathways are present in S. stercoralis, have similar developmental regulation, and are involved in L3i arrest and activation. A deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome generated over 2. 3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages of S. stercoralis. The results showed that genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately up-regulated in L3i, while S. stercoralis has a paucity of genes encoding IIS ligands. Seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand were identified, three of which are only expressed in L3i. Putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. The data suggest that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3i development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies.
This study investigated the effects of bacterial genotoxins, specifically Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. The researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including Helicobacter-infected mice, coculture experiments, and xenograft mouse-derived models. The results showed that CDT and colibactin induced the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells, which correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of the NR was found to concentrate ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the mCRD complex involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling. The formation of these structures is dynamic, transient, and protects the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. The study suggests that bacterial genotoxins-induced NR may serve as a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be transported and translated within the nucleus. The findings provide new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers, which can occur in response to genotoxic bacteria and may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapies and some chemotherapies.
This study aimed to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). Ten former patients with leprosy and five control subjects underwent 3D-CT scans, and three-dimensional images centered on the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction methods. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA-P) was measured, and the difference between the MA-P of patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for individual skull size. The results showed that three former patients with lepromatous leprosy exhibited marked atrophy of the maxilla at the prosthion, which corresponded with the visual appearance of the maxillary deformity. These findings were consistent with paleopathological studies of excavated skeletal remains. Additionally, the precise bone defects of the maxilla could be individually calculated for accurate reconstructive surgery. The study also confirmed the maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies. The use of 3D-CT enabled the evaluation of maxillary bone deformities both qualitatively and quantitatively, providing a promising tool for the quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities associated with leprosy and other maxillary lesions. This approach may contribute to novel surgical treatments for facial deformity and eliminate social segregation and prejudice attributed to leprosy.
The study investigated how the auditory system constructs noise-invariant representations of sound in the presence of background noise. To address this challenge, the researchers measured neuronal responses to complex sounds embedded in stationary noise in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets. The results show that the strength of adaptation to the mean and contrast of auditory stimulation increases as one ascends the auditory pathway, from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex. This suggests that adaptation to stimulus statistics is a neural mechanism that drives the construction of noise-tolerant representations of sound. The study used a decoding approach to assess the noise tolerance of the neuronal population code and found that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. Furthermore, noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus statistics, indicating that populations that show the strongest adaptation to stimulus statistics are also the most noise-tolerant. The findings suggest that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain. Overall, the study provides evidence for the role of adaptation to stimulus statistics in enabling the auditory system to represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion.
The study investigated the effects of heat shock on the protein-protein interaction network (interactome) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-characterized model organism. The researchers used a systems-level approach to analyze the changes in the interactome topology upon heat shock. They calculated the interaction weights of the yeast interactome from mRNA expression levels and found that heat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules. This resulted in a 4.9-fold increase in the weighted diameter of the yeast interactome. The study identified several key proteins of the heat shock response that became centers of local communities and bridges providing residual connections between modules after heat shock. The changes in the interactome structure were likened to a'stratus-cumulus' transition, with the unstressed interactome having a globally connected organization and the heat-shocked interactome having a multifocal organization. The results suggest that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome, which may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes. The study also found that other complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, may exhibit similar changes in response to stress, leading to a partial disintegration of their global structure.
A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in patients with Chagas disease and ventricular arrhythmias. The review included 9 studies ( 3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized controlled trial ), with 2 studies providing individual patient data for analysis. The results showed that amiodarone significantly reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes ( 99.9%, 95% CI 99.8-100% ), ventricular premature beats ( 93.1%, 95% CI 82-97.4% ), and the incidence of ventricular couplets ( 79%, RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11-0.39 ) in 24-hour Holter recordings. The pooled incidence of adverse side effects associated with amiodarone use included corneal microdeposits ( 61.1%, 95% CI 19.0-91.3 ), gastrointestinal events ( 16.1%, 95% CI 6.6-34.2 ), sinus bradycardia ( 12.7%, 95% CI 3.7-35.5 ), dermatological events ( 10.6%, 95% CI 4.8-21.9 ), and drug discontinuation ( 7.7%, 95% CI 4.2-13.7 ). The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The findings suggest that amiodarone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease, but there is no direct evidence for its effect on hard endpoints such as sudden death or hospitalization.
The study examined the seasonal patterns of dengue fever in rural Ecuador from 2009 to 2016 using medical record data from two hospitals. A Poisson generalized linear model was used to determine short- and long-term seasonal patterns, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays on dengue fever diagnoses. The results showed that dengue fever cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. A separate model examining the effect of climate on diagnosis patterns found that monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days were significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses. This study provides the first report of long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador and highlights the importance of considering both climatic and non-climatic factors in understanding dengue fever trends. The results can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
Transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in mice has been shown to profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. This results in a life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and confers profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection. The RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. The results demonstrate that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection. RdRP mice possess a maximally upregulated innate immune transcriptome, capable of effecting a robust antiviral response, which far exceeds the innate immune gene inductions produced by virus infection itself. The resulting activation of cell-intrinsic innate immunity culminates in production of type I interferons and activation of a large class of potent antiviral factors, collectively termed ISGs.
The effective population size (Ne) of a plant RNA virus determines the strength of genetic drift and the frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes. However, experimental estimates of Ne for different plant viruses have yielded diverging results. The independent action hypothesis (IAH) proposes that each virion has a probability of infection and acts independently of other virions during the infection process. A corollary of IAH is that Ne must be dose-dependent. This study tested the IAH infection model using Tobacco etch virus (TEV) variants carrying fluorescent markers in Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants. The results showed that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency. The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf and systemically infecting the plant was near 1. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the mean number of primary infection foci using the independent-action model. The study found that independent action holds for TEV, and Ne is therefore dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, approaching 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency in TEV suggests that comparison of Ne estimates for different viruses may not be meaningful unless dose effects are taken into consideration.
The study presents a new approach to understanding the genetic control of gene expression using a Bayesian multi-tissue method. Traditional expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) studies have been conducted in single tissues or cell types, ignoring shared information across tissues. The authors propose a Sparse Bayesian Regression model for mapping eQTLs within individual tissues and simultaneously across tissues. This approach was tested on 2, 000 genes in four tissues and demonstrated increased power in revealing the complexity of the eQTL landscape compared to traditional methods. The study identified a two-eQTL model for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and not detected by conventional approaches. Additionally, the authors found common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for approximately 27% of transcripts, resulting in a >5-fold increase in eQTL detection compared to single-tissue analyses at a 5% false discovery rate ( FDR ) level. The proposed method provides a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression and has broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes. The approach is adaptable to other model systems and humans, making it a valuable tool for understanding the genetic control of gene expression. The study also highlights the power of the method in identifying polygenic regulation of gene expression and secondary trans-eQTLs.
A mathematical model of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway has been developed to understand the variable-delay, snap-action switch that controls cell death in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The model is based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways and was trained against experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, allowing for the study of switching mechanisms in detail. Analysis of the model shows that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved through reactions involved in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. The pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are critical for snap-action control. The model suggests that the dynamics of initiator caspase and effector caspase substrate cleavage are key to understanding where in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway a steady increase in caspase-8 activity is converted into a snap-action downstream signal.
The Listeria monocytogenes protein Internalin P (InlP) plays a critical role in the bacterium's ability to infect the placenta during pregnancy. InlP is a secreted virulence factor that interacts with the human protein afadin, which is associated with cell-cell junctions. The interaction between InlP and afadin enhances the ability of Listeria monocytogenes to cross the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a process known as transcytosis. This process is necessary for the bacterium to cross the basement membrane and infect the fetus. The crystal structure of InlP reveals an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a distinctive Ca2+-binding site, which is essential for its interaction with afadin. Listeria monocytogenes mutants lacking InlP (ΔinlP) or expressing an internal in-frame deletion in InlP (inlP ΔLRR5) that disrupts its interaction with afadin are deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in transcytosis. In contrast, afadin deletion in host cells does not rescue the transcytosis defect. These findings suggest that InlP targets cytosolic afadin to specifically promote Listeria monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection. The interaction between InlP and afadin may play a key role in the pathogenesis of placental infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes.
The study characterizes the proteome of Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, using complementary mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 6033 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. The detected proteins were characterized according to their predicted biological function and localization, with half allocated into a wide range of functional categories. A total of 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. The study also found 8/12 proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods, revealing a low correlation with previous microarray signal data. The study provides valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism. The detected proteins include 106 previously uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins, which is the first account of these proteins at the protein level. The study used multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap) tandem mass spectrometry to analyze T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits.
The study investigated the conformational dynamics of the tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) within the regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A (PKA) RIα. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the researchers analyzed the two-domain construct RIα (91–379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms. The results support a "double conformational selection" model for the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA RIα. In the absence of cAMP, the PKA-RIα region spanning the two CBDs samples four states, populating a nearly degenerate free-energy landscape, where each CBD accesses both C-binding competent and cAMP-binding incompetent conformations with comparable populations. The binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, selectively stabilizing the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection but is indispensable for full activation of PKA, as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. The two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, suggesting that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics. The study highlights the importance of CBD-B dynamics in modulating the control exerted by CBD-A and provides insights into the cAMP-dependent activation mechanism of PKA RIα.
The study investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in regulating mitochondrial function in macrophages following vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. ISG15 is a protein induced by interferon and plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity. The researchers compared the proteomes of ISG15-deficient (ISG15-/-) and ISG15-sufficient (ISG15+/+) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after VACV infection. The results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were altered in ISG15-/- BMDM treated with interferon (IFN). Specifically, mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in ISG15+/+ BMDM than in ISG15-/- BMDM following IFN treatment. The study also found that ISG15 depletion led to a significant change in macrophage polarization, with ISG15-/- macrophages showing a pro-inflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, but with a blockade of nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation. In contrast, ISG15+/+ macrophages showed higher NO release and a decrease in viral titer following IFN treatment. The results suggest that ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy, and plays a critical role in antiviral immunity. The study highlights the importance of ISG15 in regulating mitochondrial function and macrophage polarization in response to viral infection.
The HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) plays a crucial role in the replication of the virus by degrading its cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. Vpu binds CD4 and recruits the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52GXXS56 motif. However, Vpu escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP natural targets such as β-catenin and IκBα. A novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, was identified as the triggering event for Vpu degradation by a βTrCP-independent process. This phosphorylation event occurs especially in cells arrested in early mitosis. Mutation of Vpu S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and significantly increases the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant of regulated Vpu turnover is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates, suggesting a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. The results highlight a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or as a substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant, despite its negative effect on virion release, implies a selective advantage for the virus. The study provides new insights into the regulation of Vpu and its role in HIV-1 replication.
The coordination of tissue patterning with whole-body development is crucial for generating robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations during development. To investigate this coordination, researchers developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae based on the expression of canonical patterning genes. This scheme was linked to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation. The study found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these events represent developmental milestones. In contrast, the progression of pattern between these milestones showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Specifically, discs from wandering larvae exhibited greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering does not act as a developmental milestone for wing disc patterning. Furthermore, the study revealed that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. The findings provide new insights into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole and highlight the importance of developmental milestones in ensuring the robustness of the adult phenotype. Overall, the study demonstrates that the progression of pattern in the wing disc is more plastic than previously thought, and that developmental milestones play a critical role in coordinating tissue patterning with whole-body development.
The ESCRT regulator Did2 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between long-distance endosomal transport and endocytic trafficking in highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae. Early endosomes in these cells function in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the crosstalk between these trafficking processes is not well understood. This study demonstrates that Did2 coordinates endosomal transport in Ustilago maydis fungal hyphae by regulating endosomal maturation and membrane identity. Loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, reduced processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, explaining the disturbed processive movement. Furthermore, the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The study reveals that Did2 is essential for the precise maturation of endosomes and provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. The findings highlight the importance of the ESCRT regulator Did2 in maintaining the balance between endocytic trafficking and long-distance transport in highly polarized cells.
A comparative study of adenine riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus has revealed distinct differences in their regulatory mechanisms. While both riboswitches bind adenine, they control gene expression at different levels: transcriptionally in B. subtilis and translationally in V. vulnificus. The study found that the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, whereas the V. vulnificus add riboswitch can bind adenine post-transcriptionally and still regulate translation. The rate of transcription is critical for the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch to perform efficiently, suggesting a co-transcriptional regulation mechanism. In contrast, the V. vulnificus add riboswitch operates under a thermodynamic model, where ligand binding and regulation can occur post-transcriptionally without the need for transcription-translation coupling. The study also demonstrated that the V. vulnificus add riboswitch can regulate translation even when transcription and translation are uncoupled, and that the riboswitch conformations are responsible for adenine-dependent modulation of translation. Overall, the results suggest that the nature of gene regulation control, whether transcriptional or translational, plays a crucial role in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms.
The study reveals a conserved pattern of primer-dependent transcription initiation (PDI) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vibrio cholerae, a pathogenic bacterium. PDI involves the use of a 2- to 4-nt oligoribonucleotide primer to initiate transcription, which has been shown to be prevalent at promoters of genes expressed during the stationary phase of growth in E. coli. The study establishes a physiological role for PDI in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation. Using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5' RNA-seq), the study demonstrates that PDI occurs in V. cholerae and reveals a striking similarity in the pattern of PDI between the two organisms. PDI is detected in stationary phase, not in exponential phase, and is preferentially apparent at promoters carrying the sequence T-1A+1 or G-1G+1. The study proposes that PDI in both E. coli and V. cholerae occurs through a growth phase-dependent process that leads to the preferential generation of the linear dinucleotides 5'-UA-3' and 5'-GG-3'. The findings suggest that PDI may be widespread among Gammaproteobacteria and propose a model in which the extent of PDI relative to de novo initiation fluctuates as a function of growth state.
This study investigated the effect of parental genome dosage imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis. In mammals and plants, parental genome dosage imbalance has been shown to deregulate embryo growth and may contribute to reproductive isolation between emerging new species. Imprinted genes, which are expressed by a single parental allele, have been proposed to play a key role in this process. The parental conflict theory suggests that parental genome imbalances are directly mirrored by antagonistic regulations of imprinted genes encoding maternal growth inhibitors and paternal growth enhancers. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. This study examined the expression of four imprinted genes in Arabidopsis: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA), MEDEA (MEA), and PHERES1 (PHE1). The results showed that genome dosage imbalance deregulated the expression of FIS2 and PHE1 in an antagonistic manner. Increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and MEA. The changes in PHE1 and MEA expression could not be fully accounted for by the corresponding fluctuations of FIS2 expression. These findings suggest that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms independent of known regulators of imprinting. The complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance does not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis.
Biomedical research has made significant progress in understanding the biophysical mechanisms underlying brain rhythms and neuronal synchronization. However, the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. This study investigates the functional aspects of oscillatory brain dynamics by reverse-engineering network architectures that generate characteristic brain rhythms. The researchers used mathematical techniques to construct abstract networks, or “virtual brains”, whose dynamics are similar to EEG and MEG recordings. These virtual brains display similar topological features and dynamics as actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves. The study also reconstructed putative diseased brains, such as those with epilepsy and schizophrenia, and found consistent alterations in functional connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, as quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with diseased brains displaying lower complexity than normal brains. The results suggest that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys significant information about the functional connectivity of the brain. The study provides new insights into the neurobiology of health and disease, and has implications for understanding the functional role of brain rhythms.
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) provides a comprehensive analysis of the population structure of Hispanics in the United States. A total of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America were included in the study. Using 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium, the researchers performed population structure analysis and identified four distinct subgroups of the MESA Hispanic cohort. These subgroups correspond to primarily Central/South America, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, showing close agreement with self-identification. The analysis also revealed that the first two principal components (PCs) of ancestry quantify Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth PCs bring out an axis that aligns with the known South-to-North geographic location of Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) Native American samples. To demonstrate the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies, the researchers performed pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanic populations. The results show statistically significant evidence for genetic association in both genes, highlighting the need for careful consideration of population substructure in genetic analysis of Hispanic cohorts.
The Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetyltransferase, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and plays a crucial role in transcriptional silencing and genome stability. Deletion of Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, results in partial loss of silencing of reporter genes at the chromosome VIIL telomere and the HMR locus, and increased sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Mutations in Elp3 that compromise the formation of the Elongator complex also lead to loss of silencing and increased HU sensitivity. Furthermore, Elp3 is required for S-phase progression in the presence of HU. Epistasis analysis reveals that the elp3Δ mutant exacerbates the MMS sensitivity of cells lacking histone chaperones Asf1, CAF-1, and the H3 lysine 56 acetyltransferase Rtt109. PCNA binds to the Elongator complex both in vivo and in vitro, indicating a novel role for the intact Elongator complex in transcriptional silencing and genome stability linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA. The results suggest that the Elongator complex functions in multiple cellular processes, including DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, and that its interaction with PCNA is essential for maintaining genome stability.
A machine-learning assisted triage method has been proposed to improve the efficiency of biomedical literature curation in genomic variation resources. The method uses deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and rank new publications for curation. The models were trained on previously curated publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, which served as a gold-standard dataset. The trained models were then applied to the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. The results showed that the machine-assisted triage method outperformed the current query-based triage methods, achieving a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The method also retrieved many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. The study demonstrated that the machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient and is being implemented in production, allowing human curators to focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases. The method was evaluated on three different datasets, including UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the GWAS Catalog, and mycoSet, and achieved high performance on all datasets.
Atrial arrhythmogenicity of KCNJ2 mutations in short QT syndrome was investigated using biophysically-detailed human atria computer models. Gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ2-encoded Kir2. 1 channels underlie variant 3 ( SQT3 ) of the short QT syndrome, which is associated with atrial fibrillation ( AF ). A contemporary model of the human atrial action potential ( AP ) was modified to recapitulate functional changes in IK1 due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172N and E299V Kir2. 1 mutations. The effects of mutations on AP duration ( APD ), conduction velocity ( CV ), effective refractory period ( ERP ), tissue excitation threshold and their rate-dependence, as well as the wavelength of re-entry ( WL ) were quantified. The D172N and E299V Kir2. 1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK1 and APD shortening. Both mutations decreased WL for re-entry through a reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of re-entrant excitation waves in 2D and 3D tissue models was mediated by changes to tissue excitability and dispersion of APD in mutation conditions. Combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, whereas IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Combined inhibition of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. This study provides mechanistic insights into atrial proarrhythmia with SQT3 Kir2. 1 mutations and highlights possible pharmacological strategies for management of SQT3-linked AF.
Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) were investigated for their potential to alter the course of Chagas disease, a complex disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection and tracked by bioluminescence, showing that they remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 days post-infection. Analyses of cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals. In contrast, splenocytes exposed to the same antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response in both placebo and ASC-treated groups, but splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 days post-infection, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice. The results suggest that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, promoting the control of parasite burden and protecting the heart from damage.
The study investigated the efficacy of structurally optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, in limiting Leishmania infections. The analogs, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, were previously reported to have superior potency in inhibiting retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena. The results showed that these analogs were more effective than the parent compound, Retro-2cycl, in controlling Leishmania infections in macrophages, with EC50 values of 13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57+/-2.66μM, respectively, compared to 40.15μM for Retro-2cycl. Additionally, the analogs caused a reversal in Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Furthermore, unlike Retro-2cycl, which is Leishmania-static, the analogs can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures. This is a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections. The study validates and extends the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl. The results suggest that the essential retrograde trafficking pathway is more sensitive in Leishmania, and the analogs are more efficacious than Retro-2cycl in suppressing Leishmania infections. These findings have implications for the development of new treatments for Leishmaniasis.
Title: Nucleosome Presence at AML-1 Binding Sites Inversely Correlates with Ly49 Expression: Revelations from an Informatics Analysis of Nucleosomes and Immune Cell Transcription Factors

    A computational method was developed to evaluate the nucleosome sensitivity of transcription factors over a given stretch of the genome. Using this method, the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor was identified as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the mouse Ly49 gene family. AML-1a is a regulator of immune gene expression, and its binding sites were found to be preferentially depleted of nucleosomes in expressed Ly49 genes compared to silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes.

    A whole-chromosome analysis of nucleosome-transcription factor interactions revealed that many other transcription factors display nucleosome coverage and lack of 10 bp periodicity, indicating potential nucleosome sensitivity. This was confirmed in a cell line where expressed Ly49 genes showed preferential nucleosome depletion specifically at AML-1a binding sites compared to inactive Ly49 genes. The study also found that AML-1a sites are preferentially depleted of nucleosomes throughout the promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly49 genes when compared to unexpressed genes within the same population, implicating nucleosome positioning as a possible mechanism to affect Ly49 expression in vivo. These findings suggest that nucleosome sensitivity is a selected trait for Ly49 regulation and propose that this method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general.
The study investigated the role of CDK7 in the activation of CDK4 and CDK2, two key regulators of the cell cycle. CDK7 is a cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) that phosphorylates the T-loop of CDK2 and CDK1, but its role in CDK4 activation was unclear. The researchers used a chemical-genetics approach to inhibit CDK7 in HCT116 cells and found that CDK7 inhibition prevented the activating phosphorylation of CDK4 and CDK6. However, this effect was partly dependent on the binding of p21cip1 to CDK4. The study also identified a novel CDK7-dependent positive feedback loop mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2, which sustains CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage. The results suggest that CDK7 plays a crucial but indirect role in the activation of CDK4 and CDK6, and that there are CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7. Furthermore, the study found that CDK4 and CDK6 can phosphorylate p21, which is complexed with D-type cyclins and CDK4, and that this phosphorylation is inhibited by CDK7 inhibition. The study provides new insights into the regulation of CDK4 and CDK6 and highlights the importance of CDK7 in cell cycle progression.
The chromatin protein DUET/MMD1 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the meiotic gene TDM1 during male meiosis in Arabidopsis. DUET/MMD1 is a PHD finger protein essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis and functions as a transcriptional regulator. The protein binds to H3K4me2 in vitro and this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. DUET/MMD1 is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II, independently of its function in meiosis I. The protein shows stage-specific expression, confined to the diplotene stage of prophase I. Two genes, TDM1 and JAS, which are critical for cell cycle transitions and spindle organization in male meiosis, are identified as targets of DUET/MMD1, with TDM1 being a direct target. Expression profiling revealed reduced expression of a subset of meiosis-preferred genes in the duet mutant. The results suggest that DUET/MMD1 regulates microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis and functions as a direct transcriptional activator of the meiotic gene TDM1. The study reveals the action of DUET/MMD1 as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in plants and suggests that transcription of meiotic genes is under stage-wise control in plants, similar to yeast. The findings also suggest a developmental function for H3K4me2 in Arabidopsis male reproduction.
Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. Previous studies have shown that rCGG repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that proteins such as Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate rCGG-mediated neuronal toxicity. To further explore the role of Pur α in rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration, researchers identified over 100 proteins that interact with Pur α, including Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase. Rm62 physically interacts with Pur α and can modulate rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration. Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 posttranscriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This accumulation is likely due to impaired nuclear export of these mRNAs. The researchers found that the expression of fragile X premutation rCGG repeats significantly reduced the viability of heterozygous Rm62 mutant flies, indicating a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death. The study suggests that the nuclear accumulation of select mRNAs caused by fragile X premutation rCGG repeats may contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis, potentially through impaired nuclear export due to decreased levels of Rm62. This could interfere with the neurons' ability to produce sufficient proteins to respond to cellular stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms, has been studied to understand the development of its extracellular matrix. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of P. aeruginosa biofilms is a complex mixture of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. The Psl exopolysaccharide, encoded by the polysaccharide synthesis locus (PA2231-2245), is a key component of the EPS and plays a crucial role in biofilm formation. During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and the assembly of a matrix that holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. Chemical dissociation of Psl from the bacterial surface disrupts the Psl matrix and the biofilm structure. During biofilm maturation, Psl accumulates on the periphery of 3-D-structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl matrix-free cavity in the microcolony center. At the dispersion stage, swimming cells appear in this matrix cavity, and dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated in the Psl matrix-free area. Deletion of genes that control cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion. These findings provide a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal. The study highlights the importance of Psl as a key scaffolding matrix component and opens up avenues for therapeutics of biofilm-related complications.
This study aimed to investigate the concordance between primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumours, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and patient-derived organoids (PDO) at the whole-genome level. The researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. A pipeline was developed to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. The results showed that tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlighted previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. However, polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes, and ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. The study highlights that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity. The findings suggest that PDXs and PDOs can recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations mainly in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent to identify novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The study analyzed 690,947 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, followed by replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls, and further evaluation in 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls. The top 22 SNPs were then investigated in an additional 7,489 cases and 9,934 controls. The study identified a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by SNP rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1. This SNP showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared to the G/G genotype. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively, also showed a consistent association in each of the four stages. These findings provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus and identify two possible susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East-Asian women.
A study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) isolates from HIV-positive South African patients with cryptococcal meningitis revealed high levels of genetic diversity and locus variability compared to globally distributed types. The isolates were grouped into 50 sequence types within the main molecular types VNI, VNII, and VNB, with 72% of isolates typed into one of seven 'high frequency' sequence types. Spatial analysis of patients' cryptococcal genotype did not show geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent local acquisition. The study found a relationship between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having significantly worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003). This association was maintained even after adjustment for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen. Comparison of fungal genotype with in vitro phenotype revealed evidence of lineage-associated virulence phenotype, with the VNII lineage displaying increased laccase activity (p=0.001) and ex vivo CSF survival (p=0.0001). The findings suggest that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that lineage plays an important role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. The study highlights the need for a detailed understanding of the genetic diversity in Southern Africa to assess the risks different ecotypes pose to infection.
The evolution of new signal transduction pathways in organisms remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of examples of newly evolved pathways. In Candida albicans, a human fungal pathogen, researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype. This discovery provides a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans, offering insights into the evolution of new signal transduction pathways. The pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans: the upstream portion from the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process, Tec1 from a filamentation pathway, and the white-specific downstream target genes from an ancestral biofilm process. The evolution of this pheromone response pathway in C. albicans may serve as a paradigm for how new signal transduction pathways evolve. The white cell pheromone response pathway is unique in that it has had insufficient time to duplicate, replace, or modify components in response to new selective pressures or changing roles, providing a glimpse into the evolution of a new signal transduction pathway.
The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies significantly across different species, ranging from less than 20% to more than 70%. This variation has been attributed to differences in the pattern of mutation between bacteria. To test this hypothesis, the authors examined patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera. They found a large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species. This excess of GC→AT mutations is inconsistent with mutation bias, as it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. Additionally, the patterns are unlikely due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. Therefore, the authors conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, they further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria. The results suggest that GC-rich bacteria have a genuine excess of GC→AT mutations, while the excess of AT→GC mutations in AT-rich species may be due to a violation of the infinite sites assumption.
The study presents a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in Kenya using Bayesian space-time geostatistical models. The models were developed using data from 945 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009, which included 106,370 individuals. The models were used to interpolate the probability that infection prevalence exceeded the 20% threshold across the country for both 1989 and 2009. The results show that in most areas for 2009, there was high certainty that endemicity was below the 20% threshold, with areas of endemicity ≥20% located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. Comparison of the predicted distributions for 1989 and 2009 indicates a gradual decrease in observed STH prevalence over time. The model estimated that a total of 2.8 million school-age children live in districts that warrant mass treatment. The study suggests that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and warrant mass treatment. Bayesian space-time geostatistical models can be used to reliably estimate the combined observed prevalence of STH and inform decision-making in helminth control. The results of this study can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control as control efforts are successful in reducing infection levels.
Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells play a crucial role in the innate immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Research has shown that iNKT cells can recognize Mtb-infected macrophages, produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and suppress bacterial replication. This innate control of bacterial replication is dependent on CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, which require CD1d expression by infected macrophages as well as IL-12 and IL-18 for activation. In vitro studies demonstrated that iNKT cells, even in limiting quantities, are sufficient to restrict Mtb replication. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of primary splenic iNKT cells from uninfected mice significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent Mtb by the aerosol route. This suggests that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide. The study provides the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. The results indicate that iNKT cells contribute to host defense against tuberculosis by recognizing Mtb-infected macrophages and producing IFN-γ, which activates macrophages to control bacterial replication. The study highlights the importance of iNKT cells in the innate immune response against Mtb infection.
Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyze the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, stabilizing protein assemblies through intra- or intermolecular ε- (γ-glutamyl) lysil cross-links. In the case of Bacillus subtilis endospores, a transglutaminase called Tgl is responsible for cross-linking proteins in the spore coat. Unlike other TGases, Tgl is produced in an active form, raising questions about how its activity is controlled during spore coat assembly. This study investigated the regulation of Tgl activity and found that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern its localization to the surface of the developing spore. The glutamyl (Q) and lysil (K) substrate docking sites on Tgl are crucial for its localization, with residues on the Q side being more important for assembly than those on the K side. The interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate is the determinant step in Tgl localization. Tgl becomes part of the cross-linked products during the reaction, suggesting that it exerts a "spotwelding" activity, cross-linking pre-formed assemblies. The study suggests that the dependency of Tgl on its substrates is used to accurately control the time, location, and extent of its activity, ensuring the covalent fortification of pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore. This mechanism may also control the activity of Tgl orthologues in other spore-forming bacteria.
A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champasack province, southern Lao PDR, to investigate the spatial distribution of Opisthorchis viverrini infection and identify underlying risk factors. The survey collected data on demography, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior, which were combined with remotely sensed environmental data and fed into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and investigate the spatial pattern of O. viverrini infection. The prevalence of O. viverrini among 3,371 study participants with complete data records was 61.1%. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (rice farmer, fisherman, and animal breeder), and unsafe drinking water source as risk factors for infection. History of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors, with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. The study presents the first risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which is essential for spatial targeting of control efforts. The findings suggest that infection with O. viverrini is strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior, and culture, while high transmission is sustained by the lack of sanitation.
In Dar es Salaam, the capital city of the United Republic of Tanzania, the presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae in drains poses a significant risk for the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. A study analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 to determine the importance of drains as larval habitats. The results show that over 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are human-made, with drains being the most common type, accounting for 42% of all aquatic habitats. Drains with stagnant water were found to have a significantly higher presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae compared to those with flowing water, with odds ratios of 8.8 and 6.3, respectively. The study also found a positive association between vegetation and the presence of mosquito larvae. Spatial analysis revealed that the proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae was spatially correlated. The findings suggest that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate over 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats that are currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP. The study highlights the importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts for these diseases.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection up-regulates the activity of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, through the impairment of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. In DENV-infected cells, HMGCR activity is significantly higher, leading to increased cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is necessary for the formation and maintenance of DENV replicative complexes. The inactivation of AMPK by DENV infection is responsible for the enhanced activity of HMGCR, as AMPK activation by metformin reduces HMGCR activity. The co-localization of HMGCR with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E suggests a role for HMGCR in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. Metformin and lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, alter this co-localization and replicative complexes formation, indicating that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. Furthermore, metformin exhibits a dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, augments viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. The results suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replication and identify new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.
The article explores the connection between the kinetics and energy landscape of tRNA translocation on the ribosome using an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome. The study aims to establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape of the process. By analyzing the dynamics of an explicit-solvent simulation of an intact ribosome, the authors identified collective reaction coordinates that capture essential motions during substrate translocation, including 30S-body rotation, 30S-head swivel, and tRNA displacements. These motions are critical for protein elongation in the cell. The diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates were used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape, providing an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. The analysis suggests that the process of tRNA translocation can be decomposed into a superposition of slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations, with many residues undergoing coordinated displacements reminiscent of rigid body movement. The study provides a unifying framework for understanding and interpreting all available data for tRNA translocation in the ribosome, establishing a connection between kinetic and energetic descriptions of the process. This framework is general and can be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states. The findings contribute to our understanding of the ribosome's function as a "thermal ratchet machine," where random energetic fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive configurational rearrangements.
The genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) has been explored through the analysis of 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. The study identified 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes, with the most common mutation occurring in the ret proto-oncogene in 47 cases. Other frequently mutated genes included Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine kinase 11, v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, and MET proto-oncogene. The study also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), identifying two cases positive for ALK FISH. Customized targeted cancer panel sequencing revealed ALK fusions with glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1) and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4). The EML4-ALK fusion was found in a metastatic MTC case that showed a dramatic response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. The study suggests that the EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target for ALK inhibitors. Additionally, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a candidate for molecular target therapy. The findings provide new insights into the genetic landscape of MTC and highlight the potential for targeted therapies in this rare malignancy.
In a study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India, a high prevalence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis was found in a population of 2,603 individuals, with 3.16% (79/2,497) testing positive for antileishmanial antibodies. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1. Among the asymptomatic cases, 10.39% (8/77) progressed to symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) over a three-year follow-up period, while 80.52% (62/77) showed sero-conversion. Seven individuals (9.09%) remained seropositive after three years. The study highlights the importance of asymptomatic cases in driving the epidemic and the need for attention in the VL elimination program initiated by three adjoining endemic countries. The findings suggest that asymptomatic individuals can remain seropositive for up to three years and may progress to symptomatic disease at any time during this period. The study also emphasizes that the absence of VL/PKDL cases for two or more years does not necessarily indicate that an area is free from leishmaniasis, as asymptomatic cases can remain undetected and potentially lead to future outbreaks. The results underscore the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of asymptomatic cases to achieve the goal of VL elimination.
The study describes the use of Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genome rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by the introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912. The results show that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 is nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations are mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes. These hotspots are composed of Ty elements and are located on the right arm of chromosome III, the right arm of chromosome V, the left arm of chromosome XIV, and the right arm of chromosome X. The study also found that the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations result from RAD52-dependent recombination, but a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements were also observed. Furthermore, the study found that defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) result in increased accumulation of genome rearrangements and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy. The results suggest that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of genome rearrangements and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote genome rearrangements and aneuploidy. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of genome rearrangements and aneuploidy in S. cerevisiae.
A new docking method called Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation (SDU) has been developed to predict the association of two proteins by minimizing a free energy funnel in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3)) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains. The method employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling. However, the direct application of SDU in the space SE(3) of rotations and translations fails to yield useful underestimators due to the geometry of that space. To address this issue, a strategy is introduced that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance of the two proteins, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules. This approach vastly improves the efficiency of the search by transforming the five-dimensional space into a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation. The SDU algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions. Results for standard protein docking benchmarks demonstrate that the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The successful application of SDU to protein-protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state.
