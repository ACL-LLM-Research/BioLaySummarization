The Notch signaling pathway, previously known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors in Caenorhabditis elegans, has been found to promote reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells. This unexpected role of Notch signaling was discovered through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes. The study reveals that Notch signaling activates specific genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), and identifies the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial Notch target facilitating reprogramming. The findings suggest that Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells. This novel role of Notch signaling has implications for our understanding of development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling. In the C. elegans germline, GLP-1/Notch signaling is essential for maintaining a pool of undifferentiated stem cells/progenitors. However, this study shows that increased GLP-1/Notch signaling promotes cell fate reprogramming by activating genes that are normally silenced by PRC2. The X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggests an antagonistic relationship between GLP-1/Notch and PRC2. The C. elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6, and levels of the corresponding transcripts were not altered by GLP-1/Notch signaling. The study identifies genes regulated by GLP-1/Notch, including genes that maintain germline stem/progenitor cells, and shows that many genes activated by GLP-1/Notch signaling are also repressed by PRC2. The findings demonstrate an antagonistic effect of GLP-1/Notch and PRC2 on germ cell-fate decisions and co-regulation of their common target, UTX-1. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprogramming in intact organisms and has implications for our understanding of development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.
The study investigated the role of the adaptor protein SKAP2 in host defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infection. K. pneumoniae is a pathogen that causes respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder infections. The research found that SKAP2 is essential for protection against K. pneumoniae pulmonary infections in mice. Mice lacking SKAP2 (Skap2-/-) had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice. The bacterial burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes. Neutrophils from Skap2-/- mice were present in infected lungs and degranulated normally in response to K. pneumoniae infection. However, K. pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro was abolished in Skap2-/- neutrophils. The study also found that K. pneumoniae-induced ROS response required the activity of several proteins, including Src family kinases (SFKs), Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, suggesting that SKAP2 is proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. The study concluded that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection. The results suggest that SKAP2 plays a critical role in host defense against K. pneumoniae infection and that ROS production is an important mechanism for protection against this pathogen. The study also found that K. pneumoniae is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression, but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection. Mice lacking the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase (Cybb-/-) were significantly more susceptible to K. pneumoniae infection, further supporting the importance of ROS in host defense against this pathogen.
A mathematical model of Plasmodium vivax transmission has been developed to investigate the contribution of the hypnozoite reservoir to the parasite's life cycle. The hypnozoite reservoir refers to the latent liver-stage parasites that can reactivate weeks to months after the initial infection, causing new blood-stage infections. A within-host model of liver-stage hypnozoites was created and validated against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The model demonstrated that the hypnozoite reservoir is over-dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites were predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission.

The model was then embedded in a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The results showed that incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens could cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission. This is because individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

Relapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P. vivax. The hypnozoite reservoir constitutes a third malaria parasite reservoir, in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito present for P. falciparum. Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection or as up to two broods of hypnozoites.

Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, the blood, and the liver. The within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes demonstrated that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model was integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria.
This study investigates the dynamics of carbon (C) recovery in Amazonian forests following selective logging, a common human disturbance in tropical forests. Selective logging results in the emission of over 90 Tg of C to the atmosphere each year, which is then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. To understand the regional differences in C recovery, the authors developed an original modeling approach using data from 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha total) across Amazonia. The results show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and the west (21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1), where environmental stress is high due to low rainfall and high seasonality. The study highlights the key role of survivors in forest regrowth and provides a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.

The authors partitioned the contributions to post-disturbance aboveground carbon stock (ACS) gain and loss from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH and mortality of survivors and recruited trees to identify the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia. The study used long-term (8-30 year) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield. The sites met specific criteria, including location in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm, a total censused area above 1 ha, at least one pre-logging census, and at least two post-logging censuses.

The study focused on selective logging, a type of disturbance with significant economic value and implications for forest management. The results provide clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests' response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances. The authors up-scaled their results to Amazonia (sensu lato) using global maps of ACS, climatic conditions, and soil bulk density to elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss, a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia.

The study highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of human activities on carbon cycles, particularly the 2.1 ± 1.1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the dynamics of C recovery in Amazonian forests following selective logging and contribute to the development of predictive maps of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.
The study investigated the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse forebrain, specifically in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle. The researchers used flow cytometry to prospectively identify and isolate NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells, referred to as GEPCOT cells. These cells were found to be highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo, based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher levels of Glast, and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2, and were long-lived in the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted both pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, with pre-GEPCOT cells being more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression. The study distinguishes between quiescent NSCs and NICs, making it possible to study their properties in vivo. GEPCOT cells accounted for 3.2 ± 0.7% of all SVZ cells and were highly enriched for NICs, with 36 ± 6% forming neurospheres and 74% of those undergoing multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers and were long-lived in the SVZ. Fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 showed that GEPCOT cells persisted only transiently in the SVZ, while pre-GEPCOT cells were long-lived. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 depleted both cell populations, with pre-GEPCOT cells being more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a repression.
The study investigated the function of Piezo1 ion channels as mechanotransducers in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature, suggesting that Piezo1 ion channels may interact functionally. The researchers used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. The results showed that Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension, both at endogenous densities (1–2 channels/μm2) and at non-physiological densities (10–100 channels/μm2) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap. This suggests that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. The study proposes that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. Stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions supported the electrophysiological data, showing that Piezo1 ion channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently function as independent mechanotransducers. This result is important because it shows that Piezo1 channels have no strong intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other’s mechanical sensitivity, which is ideal for a cell to transduce mechanical forces homogeneously. The study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of force detection in cells and highlights the importance of Piezo1 channels in sensing mechanical forces.
The study investigated the influence of evidence volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence in a perceptual decision. A novel sensory manipulation was introduced to mimic the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex, which was verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. The results showed that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence in both humans and monkeys over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model.

The study aimed to test the predictions of the bounded evidence accumulation model, which suggests that an increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence. To achieve this, the researchers applied the manipulation to a well-studied motion task, verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque, and showed how the framework based on the bounded accumulation of evidence can account for the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence.

The study demonstrated that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision, termed volatility, increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it. The researchers tested the influence of volatility on the decision process by mimicking a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. They verified that the manipulation has the desired properties by recording from direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of the macaque visual cortex, which are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in the study.

The study used a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task to investigate the relationship between volatility and decision speed. Three human participants completed 6631 trials, and one macaque completed 14,137 trials. The results showed that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence in both humans and monkeys over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model.
The insulin-like signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors in mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but its mechanism of action was previously unknown. This study reveals that TAX-6•CNB-1, the C. elegans Calcineurin ortholog, and UNC-43, the C. elegans Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) ortholog, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization, whereas TAX-6•CNB-1 dephosphorylates and inactivates DAF-16. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. In contrast to insulin signaling, which phosphorylates and inactivates DAF-16, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin. The study demonstrates that CAMKII (UNC-43) and Calcineurin (TAX-6•CNB-1) regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes raises the possibility that they would constitutively negate each other and have no control over DAF-16. However, the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate in conditions where there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16. The study provides new insights into the regulation of lifespan in C. elegans and highlights the complex interplay between multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling, germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction.
A recent study in Drosophila (fruit flies) has shed light on the organizational principles governing the sequential execution of motor programs, specifically in the context of grooming behavior. The researchers used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts, demonstrating that these programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy. This hierarchy dictates that motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy.

    The study found that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series. By controlling each cleaning motor program through genetic targeting, the researchers were able to demonstrate that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy. An empirically derived computational model was also developed to show how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs.

    The findings suggest that the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence. This is in contrast to activation chain and parallel models, which describe different mechanisms for generating sequential behavior. The study highlights the importance of understanding the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and how these circuitries interact to reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism.

    The research provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences. The study's findings have implications for understanding the neural control of serial action selection in other animals, including humans. By identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the serial organization of behavior is encoded in the nervous system.

    The study's use of genetically targeted activation of neural subsets allowed for experimental control over each cleaning motor program, enabling the demonstration of the suppression hierarchy. This approach has invigorated interest in identifying the neurons that drive behavior and has enabled experiments to probe the organization of serial behavior through specific control of individual motor actions.
The protein Shugoshin-like 2 (Sgol2) plays a crucial role in coordinating essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. Sgol2 is involved in protecting cohesin, silencing the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), while its ability to silence the SAC is mediated by direct binding to the MCC protein Mad2. In contrast, Sgol2's effects on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation are independent of PP2A and are mediated by the recruitment of the kinesin MCAK and the inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.

Depletion of Sgol2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis I, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2's other two partners, Cdc20 and Mad1. Sgol2 also delays bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, causes increased bivalent stretching, and increases Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores, which is accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Furthermore, Sgol2 deficiency delays APC/CCdc20 activation, suggesting that it is required to shut off the SAC.

Interestingly, a single protein, Sgol2, regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and Aurora B/C kinases. Different point mutations in Sgol2 alter the regulation of some but not other processes, indicating that the pleiotropy observed in Sgol2-deficient oocytes is not due to knock-on effects of eliminating a single function. Sgol2's ability to protect centromeric cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, but its deficiency causes striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics, suggesting that Sgol2 has additional functions beyond cohesin protection.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons. Previous studies have shown that local translation plays a crucial role in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. This study investigated whether local stimulation also triggers the directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. The mechanisms that trigger local translation were found to involve calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than directing the delivery of mRNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. The study suggests that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is primarily mediated at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. Netrin-1/DCC signaling was found to play a key role in regulating local translation at synapses and/or stimulated synapses. The release of netrin-1 from either the sensory neuron (SN) or the motor neuron (MN) during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity triggers translation at sites of synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts. Recombinant Fc-netrin-1 was used to test the possibility that netrin-1 regulates the synthesis of localized transcripts in Aplysia sensory-motor neuronal cultures. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the spatial regulation of gene expression in neurons and the role of netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation.
Title: Spatiotemporal mosaic self-patterning of pluripotent stem cells using CRISPR interference

    A novel in vitro system has been developed to investigate cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. The system utilizes CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension, allowing for controlled symmetry-breaking events within hiPSC populations. By creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and inducing mosaic knockdown (KD) of specific genes, researchers were able to observe differential patterning within the colonies due to cellular self-organization.

    The study focused on the effects of induced mosaic KD of molecular regulators of cortical tension (ROCK1) and cell-cell adhesion (CDH1) on hiPSC colonies. Mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within the colonies, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. This patterning was accompanied by a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations, which stabilized in coordination with the observed self-organization.

    The CRISPRi system enabled the genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating a better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis. The study demonstrates a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations and control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells. This approach has the potential to create robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.

    The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of morphogenesis and the role of cell-cell interactions in the formation of complex multicellular patterns and structures. The use of CRISPRi to silence specific genes within subpopulations of cells allows for a high degree of control over the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and the development of multicellular patterns. This approach has significant implications for the study of human developmental biology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
A resource-rational theory of set size effects in human visual working memory proposes that the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost to explain why encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. The theory suggests that the brain trades off expected task performance against the cost of spending neural resources on encoding. This normative theory was tested on data from nine delayed-estimation experiments and found to account well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision. The model also predicts that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size, which is supported by the data. Furthermore, the theory suggests that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. This raises the possibility that cognitive "limitations" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints. The theory may apply beyond working memory tasks, potentially explaining set size effects in attention tasks as well. It provides a normative formalism to test the speculation that the selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against the costs associated with spiking. The model has relatively few parameters and accounts for a non-monotonicity between set size and the total amount of resource that subjects invest in item encoding. At the neural level, this translates to a prediction of a non-monotonic relation between population-level spiking activity and set size, which can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. The theory also makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision, as such manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function.
The Irish potato famine pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, has evolved an effector protein called PexRD54 that antagonizes a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses. Autophagy is a cellular process used by plants to safeguard against infectious diseases, but how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes was previously unknown. PexRD54 binds to the host autophagy protein ATG8CL, stimulating the formation of autophagosomes and depleting the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes. This interaction allows PexRD54 to interfere with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense, promoting disease susceptibility.

    PexRD54 has an ATG8 interacting motif that enables it to bind to ATG8CL with high affinity, unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, which activates autophagy to eliminate defense-related compounds or reattribute cellular resources. The RXLR effector family, to which PexRD54 belongs, is a diverse group of modular proteins that alter various host processes and serve as useful probes to dissect key pathways for pathogen invasion.

    The study reveals that, in addition to disrupting autophagy, pathogens can also activate it for their own benefit. PexRD54 competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. The effector's ability to outcompete Joka2 and deplete it from ATG8CL autophagosomes suggests that PexRD54 has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.

    The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process. The study highlights the importance of understanding how adapted plant pathogens manipulate defense-related autophagy and/or subvert autophagy for nutrient uptake. Future studies will need to consider pathogen-directed modulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection.

    The discovery of PexRD54's ability to bind to ATG8CL and deplete Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes suggests that other plant pathogens may also secrete effectors that evolved an ATG8 interacting motif or target autophagy in other ways. These effectors could serve as valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy.
The study investigated the adaptive responses of human cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to controlled mechanical strain and oxygen changes in vitro. Cardiac fibroblasts play a crucial role in tissue adaptation and inflammation during pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, a comprehensive understanding of how early environmental changes induce CF pathological responses is lacking due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation. To address this knowledge gap, the authors developed a multi-stimulus microdevice that applies cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary CFs. The results show that individual stimuli cause distinct responses in CFs, including proliferative effects such as increased mitotic cells, YAP translocation, and PDGF secretion, as well as increased collagen presence. Notably, the combination of hypoxia and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) triggers the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. This synergistic effect was not observed with individual stimuli. The study highlights the importance of considering the combination of environmental stimuli in understanding CF pathological responses and provides insights into emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms. The findings have implications for future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the development of in vitro models for cardiac disease. The authors propose an innovative model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury, providing a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies. The study contributes to the development of in vitro models of cardiac disease, which have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation, including mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines. By finely controlling the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes, the authors provide insights into the individual or synergistic contributions of environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. The results suggest that mimicking the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility is crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs, while individual environmental stimuli only regulate proliferative and collagen-related responses.
Drosophila SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms. The DOMINO complex is a chromatin regulator that combines histone acetylation and deposition of H2A. Z variant in Drosophila. Two alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation, but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A. V genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. This work provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene. The two DOM isoforms, DOM-A and DOM-B, have distinct structures and functions. DOM-A has a long ATPase domain and is thought to be the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila. The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the yeast NuA4 complex has not been reported before. The ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A complex. This work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators. H2A. Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to be important for regulating transcription initiation and early elongation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2A. Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex, a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A. V genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. The functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription were explored by RNAseq. Knock-downs of DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60, and H2A. V were included in the analysis. The results suggest that the two DOM isoforms have distinct roles in transcriptional regulation.
The formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) between motoneurons and muscle cells is a complex process that requires precise interactions between the two cell types. A key player in this process is β-catenin (Ctnnb1) in muscle cells, which has been shown to be critical for motoneuron differentiation. However, the nature of the retrograde signal from muscle cells to motoneurons that directs presynaptic differentiation remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers used an in vivo transgenic approach to investigate the functions of muscle Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. They found that the transcriptional activity of muscle Ctnnb1 is essential for presynaptic differentiation, as a Ctnnb1 mutant lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits in mice with a Ctnnb1 mutation. In contrast, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 was found to be dispensable. This suggests that muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins.

    The researchers then screened for proteins that may serve as Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factors and identified Slit2 as a potential candidate. They found that transgenic expression of Slit2 in muscle cells was able to diminish presynaptic deficits in mice with a Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density and active zone, and depressed miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs). Furthermore, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. These observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. The researchers also showed that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene, and that Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1. Slit2 was found to be concentrated at the NMJ, further supporting its role in presynaptic differentiation. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ formation and highlight the importance of Slit2 as a retrograde signal from muscle cells to motoneurons.
Title: Mapping the Dynamics of Force Transduction at Cell–Cell Junctions of Epithelial Clusters

    A recent study has elucidated the dynamics of force transduction at cell–cell junctions in epithelial clusters using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. The research aimed to quantify the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution. The study focused on spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell–cell junctions.

    Using a generalized cell–cell force measurement and analysis method, the researchers quantified the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters. Time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell–cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time, both during interphase and cell divisions. The study investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of molecular components of cell–cell junctions, focusing on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells.

    The results showed that local mechanical stresses along the cell junction correlated with the localization of E-cadherin molecules. Expanding the approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell, the researchers found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction. The method also provided insights into tissue mechanics by revealing that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter, due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell–matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility.

    The study demonstrated that force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. The findings provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues and highlight the developed methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell–cell adhesions.
Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. To understand the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion, researchers conducted various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry. The results indicate that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure, with the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions forming a circumscribed central cavity. The polyglutamine expansion was found to increase the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affect intramolecular interactions among the domains. These findings provide insight into the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin and how the polyglutamine expansion affects its structure and function. The researchers propose that the spherical solenoid structure of huntingtin enables the modulation of its structure and function by the polyglutamine tract, which may explain how the disease-causing expansion of the polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin. The study used a panel of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts to investigate the impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin’s basic structural features. The results suggest that huntingtin may undergo dramatic conformational changes upon interaction with its binding partners. Single-particle electron microscopy of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues revealed a spherical α-helical solenoid structure. The study provides a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may modulate huntingtin structure and function. The findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Huntington’s disease and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Ferritinophagy, the autophagic turnover of ferritin, is a critical process for regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the role of NCOA4, a selective cargo receptor for ferritin, in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. This study reveals the molecular basis of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and elucidates how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting. NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin heavy chain 1 ( FTH1 ) via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. This interaction is essential for the delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system, with ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover promoted by excess iron and involving an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. The HERC2 ligase recognizes NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation, highlighting the importance of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ferritinophagy and the role of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying iron homeostasis in cells.
The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained poorly understood. A long-standing proposal suggests that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. However, empirical support for this theory has been limited. Recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a rostral-caudal gradient of abstraction in the LPFC, indicating that progressively rostral areas of the LPFC process more abstract information. Dynamic causal modeling further revealed asymmetrical interactions among LPFC sub-regions, indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned the mid-LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards the mid-LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Furthermore, the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. These findings collectively suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid-LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior. The hierarchical organization of the LPFC was confirmed by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity and temporal control over action. Modeling interactions among LPFC sub-regions revealed that cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing. Both the hierarchical orientation of the mid-LPFC in fixed connectivity and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid-LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability. The results suggest that top-down control within the LPFC is an important determinant of higher-level cognitive function. Furthermore, more strongly asymmetrical hierarchical projections from mid-LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability, indicating a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization with mid-LPFC at the apex. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in mid-LPFC, and cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid-LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid-LPFC. Analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid-LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action.
The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 has been found to play a crucial role in the generation of basal neural progenitors and the induction of cortical folding in mice. Cortical expansion and folding are thought to be linked to the evolution of higher intelligence, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored until now. The study found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells and promoted the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia, which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of outer radial glia. Localized outer radial glia proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. This suggests that TBC1D3 is required for the generation of outer radial glia in regulating the cortical expansion and folding. The study also found that TBC1D3 expression in neuroprogenitors by in utero electroporation at E13.5 caused a reduced expression of Trnp1 in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15, indicating that TBC1D3 affects intrinsic stemness signaling pathways in basal progenitors. The study provides proof-of-concept that brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution, and that TBC1D3 acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding. The results suggest that TBC1D3-induced outer radial glia generation and cortical folding may be a key mechanism underlying the evolution of higher intelligence in primates.
The study investigated the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1. NPR1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in plants, and its activation is associated with transcriptome reprogramming. Previous research suggested that immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, thereby maximizing gene expression. However, the study aimed to explore whether ubiquitination of NPR1 plays a transcriptional role prior to its proteasomal turnover.

The results showed that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event, initiated by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL3), which promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. Subsequent polyubiquitination of NPR1 by the E4 ligase UBE4 targets it for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity.

The study found that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. Instead, initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term. The study suggests that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover.

Furthermore, the study demonstrated that loss of UBE4 largely uncouples NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity, highlighting the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity. The findings indicate that the sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases, balanced by opposing deubiquitinases, fine-tune the activity of NPR1 without a strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover. This study provides new insights into the complex regulation of NPR1 and its role in plant immune responses.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNAs ) play a crucial role in guiding cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ), and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). However, the precursors of siRNAs have remained largely undefined. This study aimed to identify the precursors of 24 nt siRNAs in Arabidopsis. The researchers found that Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events. The study also found that dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, but individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units. Furthermore, the short double-stranded P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl3 mutants are the immediate precursors of siRNAs, based on the ability of DCL3 to cut these precursors into 24 nt RNAs in vitro. These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and the role of Pol IV and RDR2 in this process.
The development of mature neural networks in the brain is a complex process that enables the precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity necessary for cognition. However, the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains poorly understood. A recent study investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology. The results reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. The study also demonstrates a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. The authors hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. The study found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. After this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged. The results suggest that a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations. This shift is marked by the disappearance of immature activity patterns and the emergence of internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. The study provides new insights into the development of mature neural networks and highlights the importance of a transient quiescent period in the emergence of coordinated cortical networks.
An agent-based model has been developed to investigate the population structuring of multi-copy, antigen-encoding genes in Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite responsible for malaria. The model extends earlier ‘strain theory’ by considering the extensive diversity of var genes, which undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. The model tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts and demonstrates that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes. The degree of antigenic overlap between these repertoires depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity.

The var gene family of P. falciparum encodes P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major surface antigen of the parasite's blood stages that binds to host endothelial cell receptors to allow the parasite to sequester within various host tissues. The model considers the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are multi-copy and recombining. By tracking all possible var repertoires, given a diverse pool of genetic variants, the model explores whether structured parasite populations resulting from the selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct var repertoires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity, can emerge.

Mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains have demonstrated that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping, antigenic repertoires, even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination. The ‘var strain’ model suggests that vector control strategies that reduce transmission will not always drastically reduce var gene diversity, because a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse (highly non-overlapping) var repertoires will remain. The agent-based model developed in this study extends strain theory to address the effect of immune selection acting on multi-copy antigen genes and provides insights into the population structuring of P. falciparum.
The deamidase OspI from the enteric bacterium Shigella flexneri disrupts the interaction between the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 by deamidating a glutamine residue in UBC13 to glutamate (Q100E). This post-translational modification silences the polyubiquitination activity of the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, which is essential for the downstream activation of the NF-κB inflammatory response. The precise mechanism by which deamidation inhibits the UBC13/TRAF6 interaction was investigated, revealing that it perturbs both native and transient interactions between the two proteins. Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6 interface, preventing the formation of a typical UBC13/RING complex. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of TRAF6 prevents transient interactions necessary for complex formation. These findings highlight a novel mechanism by which a post-translational modification can inhibit protein-protein association by disrupting the conformation and stability of transient complexes. Further studies demonstrated that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: the appearance of a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13, salt-bridge competition that perturbs transient complexes, and transient repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING. The Shigella flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response by deamidating UBC13 at Q100, which inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of the NF-κB pathway.
Title: Asymmetric Effects of Activating and Inactivating Cortical Interneurons: A Study in the Auditory Cortex of Awake Mice

    Summary:
    A recent study investigated the effects of activating and inactivating two types of cortical interneurons, somatostatin-positive (Sst+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons, in the auditory cortex of awake mice. Using single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, the researchers found that inactivating Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. In contrast, activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons did not produce such differences. These findings suggest that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex.

    The study used a linear framework to evaluate how interneuron activation suppresses auditory cortical responses. The researchers applied this framework to 59 units from ChR2/Sst mice and 57 units from ChR2/Pvalb mice whose responses were both tuned for frequency and significantly suppressed by activation of interneurons. The results showed that inactivating Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer.

    The study also used a simple network model to understand the asymmetric effects of activating and inactivating interneurons. The model showed that relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons' computational functions.

    The findings of this study challenge the assumption that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid, internally consistent insights into interneurons' computational roles. Instead, the results suggest that the effects of activating and inactivating interneurons can be asymmetric, and that the choice of manipulation can influence the conclusions drawn about interneurons' functions. The study highlights the importance of considering the specific properties of interneurons and the experimental design when using causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function.
Title: Externally induced frontoparietal synchronization modulates network dynamics and enhances working memory performance

Cognitive functions such as working memory (WM) are emergent properties of large-scale network interactions, and synchronization of oscillatory activity is thought to contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. To investigate the role of oscillatory synchronization in WM, researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM.

The study aimed to provide causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance and to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms by which frontoparietal phase synchronization influences verbal WM. Two experiments were conducted using tACS to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms. The researchers tested four hypotheses: (1) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; (2) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase-dependent manner; (3) changes in BOLD induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; and (4) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner.

The results showed that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data revealed tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Functional connectivity results indicated that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Specifically, frontal interactions increased with synchronous theta stimulation, whereas posterior interactions increased with desynchronous stimulation, suggesting that information flow through brain regions involved in WM can be differentially affected by varying the phase of external stimulation.

Overall, the findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization across a right frontoparietal network activated by the task. The study provides direct evidence for the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and shows the neural correlates associated with this process. The results suggest that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI.
The transcription factor Pitx2 has been identified as a key regulator of embryonic axis formation and twinning in amniote embryos. In contrast to invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates, where embryonic polarity is specified by maternal determinants early in development, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. A molecular screen was conducted to identify upstream regulators of cVg1, a transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation in the chick embryo. The screen revealed Pitx2 as a candidate transcription factor that acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and is also involved in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

Pitx2 is a transcription factor that is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and in bisected embryo marginal zone, and is expressed before cVg1. The results implicate Pitx2 as an upstream regulator of cVg1 expression, and suggest that it plays a crucial role in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity. The ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a regulative model of development until a late stage suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity.

The expression of Pitx2 and cVg1 was examined in whole embryos and in isolated anterior halves, and the results show that Pitx2 is expressed before cVg1 and in the same domain. This suggests that Pitx2 acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression, and that it is essential for axis formation. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1, and Nodal are also key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of embryonic axis formation and twinning in amniote embryos, and highlight the importance of Pitx2 as a key regulator of these processes.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, projection neurons ( PNs ) in the antennal lobes play a crucial role in signaling the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. The study investigated how early olfactory circuits process temporal variations of olfactory stimuli by subjecting flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examining the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and PNs. The results showed a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, with the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output, indicating that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism enables animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations. PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn. Recent studies have shown that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time. Building on this advance, the study aimed to investigate how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. By testing first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations, the study constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input. The study demonstrated that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers, allowing an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase. This encoding mechanism is crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes. The study contributes to our understanding of how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems and highlights the importance of acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe for rapid response to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli.
In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein family. This study reveals that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing PcG function. Furthermore, mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, resulting in seed abortion. The authors propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

    The study provides multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis, including the rapid accumulation of auxin in the integuments after fertilization, impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causing defects in seed coat development, ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiating seed coat development without fertilization, and failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlating with failure to export auxin from the endosperm. These findings suggest that seed coat development requires production of auxin in the fertilized central cell/endosperm and most likely the transport of auxin to the ovule integuments in an AGL62-dependent manner. The fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin that is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, since agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm, leading to auxin accumulation and consequently, failure to develop a seed coat. The study proposes a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production in driving both endosperm and seed coat development.
The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP), which plays a crucial role in governing phage activity and host range. Despite its importance, the molecular rules of RBP function remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression) to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP. By creating a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus, the researchers made all single amino acid substitutions at every site (1660 variants) and quantified the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts.

    The study generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown. The results revealed that single amino acid substitutions alone can generate broad functional diversity, highlighting the evolutionary adaptability of the RBP. The researchers discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wildtype T7, demonstrating that even natural phages well adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. Furthermore, the study identified gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts.

    To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, the researchers engineered T7 variants that avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections. The study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range. The results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wildtype phage that could serve as starting points for further engineering of therapeutic phages. The study presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing phage-host interactions.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, have been found to downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. To investigate the neural basis for this strategy, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted on 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls. Participants read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary and then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues, selecting the best match for the written sentence. The results showed prominent reductions in functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions in the amusia group, reflecting the between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task. The study suggests that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and that individuals with amusia may have implicitly learned to neglect pitch due to its unreliability. This down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas that integrate information from perceptual regions. The findings are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions, and that brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amusia. The study provides evidence for a compensatory mechanism in individuals with amusia, where they rely on other dimensions such as duration to process spoken language. The results have implications for understanding the neural basis of speech perception and language processing in individuals with congenital amusia.
The Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2) is a contagious cancer recently discovered in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), a species that already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). In contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. This suggests that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.

    DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo, in contrast to DFT1, which has lost expression of MHC class I. The non-polymorphic, non-classical MHC class I molecule (Saha-UK) expressed by DFT2 cells likely reduces the immunogenicity of these tumour cells. Furthermore, the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils. MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I-negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely.

    The similarity of MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder. The frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further. The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2. Further analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution.
The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Recent optogenetic circuit mapping in mice has revealed a double dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial RSG that process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1 permits this parallel processing.

    The study found that LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. This suggests that parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG.

    The results highlight a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum preferentially control LR neurons, whereas claustrum and anterior cingulate control RS cells. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed.

    Layer 3 of the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) contains two types of principal pyramidal neurons: the low-rheobase (LR) neuron and the regular-spiking (RS) neuron. The distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum. This integration of various types of directional and distance information is often stated as the key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for the development of dementias, including tauopathies such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying the prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models. To investigate the role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy, researchers developed a novel zebrafish model expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor. This biosensor reliably reports the accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections.

The zebrafish larvae were subjected to a novel TBI paradigm, which produced various TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. The researchers found that bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These findings suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI.

Zebrafish larvae have emerged as a potent complement to rodent models of TBI and cellular models of tauopathy. The engineered fish allowed the researchers to reveal post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy. The study introduced two new approaches to test the hypothesis that neuronal excitability and seizure activity after TBI can accelerate the wide dissemination of Tau pathology. The first approach was to engineer a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS.

The researchers found that a substantial burst of neural activity occurs during TBI, and zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI subsequently exhibit a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures. After validating that their method was able to induce TBI upon zebrafish larvae, the researchers next asked whether TBI induces Tau aggregates in their Tau biosensor model. Combining these novel approaches, they found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI. Manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI. The results from their novel in vivo TBI model implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets.
The relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions was investigated in a recent study using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data. The study aimed to identify how the spatial arrangement of functional brain regions and the coupling strength between neural populations influence derived measures of functional connectivity and relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. It was found that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modeling of brain connectivity, and that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. This suggests that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity. The study highlights the importance of disambiguating the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations. To address this issue, significant advances have been made in recent years to tackle the problem of spatial misalignment across individuals. The organization of the human brain into large-scale functional networks has been extensively investigated using rfMRI, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity between distinct brain regions. However, the study found that network matrices estimated from rfMRI data contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organization of functional regions. This implies that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted 'connectivity fingerprints' largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in coupling strength. The findings of this study have important implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data and cognitive traits, and highlight the need for a better understanding of the relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions.
The TBP/TFIID-dependent activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells is a complex process that involves the replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with the TRF3/TBP2 complex to activate muscle-gene expression. However, recent studies have proposed that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, but rather that limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP are required to promote muscle-specific gene expression. To investigate this further, researchers examined the role of TBP2 in adult skeletal muscle regeneration and myogenesis. TBP2 null mice were found to have an intact regeneration potential upon injury, and TBP2 was not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cells or primary mouse MuSCs. Furthermore, TFIID subunits and TBP were downregulated during myoblast differentiation, but reduced amounts of these proteins formed a complex that was detectable on promoters of muscle genes and was essential for their expression. These findings suggest that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. The results also indicate that TBP2 is not required for adult skeletal muscle regeneration or myogenesis, as MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient mice differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type MuSCs. Additionally, the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice by FACS and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line showed that Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes. Overall, these findings provide evidence that the TFIID complex is present in myogenic cells and drives muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation into myotubes, and that TBP is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles.
Title: Targeted Cortical Reorganization Using Optogenetics in Non-Human Primates

    Summary
    This study investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation on large-scale network dynamics in the brains of two macaques. The researchers used a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocorticographic activity across the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked: the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes. The results showed that stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas within minutes. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network, which reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models.

    The study demonstrated a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network. These findings are well-explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity. The researchers also investigated how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within cortical areas, testing whether stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner. The results support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity, suggesting that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity models.

    The large-scale optogenetic interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation. The findings have the potential to inform future neurorehabilitation strategies by providing insights into the mechanisms of large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation.
In a rare case of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S) born without primary visual cortex (V1), researchers investigated the neural consequences of such damage and its impact on visual perception. The study aimed to understand how the brain compensates for the loss of V1 and to inform the development of rehabilitation methods for human patients with similar damage. The results show that despite the absence of V1, monkey S exhibited unremarkable in-group behavior, but was impaired in visual task training. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that visual structures outside of the lesion, including cortical and subcortical areas, were intact and normal in appearance. Visual stimulation under anesthesia with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field moving dots activated the pulvinar. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even in the absence of V1. However, there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.

The study found that the structural connectivity between subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, but the microstructure was intact. This suggests that the residual visual function in monkey S may be supported by an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas, comparable to control monkeys. The researchers also found that the ventricles within the visual cortex were enlarged and fluid-filled, which could have affected the pattern of anesthesia action in monkey S. A connectivity analysis was performed to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT, which showed no significant activation to either checkerboard or moving dots stimuli. However, foci of activation were found in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting sub-threshold activation. A functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT was also mapped out. The study suggests that retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests that either or both could support residual visual abilities.
The innate immune sensor IFI16 plays a crucial role in recognizing foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus were not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to investigate how IFI16 recognizes and responds to foreign dsDNA in the nucleus. The results show that IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish between self and non-self DNA and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.

The study found that nucleosomes, which are the basic units of chromatin, act as barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with its one-dimensional movements. This suggests that chromatinization is a key feature that allows IFI16 to distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus. The researchers used time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays to demonstrate that IFI16 scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters, and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly.

In vivo, this one-dimensional scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens. The study provides a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves the central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways. The results suggest that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the recognition of foreign DNA by the innate immune sensor IFI16 and highlights the importance of chromatinization in distinguishing self from non-self DNA in the nucleus.
A novel proteomics technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP) has been developed for interrogating micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. This technique involves staining specimens with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, followed by soaking in a solution containing a photo-tag, 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging and two-photon excitation are used to covalently couple the photo-tag to all proteins within each ROI, achieving a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

STOMP was tested on amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. The technique can be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue. Gel electrophoresis of indiscriminately photo-tagged proteins revealed a different pattern of protein bands compared to the specimen in which amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis.

STOMP combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry. The photo-tagging procedure uses two-photon microscopy to drive microscopic, 3D-resolved photochemistry, offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art. The predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample was Aβ, which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment due to its low overall abundance. This new proteomic technique has great potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification and may provide clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease.
The Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene plays a crucial role in controlling axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons. Disruption of the Fz3 gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus and do not reroute to other trajectories. This stalling defect is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets. This provides in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The experiments implicate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth and highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell–cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth. In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LMCL axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets, essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies. The primary cause of motor axon deficiency in the VIIth, XIIth, phrenic, and dorsal limb nerves in Fz3−/− mice is not defective motor neuron differentiation or excessive motor neuron death, but rather defective axon growth and/or guidance. The majority of Fz3−/− motor axons do not follow erroneous trajectories, suggesting that aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be relevant. A model that could account for the precocious motor neuron death in Fz3−/− embryos invokes the existence of neuronal survival factors produced by intermediate targets along an axon’s trajectory. In Fz3−/− embryos, a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11. 5-E12. 5. This suggests that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons.
The study investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) as enhancers in gene regulation in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. TEs are repetitive DNA sequences that have been co-opted by the genome to regulate gene expression. While previous studies have suggested that TEs are involved in establishing gene regulatory networks, their functional significance remains unclear. To address this, the authors tested a set of long terminal repeat (LTR) TE families for their roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data revealed that a large number of TEs contribute to tissue-specific gene expression programs. However, genetic editing experiments using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR-mediated genetic excision showed that only a minority of TEs play significant roles in gene regulation. The results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development. The study highlights the importance of functional experiments in evaluating the gene regulatory roles of TEs, as some TEs may play minor, redundant, or no role in gene regulation despite strong correlative evidence. The findings also emphasize the need for extensive genetic work to determine the proportion of TE+ enhancers that act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements.
The evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently emerged in at least 60 plant lineages, has long been a subject of interest in the scientific community. Despite its widespread occurrence, the evolutionary paths that led to the development of C4 photosynthesis have remained unclear. To address this knowledge gap, researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3–C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. This analysis revealed that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories.

    A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved. This model was experimentally verified and used to determine the alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis. The results showed that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility is thought to have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait.

    The researchers also developed a predictive Bayesian approach that can infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. This model provided insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, which is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution due to the difficulty of comprehensively exploring the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype experimentally.

    The study found that distinct sub-types of C4 photosynthesis evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures. Early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. This suggests that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits.

    The findings of this study have implications for efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C3 species. By understanding the evolutionary paths that led to the development of C4 photosynthesis, researchers may be able to expand the molecular toolbox available to establish C4 traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds.
The study investigated the ATPase activity of SpoIVA, a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. To address this, the researchers reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. The resulting SpoIVAGTPase protein was functional in vivo and could use either ATP or GTP to induce a similar conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis. However, SpoIVAGTPase only polymerized in the presence of ATP, suggesting a specific requirement for the nucleotide base, not just the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, for its function. The study also found that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase. Furthermore, the researchers observed that SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase failed to undergo nucleotide hydrolysis-mediated structural changes in the presence of low concentrations of GTP, but did so in the presence of higher concentrations of ATP. These findings suggest that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. The study also presents data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA. The results of this study provide new insights into the evolution of nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA and highlight the importance of the nucleotide base in specific biological functions.
The present study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life by restoring leptin signaling in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene at either the fourth or tenth week of age. Leptin plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. The study found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt, and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. These findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. The study suggests that changes in leptin signaling during development can affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. The results indicate that early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. The study highlights the importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin. The findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life, especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide.
Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2, play a crucial role in regulating immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2 receptor. The FLS2 receptor perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. In the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1. This allows for optimum immune activation. Following activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms. The G proteins modulate flg22-triggered immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex. Prior to activation by flg22, the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1, ensuring optimum signaling competence. After flg22 stimulation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1, indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. Introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state. In addition to the ligand-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1, flg22 induces the phosphorylation of XLG2 in the N terminus. The results show that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling, and the findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants. The study collectively supports that plant receptor kinases fulfill the roles of GPCRs by directly coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. The G proteins coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS2 signaling. The heterotrimeric G proteins formed by XLG2/3, AGB1, and AGG1/2 attenuate proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 and PBL20. The regulation of BIK1 stability contributes to the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in flg22-induced immune responses.
The Arabidopsis circadian clock is a complex system that regulates gene expression across the day-night cycle. While a multiple feedback loop circuit has been proposed to generate the 24-hour rhythm, the robustness and coordination of the clock in individual cells and across the plant remain unclear. To address this, researchers examined clock activity at the single cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. The results reveal robust single cell oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity observed, one traveling down and one up the root. The study also found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, particularly in the root tip. A simple model suggests that cell-to-cell coupling and measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves of clock gene expression. The findings provide insight into the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points. The researchers used a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 ( CCA1 ) to examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single cell level over several days. The data reveal that damping of rhythms at the whole plant level is mainly due to desynchronization of oscillating single cells with different periods, rather than noise in gene expression or damping of individual oscillations. The study supports a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants, which is in contrast to earlier studies that suggested cellular oscillations are uncoupled.
The study investigated the neural signatures of disordered multi-talker speech perception in adults with clinically normal hearing. The researchers found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely among individuals with normal hearing, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. A combination of neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. These findings suggest that disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders. The study aimed to develop objective physiological markers that might explain complaints of poor speech communication in individuals with clinically normal hearing. To achieve this, the researchers applied parallel psychophysical and neurophysiological tests of sTFS processing in combination with physiological measures of effortful listening. The results showed that individuals with steeper pupil recruitment functions had more difficulty in the multi-talker speech task, leading to a significant correlation between min-max/half-max pupil change and speech intelligibility threshold. The study also found that the strong association between psychophysical tests for FM detection and speech-in-noise intelligibility can be attributed, at least in part, to encoding of FM cues at early stages of auditory processing. Furthermore, the correlation between low-level FM encoding and speech intelligibility might reflect a correlation between any measure of fast temporal processing fidelity and speech intelligibility. Overall, the study presents a simple battery of behavioral and physiological tests that can account for nearly 80% of the variability in a test of multi-talker speech intelligibility that does not involve linguistic cues. These findings have the potential to inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders.
Biomedical researchers have developed a novel imaging technique to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the living mouse retina. The technique employs 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging and ultrafast camera capture to visualize blood cells without the need for foreign contrast agents. This approach enables the measurement of blood flow in vessels with diameters ranging from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, covering the full spectrum of retinal vessel sizes. The imaging paradigm is paired with an automated analysis workflow, allowing for high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second. This method has the potential to revolutionize the early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries, which are currently limited by the imperfections in the optics of the eye. The study reports the measurement of single-cell velocity and flow rate in 123 vessels across 19 mice, with flow rates ranging from 0.0002 to 1.55 microliters per minute. The results demonstrate the capability to image single blood cells noninvasively in both tight and sparsely packed formations inside microvessels, with sub-micrometer precision when measuring lumen diameters of retinal vessels. This imaging technique may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the central nervous system and provide insights into systemic microvascular health. The findings of this study have the potential to be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation, offering a noninvasive and label-free method for studying blood flow in the retina.
Biologists have long sought to understand the mechanisms that govern the development of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms, particularly in the context of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza ( AM ) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. A key receptor-like kinase, Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK ), has been identified as essential for the development of both symbiotic relationships. However, the mechanisms that distinguish between the two distinct symbiotic developmental fates have remained unclear. To address this knowledge gap, researchers investigated the role of SYMRK and other receptor-like kinases in the development of symbiotic relationships in the legume Lotus japonicus.

    The study found that ectopic expression of the receptor-like kinase genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ), NFR5, and SYMRK initiated spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of L. japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signalling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Notably, only SYMRK overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.

    The study also found that the SYMRK-mediated loss of signalling specificity may be explained by simultaneous complex formation of SYMRK with NFR1 and NFR5, and related LysM-RLKs that mediate recognition of signals from the AM fungus. This complex formation may result in the release of both negative regulatory mechanisms, or by an unbalanced stoichiometry of SYMRK and putative specific negative regulators of AM- and root nodule symbiosis signalling. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms that govern the development of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms, and highlight the importance of SYMRK in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.
A new software toolkit called DeepPoseKit has been developed to enable fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning methods. The toolkit addresses the limitations of current animal pose estimation methods in terms of speed and robustness. DeepPoseKit uses an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model called Stacked DenseNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm to estimate keypoint locations with subpixel precision. This approach improves processing speed by more than two times compared to existing methods without compromising accuracy. The toolkit is designed to be easy to use and has been demonstrated to perform well on multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. DeepPoseKit has the potential to reduce barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences. The software package is freely available under a permissive open-source license and includes code, documentation, and examples. The Stacked DenseNet model used in DeepPoseKit can run inference at a rate of 30–110 Hz, depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps, making it suitable for real-time applications. In contrast to conventional computer-vision methods, deep-learning–based methods can achieve near human-level accuracy by manually annotating data and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm. DeepPoseKit builds on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks and offers considerable improvements over existing models. The toolkit has the potential to lead to larger, higher-resolution, and more reliable behavioral datasets that could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment.
The activation of innate immune cells, such as macrophages, in response to environmental stresses or infection by pathogens triggers the assembly of inflammasomes, which are multi-protein complexes responsible for initiating pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death termed pyroptosis. A recent study has identified an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This disruption results from a drop in NADH levels and the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production, which can be rescued by the addition of products that restore NADH production. The study found that the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium impairs NADH production, leading to the formation of mitochondrial ROS that are essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This suggests that disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and the initiation of inflammation. Furthermore, the study suggests that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and S. typhimurium effectively limited glycolysis through distinct mechanisms, each resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. The study also found that the NAD+ consumption rate increased upon pyruvate treatment, indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream of glycolysis in infected BMDMs. These data indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death. Overall, the study reveals an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.
The PALB2 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosomal integrity by facilitating homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2, two tumor suppressors linked to breast cancer and Fanconi anemia, to coordinate their functions during HDR. In addition to its role as a scaffold protein, PALB2 directly binds to DNA, but the functional significance of this interaction has been poorly understood. Recent studies have identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50% in cells. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD) of PALB2 stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase and exhibits strand exchange activity without the presence of RAD51. Furthermore, the N-DBD can facilitate both forward and inverse strand exchange and can use RNA as a substrate. These findings reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells. The PALB2 N-DBD is essential for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. Mutations in the DNA-binding residues of PALB2 significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency, suggesting that PALB2 interaction with DNA is critical for its function. The PALB2 N-DBD stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro, and its DNA-binding activity is necessary for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the role of PALB2 in maintaining chromosomal integrity and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
Bacterial actin homologue MreB forms antiparallel double filaments in vitro and in vivo. Unlike other actin-like proteins, which assemble from pairs of protofilaments in a parallel fashion, MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that are arranged in an antiparallel manner. This unique architecture is revealed by crystal structures of Caulobacter MreB and confirmed by 3D cryo-EM. The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome. This non-polar nature of MreB filaments also explains common assembly and disassembly kinetics for both filament ends. The mechanism of protofilament formation of C. crescentus MreB is elucidated by crystallography and shown to be similar to that of other actin-like proteins, involving domain closure upon polymerization. Co-crystallization studies of Caulobacter MreB with the antimicrobial reagents A22 and MP265 reveal their inhibitory mechanism and shed light on the activation mechanism of ATP hydrolysis during polymerization. The antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments of C. crescentus MreB is unprecedented within the actin family of proteins and is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance. In vivo site-specific cross-linking demonstrates the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli. The crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerization states of Caulobacter MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes as shown by 3D cryo-EM. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop of Caulobacter MreB ( ΔCcMreBdh ) makes the protein less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB ( ΔCcMreBdh ) reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft. Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B.
The role of APETALA1 (AP1) in petal number robustness has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana and its closely related species Cardamine hirsuta. Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits invariant floral forms, including a consistent number of petals, whereas Cardamine hirsuta displays variable petal number. The genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. This study demonstrates that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator AP1 can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. AP1 is a key regulator of flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs. The Arabidopsis thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling petal number in Cardamine hirsuta. In contrast, the Cardamine hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function, resulting in variable petal number. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where Arabidopsis thaliana AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of all petal number QTL in Cardamine hirsuta. Regulatory changes in AP1 in Cardamine hirsuta have relaxed its epistasis over alleles that cause petal number to vary, exposing cryptic genetic variation that contributes to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of Cardamine hirsuta. The study suggests that AP1 divergence likely exposed hidden genetic variation in Cardamine hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of Cardamine hirsuta. The results indicate that AP1 is a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals in Arabidopsis thaliana to a variable petal number in Cardamine hirsuta. However, AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in Cardamine hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in Arabidopsis thaliana reflects its robustness to genetic variation. Complementation of Arabidopsis thaliana ap1 mutants with the AP1 genomic locus from Cardamine hirsuta resulted in flowers with variable petal number, suggesting that there may be variability in the gene regulatory network controlling petal number in Arabidopsis thaliana that is hidden beneath the uniformity of wild-type development. Ectopic expression of AP1 in third whorl petals of ag mutants in Cardamine hirsuta is associated with an invariant number of petals, whereas endogenous AP1 expression in whorl two of the Cardamine hirsuta floral meristem is associated with variable petal number.
Proinsulin misfolding has been identified as an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The biosynthesis of insulin begins with the folding of the proinsulin precursor, which involves the formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. However, a subset of proinsulin molecules in normal pancreatic islets contains at least one free cysteine thiol, indicating incomplete folding. In islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding environment, non-native proinsulin forms intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. These complexes are more abundant in genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, where they track with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes.

Studies have shown that proinsulin-Cys (B19) and Cys (A20) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes. Proinsulin Cys (B19)-Cys (B19) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, providing a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. In human islets, a subfraction of proinsulin molecules bears unpaired cysteine residues, indicating incomplete folding. These improperly folded proinsulin molecules form aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER, resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes.

The presence of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes has been confirmed in the islets of human beings, as well as in model systems that alter the ER folding environment and in T2D progression prior to the onset of β-cell dedifferentiation or death. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes are more abundant, and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, the increase in these complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Furthermore, in young, normoglycemic homozygous LepRdb/db male mice that are destined for diabetes, proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes are increased slightly above the level observed in heterozygous LepRdb/+ males that do not progress to diabetes. These findings suggest that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with β-cell dysfunction in T2D.
The article investigates the role of Suv39h1, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase, in assembling silent heterochromatin. Suv39h1 recognizes trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) via its chromodomain (CD) and targets specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. The study reveals that Suv39h1's CD (Suv39h1-CD) binds nucleic acids, with a higher affinity for RNA than DNA, and this binding is independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 binds major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowers Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Mutational studies indicate that both the nucleic acid-binding and H3K9me-binding activities of Suv39h1-CD are crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. The results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating SUV39H's target specificity. Suv39h1's nucleic acid-binding activity integrates and cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish/maintain Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin, including H3K9me3 formation, HP1 accumulation, and transcriptionally repressive status. The study also shows that Suv39h1's RNA-binding activity contributes to its stable association with H3K9me3-rich pericentromeric regions. Knockdown of major satellite repeat transcripts further supports the notion that RNA binding of Suv39h1 contributes to its stability on chromatin. The results demonstrate that the four different activities of Suv39h1, including nucleic acid-binding, H3K9me-binding, HP1-binding, and chromatin-binding, cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly.
Title: Entorhinal cortex receptive fields are modulated by spatial attention, even without movement

    The entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation and memory, contains grid cells that allow for the precise decoding of position in space. These cells have been hypothesized to contribute to mental operations beyond navigation, but this requires that their activity does not depend on physical movement. A recent study investigated whether grid cell activity in the entorhinal cortex is modulated by spatial attention, even in the absence of physical movement.

    In the study, two rhesus macaque monkeys were trained to perform a task of covert attention, where they maintained central fixation while attending to a small dot moving around a computer monitor. The researchers recorded the activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex while the monkeys performed the task. The results showed that a significant population of entorhinal cells (20/141, 14%) exhibited spatially structured receptive fields, characterized by a triangular tiling of space. This is in contrast to the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed.

    The study's findings provide evidence that neurons in the macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement to elicit spatial receptive fields. This is consistent with the hypothesis that grid cells participate in a range of cognitive functions, including attention. The researchers suggest that the activation of cells in the entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement through an environment. Previous studies have shown that grid cells can be activated by eye movements in stationary monkeys, and the neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping.

    The study's results have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of spatial representation and attention. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are potentially capable of representing not only gaze location but also the locus of attention in general. The findings provide strong evidence that the activation of cells in the entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement, supporting the hypothesis that grid cells contribute to mental operations beyond navigation.
The article reports on the development and implementation of a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice, with the goal of achieving reproducible results across multiple laboratories. The task, designed for head-fixed mice, assesses both perceptual and value-based decision-making. To ensure reproducibility, a standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures were adopted across seven laboratories in three countries. A total of 140 mice were trained, and over 5 million choices were collected into a publicly available database. The results show that while learning speed varied across mice and laboratories, once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice from different laboratories exhibited similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These findings demonstrate that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior. The study also provides an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision-making in mice. Furthermore, the results suggest a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches. To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, the experimental equipment, software components, and protocols are described and shared with the broader community. The study aims to leverage the arsenal of genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for mouse brains to explore the neural basis of decision-making in multiple laboratories. By comparing results across laboratories, researchers can identify differences that are unlikely to be due to variations in behavior, and the resources provided are expected to catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of the approach, ultimately accelerating the use of mice in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm capable of regenerating all organs, including the gut. Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the authors identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression that were previously undetected by other approaches. These genes are involved in various physiological roles, including metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, and innate immunity, demonstrating a high degree of functional homology with the digestive systems of other animals, including humans.

Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types across species, including the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Spatial LCM enabled the authors to uncover regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly among intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enriched transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, were identified as playing distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance. The depletion of goblet cells was found to reduce the planarians' willingness to feed and viability, while having negligible effects on the regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues.

The study provides a foundational resource for investigating mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. The authors identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and/or maintenance of goblet cells, setting the stage for further studies of this cell type. The characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome enables the identification of genes required for regeneration and functions of distinct intestinal cell types. The findings reinforce the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and indicate that physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs are consolidated in the planarian intestine.
In a study on the sensory coding mechanisms of weakly electric fish, researchers investigated how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to physiological coding of stimuli. Mormyrid fish, which can detect subtle variations in electric communication signals, were found to encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. In contrast, species insensitive to waveform variation produce spontaneously oscillating potentials in their receptors. These oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. The receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. The findings suggest that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. The researchers hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. The study provides the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.

    The study describes a novel mechanism for peripheral sensory coding in which sensory receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets that result in transient synchrony across the population. The degree of synchrony provides information about pulse timing and polarity, but it does not reflect the precise timing cues within the pulse waveform. This is consistent with the inability of these fish to behaviorally detect EOD waveform variation. The researchers investigated how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to differences in peripheral sensory coding. Mormyrid fish communicate by producing a species-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) at variable interpulse intervals (IPIs). However, oscillating receptors are tuned to much lower frequencies than the peak power frequencies of conspecific EODs. Furthermore, these oscillation frequencies confer enhanced sensitivity to IPIs that can only be produced by groups of fish. Therefore, whereas spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals, oscillating receptors appear specialized for detecting signals from a large group.

    Behavioral playback experiments demonstrated that a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity. The results suggest that this novel peripheral coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish. Oscillatory electrical activity is widespread in neural networks. If oscillating receptors facilitate detection of communication signals produced by a group of individuals, then species with oscillating receptors should exhibit selective behavioral responses to submillisecond IPIs, and species with spiking receptors should not. To test this hypothesis, the researchers performed behavioral playback experiments in which they presented a single fish with a train of 10 conspecific EODs at constant IPIs.
Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a virus that infects and kills Bordetella species, the causative agents of whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. The phage has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, approximately 670 Å in diameter, composed of a major capsid protein (MCP) and a cement protein (CP). A recent study used cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the three-dimensional structure of the BPP-1 head at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The resulting atomic model revealed that the MCP and CP adopt two characteristic folds of major virus lineages: jellyroll and HK97/Johnson. Notably, the topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold. This new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old topology, as all other known atomic structures of proteins with the Johnson fold adopt the HK97 topology. The BPP-1 structure also features β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions that contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail, unlike the covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. The termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering. The atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive to stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts. To understand how DENV populations adapt to these different host environments, researchers used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated the fitness effects of all single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This approach allowed them to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population.

The analysis revealed that the continuous influx of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations were found to preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically redundant adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints described in this study mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating that the system recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution.

The researchers used a technique called CirSeq to characterize the fitness landscapes of DENV populations adapting to human and mosquito cells by tracing individual allele trajectories for almost all possible single nucleotide variants across the DENV genome. This analysis revealed the influence of both positive and negative selection in shaping the evolutionary paths of DENV in these distinct cellular environments. Many beneficial mutations were found to be clustered at a few specific locations in the genome, suggesting that adaptation relies on hotspots of host-specific selection.

To further analyze these hotspots of adaptation, the researchers mapped the allele fitness values on the three-dimensional structure of dengue protein E, a well-studied transmembrane protein that forms the outermost layer of the viral envelope. The results suggest that adaptation relies on host-specific beneficial mutations that are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between beneficial and deleterious mutations in shaping the evolution of DENV populations.
The article presents a high-throughput, single-particle tracking study using photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis to investigate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, an active KRas mutant, in U2OS cells. The study reveals that KRasG12D exhibits distinct membrane domains that dictate its diffusion and trafficking properties. The results show that KRasG12D is partitioned into three mobility states: an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, an intermediate mobility state in ~200 nm domains, and a fast diffusion state in the rest of the membrane. The study also demonstrates that KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the partitioning of KRasG12D into the three states remains invariant over a wide range of protein expression levels, indicating that the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D are maintained in a homeostatic condition.

The study further shows that the intermediate and immobile states of KRasG12D are each associated with distinct membrane domains, with measured sizes of ~70 nm and ~200 nm, respectively. These findings are consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane. Based on these results, the authors propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, with implications for Ras multimer formation and signaling.

The study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of KRasG12D on the membrane and sheds light on how complex nanodomains organize to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking. The findings offer useful guidance for future experiments aimed at determining the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and defining the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D and highlights the importance of membrane organization in regulating Ras signaling.
The formation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling gradient is crucial for patterning the dorsoventral (DV) embryonic axis in vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates suggests that the BMP gradient is formed through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often accompanied by ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, a recent study in zebrafish aimed to elucidate the mechanism of BMP gradient formation by precisely quantifying the BMP activity gradient in wild-type and mutant embryos and combining these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen. The analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a BMP transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism, instead supporting a source-sink mechanism. This mechanism relies on a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. The study measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

The researchers established a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish embryos. They integrated the results with a mathematical modeling approach, using the experiments to inform their model selection. The modeling provided information on key parameters to measure to identify the mechanism by which the BMP signaling gradient is formed. The study aimed to determine if the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is predominantly established by matching the BMP expression gradient, as suggested by the graded expression of bmp2b and bmp7a in wild-type embryos. However, three key results do not support this hypothesis.

The study presents a new view of the mechanism by which BMP antagonists and ligand use to establish the BMP signaling gradient patterning the DV axis in zebrafish. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) act as morphogens repeatedly during development, including in patterning the embryonic DV axis, the neural tube, and the Drosophila wing disc. BMP morphogen systems are established by a network of extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism by which the BMP ligands and antagonists shape this gradient is unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including an inverse gradient of BMP antagonists imparting the shape of the BMP signaling gradient and BMP antagonists generating peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions.
The lysosomal transporter MFSD1 plays a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis. MFSD1 is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which mediate secondary active or passive transport processes across cellular membranes. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mfsd1 knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease, indicating that MFSD1 is essential for normal liver function. Proteomics analysis of isolated lysosomes from Mfsd1 knockout mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. GLMP is a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of previously unknown function. The physical interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP is essential for maintaining normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes, and vice versa. Glmp knockout mice exhibit a similar phenotype to Mfsd1 knockout mice, suggesting that GLMP is also essential for liver homeostasis. The data indicate that MFSD1 and GLMP form a tightly linked lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex. MFSD1 is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues and is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady-state conditions. The transport of MFSD1 to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in its N-terminus. Previous studies have identified a large number of novel putative lysosomal transporters, including MFSD1, which was characterized in detail in this study. The characterization of MFSD1 and its accessory subunit GLMP provides new insights into the regulation of lysosomal function and the maintenance of liver homeostasis.
The kinesin motor protein plays a crucial role in microtubule-based transport in eukaryotic cells, which is essential for various cellular processes. To understand the mechanism of kinesin's interaction with microtubules, researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain high-resolution structures of the kinesin motor domain attached to microtubules in two different states: without nucleotides (no-nucleotide) and with ATP bound (ADP•Al•Fx). These structures were compared with existing X-ray crystal structures of ADP-bound kinesin to infer a mechanistic scheme for kinesin's nucleotide-gated force-generation.

The cryo-EM reconstructions revealed that microtubule attachment is mediated by a conserved 'linchpin' residue in kinesin (N255), which triggers a 'clamshell' opening of the nucleotide cleft and the release of ADP. The binding of ATP re-closes the cleft, tightly coupling to the translocation of cargo via kinesin's 'neck linker' element. This structural transition is analogous to the nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors.

The researchers also identified sites in the kinesin fold that uncouple the motor's nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, providing a structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. Cryo-EM analysis of the ADP and ATP analog-bound states of a point mutant of the kinesin construct revealed two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin, where the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile.

The high-resolution structures of kinesin on microtubules provide a basis for understanding the nucleotide-gated force-generation mechanism of kinesin. The findings suggest that microtubules regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, allowing for an elegant structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of kinesin's microtubule-attached cycle and have implications for understanding the regulation of microtubule-based transport in eukaryotic cells.
A novel protein quality control (QC) pathway has been identified at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This pathway involves the recognition and degradation of misfolded proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function. Two temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral MOM proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, were used as model QC substrates. These proteins were found to be degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts was mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts was ubiquitinated primarily by San1.

    The degradation of both substrates required the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, indicating a role for chaperones in mitochondrial-associated degradation (MAD). Additionally, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1, and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor Ubx2 were implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway that involves a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors, distinguishing it from other cellular QC pathways.

    The ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts were found to be dependent on the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex, which can be recruited to substrates via Cdc48's interaction with co-factors. The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex is essential for efficient proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates. In contrast, deletion of the proteasome shuttling factor Ddi1 did not affect the degradation of sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts, further distinguishing MAD from endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD).

    Mitochondrial proteins are subject to ongoing oxidative insults that can result in damage, misfolding, and dysfunction. The study found that ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts accumulated in the mitochondrial pellet fraction under conditions of proteasome impairment, indicating that ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates require the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex for efficient proteasomal degradation.
In vivo imaging of mouse skin using an extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) FRET biosensor has revealed the propagation of ERK activation in the epidermis. ERK is a key effector of many growth signalling pathways, and its activation is crucial for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues. Under steady-state conditions, bursts of ERK activation patterns were observed in the epidermis, where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. This phenomenon, named Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution ( SPREAD ), was found to occur at a frequency that correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs were also stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) in a manner dependent on epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) and their cognate ligands. Furthermore, at the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as a trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. The study also found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. The results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue. The ERK activation pattern originated from a few cells and radially propagated mainly in the basal layer of the epidermis and to a lesser extent in the suprabasal layer. SPREADs were also observed in the epidermis of backskin, indicating that SPREADs are generally observed in mouse epidermis. The study exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK to monitor ERK activity in epidermal cells at single cell resolution. Long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagates radially up to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 min until disappearance. The study proposes how dynamically growth signal is regulated in steady-state and wounded skin in a living tissue by showing two types of novel ERK activation patterns.
The cyanobacterial circadian clock has been found to follow midday in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The circadian clock is a biological oscillation that regulates daily changes in physiology, but its entrainment to external cycles is not well understood. In this study, the authors developed experimental platforms to drive the cyanobacterial circadian clock in vivo and in vitro, and found that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A general mathematical framework was developed based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments. This framework captures the entrained behavior of the circadian clock quantitatively with a small number of parameters, and can be used to guide the design of experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features. The cyanobacterial clock's precisely defined nature facilitates such experiments, and the model is expected to be useful for other organisms as well. Biochemical simulation of seasonal effects in the reconstituted KaiABC oscillator showed a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins. The data reduction achieved in the linear model holds the promise of predicting the behavior of the circadian rhythms in many time-varying environments from a minimal data set that characterizes oscillator response, and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms. The analysis suggests that a key determinant of entrained behavior is how the clock limit cycle is deformed by coupling to the environment.
The loss of the transcription factor Meis1 has been identified as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. Genome-wide association studies have implicated Meis1 in the regulation of cardiac rhythmicity and susceptibility to SCD. To investigate the role of Meis1 in cardiac regulation, researchers inactivated Meis1 in the neural crest of mice and observed an altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects. These defects increased the susceptibility to SCD.

    Further investigation revealed that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1-deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. The researchers also found that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, and that the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. These results suggest that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation.

    The study demonstrated that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation. The loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. The researchers also found that following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised.

    These findings complement previous studies demonstrating Meis1 function in the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis, particularly following myocardial infarction. However, cardiac functions were not affected following specific Meis1 inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes. The study highlights the importance of Meis1 in the regulation of sympathetic neurons and its role in mediating susceptibility to SCD. The results suggest that Meis1 is a novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation and that its loss can lead to an imbalance in sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions, increasing the risk of SCD.
The formation of biofilms, surface-attached bacterial communities, exhibits a wide range of morphologies. Despite the identification of structural and regulatory components necessary for biofilm formation, the mechanisms by which these components contribute to biofilm surface morphology are not well understood. This study investigates the morphogenesis of biofilms using Vibrio cholerae as a model system, combining mechanical measurements, theory, simulation, quantitative image analysis, surface energy characterization, and mutagenesis. The results show that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, play a crucial role in biofilm morphogenesis. These instabilities are driven by differences in interfacial energies, which dictate the creation or annihilation of new or existing interfaces. Feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour. The study suggests that exploiting mechanical principles to drive key morphogenic events is an ancient process, occurring in bacteria and reused in eukaryotes. Biofilms represent a tractable model system for investigating the general role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a convenient system for morpho-engineering. The study proposes a mechanomorphogenesis model in which biofilms first wrinkle and then delaminate as growth builds up compressive stress. This model predicts that changing the spatial distribution of mechanical stress can alter biofilm topography. The study also highlights the potential for discovering new genes and compounds that alter biofilm morphology by altering mechanics to address biofilm-related problems. The findings have implications for understanding morphogenesis processes in higher organisms and suggest that mechanical instability and interfacial energy are key drivers of biofilm morphogenesis.
The neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), also known as REST, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in neurons. Recent studies have shown that NRSF is involved in the development of epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In this study, researchers investigated the mechanisms by which NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis, the process of generating epileptic neuronal networks.

The study found that severe seizures, which can lead to epilepsy, increase the levels of NRSF in the mature hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory and learning. However, surprisingly, this increase in NRSF levels did not lead to the repression of all potential NRSF target genes. Instead, only a small subset of these genes, approximately 10%, were repressed by NRSF in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy. The repression of these genes was rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked, suggesting that NRSF is directly responsible for their repression.

Further analysis revealed that the subset of genes repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, a property that made them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels. This selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a critical role in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts. The genes selectively regulated by NRSF during epileptogenesis coded for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function, suggesting that their repression may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

The study used a combination of large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. The results showed that a twofold to threefold increase in NRSF levels, induced by epilepsy-provoking seizures, led to the repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, and these were rescued by interfering with NRSF function. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of NRSF in epileptogenesis and highlights the importance of dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes in influencing neuronal properties.
The mammalian olfactory system processes sensory information through parallel pathways formed by mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) in the olfactory bulb. These parallel pathways are a common feature of many sensory systems, but how local circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in these pathways remains poorly understood. This study investigated the parallel pathways formed by MCs and TCs in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. The results show that differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations suggest that these circuit-level differences allow MCs and TCs to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways. The study proposes a mechanism of activity-dependent lateral inhibition in MCs and TCs, where the levels of activity in the olfactory bulb circuit consisting of M72 M/TCs (presynaptic M/TCs) and the recorded M/TCs (postsynaptic M/TCs) and the associated GCs (granule cells) are schematically represented. The findings suggest that the combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type. The study highlights the importance of understanding how local circuits support feature selectivity in parallel streams, particularly in brain areas where distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources. The results also suggest that the mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared across sensory systems, such as the visual system, where feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types.
The M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allostery in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has been studied to elucidate the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects. Allosteric interactions were investigated in monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor using a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. The results showed that allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers.

Molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level were used to examine the electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery. The simulations started from the crystal structure of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist iperoxo (4MQS). The ligand and accessory proteins were removed, and conformations of the receptor were sampled from a canonical ensemble accessible within a period of 30 ns. The simulations revealed that the complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

The M2 muscarinic receptor has been a prototype for studying allosteric effects within the broader family of GPCRs. Most studies of the interaction of an allosteric ligand with the allosteric site have been based on the modulation of events at the orthosteric site, typically on receptors in native membranes or detergent-solubilized extracts. However, the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in the multiphasic effects of allosteric ligands on the dissociation rate of orthosteric antagonists and their binding at equilibrium. To understand how a multimeric complex might account for allosteric behavior that resists explanation in terms of monomers, the study compared positive and negative allosteric modulators for their effects on oligomers and purified monomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor.
The study investigated the role of SETD2, a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), in the DNA damage response (DDR) following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The results show that SETD2 is required for the activation of ATM, a key kinase involved in the DDR, and for the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. Furthermore, SETD2 is necessary for the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, which are essential for homologous recombination repair of DSBs. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells, depletion of SETD2 impairs DNA damage signaling and leads to decreased cell survival after DNA damage. Notably, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells fail to activate p53, a tumor suppressor protein that is rarely mutated in ccRCC. This suggests that loss of SETD2 may provide an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53. The study reveals a novel role for SETD2 in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage and provides a functional link between altered chromatin states and the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity. The findings have implications for understanding the impact of SETD2 mutations in cancer, particularly in ccRCC, where a high rate of genomic alterations occurs in parallel to inactivating mutations and deletions of histone modifiers, such as SETD2.
A missense variant in the Rasgrp1 gene, Rasgrp1Anaef, has been identified as a major source of genetic variation in mice. This mutation affects the EF hand of the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, leading to the accumulation of a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. In contrast to previously described autoimmune mutations in Rasgrp1, Zap70, or Lat, Rasgrp1Anaef has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal TCR repertoires. However, it results in the peripheral accumulation of a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ T-helper cells and the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Notably, Rasgrp1Anaef increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells, which is distinct from its well-known role in thymic positive selection.

    Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that overactive mTOR signaling within naïve CD4 T cells is a key component driving two abnormalities: a constitutive increase in CD44 expression in naïve CD4 T cells and a gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios+ CD44hi CD4 cells and autoantibodies. The effect of Rasgrp1Anaef on Ras/ERK signaling in vivo is much milder than expected from its effects in in vitro assays. Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice.

    Thymocyte selection in Rasgrp1Anaef mice is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. A novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor, was used to identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells, and CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios, and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation. These findings reveal a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells and dissociate this new function of Rasgrp1 from its well-known role in thymic positive selection.
The study investigated the role of Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the presence of oncogenic Kras mutations. The researchers used a mouse model to suppress Arid1a expression in adult acinar cells harboring KrasG12D mutations and found that this led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, silencing Arid1a during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, resulted in retention of acinar cell fate. These findings suggest that Arid1a acts as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and that the timing and genetic context of Arid1a inactivation influence the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

Suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells with oncogenic Kras mutations accelerated acinar-to-ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous pancreatic cancer precursor lesions, which could not be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. Alcian blue staining confirmed the retention of mucinous lesions in Arid1a-restored mice. These results indicate that Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context.

The study also investigated the mechanism by which Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. Perturbation of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is expected to impact the expression of SWI/SNF target genes. Transcriptional and chromatin profiling data suggested that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. These findings imply that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar-to-ductal trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras, a critical rate-limiting step in Kras-driven pancreatic neoplasia.

The study demonstrates that acute loss of Arid1a in the setting of a pre-existing Kras mutation rapidly perturbs the identity and function of pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing their sensitivity to metaplastic and PanIN-inducing signals stemming from oncogenic Kras. The results suggest that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic Kras.
The study investigated the effects of social isolation on the intrinsic properties of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in preadolescent mice. The researchers found that social isolation for less than 24 hours increased the first spike latency (FSL) and decreased the excitability of CRH neurons in female mice, but not in age-matched male mice. In contrast, acute physical stress, induced by swim stress, increased FSL in both group-housed females and single-housed males. The increase in FSL following social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. These findings suggest that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

    The study used acute brain slices to examine the synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN. Activation of these cells is essential for launching the neuroendocrine response to stress. The researchers hypothesized that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a stress. To test this idea, single-housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20 minutes, and the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed. The results showed that males and females react differently to some stressors but not others. Specifically, social isolation has definitive, CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in female, but not male mice. By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress. Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males.

    The study's findings demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons. The results suggest that female mice may interpret social isolation as a stress, leading to changes in the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons. In contrast, male mice do not exhibit similar changes in response to social isolation. These findings have implications for understanding the sex-specific effects of social isolation on the neuroendocrine response to stress.
Hemoglobin (Hb) is a model protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates, and its affinity and cooperativity for oxygen binding are crucial for tissue oxygen delivery. Previous research suggested that only Hb affinity determines molecular adaptations, but a new study reveals that both affinity and cooperativity play a role in optimizing tissue oxygen delivery. The study derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model, creating a ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ that describes this relation. The results show that mammalian Hb cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape, allowing for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. This mechanism underlies body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The study found that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply. In small-sized animals with high metabolic rates, Hb presents lower affinity for oxygen than in large-sized animals, reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb. The study also found that the greater an animal’s metabolic rate, the higher the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb, and an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity. These findings support the hypothesis that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution to give rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding, yielding a different maximum nH value in each case. The study provides evolutionary and functional insights into the mechanism underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb.
Malaria infection begins with the injection of Plasmodium sporozoites into the skin of a mammalian host by an Anopheles mosquito. The process of how sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical but poorly understood step in the infection process. A recent study used intravital microscopy in mice to examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels. The results suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: avascular motility and perivascular motility. Avascular motility is characterized by high speed and less confinement, resulting in maximal displacements in areas far from blood vessels. In contrast, perivascular motility is more constrained and observed when the parasite glides in proximity to a blood vessel. The study found that the curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. The gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity, and previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis. However, an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed until now. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 minutes after inoculation revealed significant changes in their motility in this time frame. The data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite. Mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. These findings suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene. The study provides new insights into how the sporozoite navigates through and out of the dermis, and highlights the importance of gliding speed and adhesive properties for successful blood vessel invasion.
In a study on the evolutionary adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the removal of the polarity gene BEM1, researchers observed a reproducible trajectory of adaptive mutations that led to a substantial recovery in cell polarization. BEM1 is a relatively young component in polarity establishment, and its deletion revealed alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules. The bem1∆ lineages initially increased in fitness and then slowly reached >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors after 1000 generations of evolution. Genome sequencing and monitoring of polarization revealed a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. These mutations led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization, with bem1∆ cells often containing more than one polarity site, suggesting a weaker positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization. The results demonstrate that cells can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. The study highlights the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately, which also make it possible for them to adapt to strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of cellular functions and the ability of cells to adapt to strong perturbations. The study provides evidence that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins, and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. The results are consistent with previous research on the loss of genes in the descent of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from an ancestor that existed 100 Mya ago, and the recruitment of new functions by adaptations that alter the function of existing genes and create genes de novo.
The neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human medial prefrontal cortex were investigated using a multi-alternative choice task in which decisions had financial consequences that persisted over time. Participants were presented with prospects that provided sustained financial returns and had to decide whether to accept or reject them. The study aimed to understand the computational mechanisms underlying economic commitments and their neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The results showed that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected or deferred accepting a prospect. The dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases: a bias to defer commitments to later and a bias to weight potential losses more heavily than gains. These biases paradoxically maximized reward in the task. The findings provide fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and the computation of value in the mPFC. The study builds on previous research that has examined the neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering participants a succession of independent gambles or unrelated consumer choices. However, this study is the first to investigate the neural mechanisms of economic commitment, which often involves a period of deliberation before final acceptance or rejection. The results suggest that the rmPFC and dACC play distinct roles in economic decision-making, with the rmPFC integrating value signals over time and the dACC encoding value when participants reject or defer accepting a prospect. The study's findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of economic decision-making and the computation of value in the mPFC.
This study investigated the role of paraspeckles in controlling circadian gene expression in pituitary cells. Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that form around the long non-coding RNA Neat1 and RNA-binding proteins. They are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by retaining mRNAs containing 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences ( IRAlu ) in the nucleus. The study found that all components of paraspeckles, including four major proteins and Neat1, displayed a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. Furthermore, the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA, which was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, it was shown that IRAlu drove a circadian expression of EGFP protein. These findings suggest that paraspeckles control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus. The study also found that the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA, which was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. This suggests that paraspeckles play a crucial role in controlling circadian gene expression in pituitary cells. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of circadian gene expression and highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in controlling gene expression. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for circadian-related disorders.
The active-zone protein Munc13 has been found to play a crucial role in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) at nerve terminals. VGCCs are essential for converting electrical signals into chemical communication, and their proper functioning is critical for synaptic transmission. Munc13, an active-zone protein involved in exocytosis, has been shown to interact with VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in its C2B domain. This interaction is essential for controlling the behavior of VGCCs during various forms of activity, including high-frequency action potential bursts and single action potential stimuli.

    The study demonstrates that the removal of Munc13 or its replacement with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters the response of synaptic VGCCs to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts, as well as calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These findings illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and suggest that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.

    The interaction between Munc13 and VGCCs has been pinpointed to a specific site on the C2B domain of Munc13, which is orthogonal to the potential membrane-interacting loops of this domain. This interaction site is critical for controlling calcium channel use-dependence on millisecond to second time scales at nerve terminals. The study also shows that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions, suggesting that this modulation is mediated by a direct VGCC-Munc13 interaction.

    To further investigate the significance of the Munc13-VGCC interaction, the study examined the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. The results show that the removal of Munc13 leads to a complete block of exocytosis, and that VGCCs fail to reactivate in the absence of Munc13. This suggests that the increase in exocytosis during high-frequency stimulation in the absence of Munc13 is a direct effect of the lack of Munc13-VGCC interaction, rather than a secondary effect of reduced exocytosis.

    Overall, the study provides compelling evidence that Munc13 plays a critical role in controlling VGCC function and synaptic transmission, and highlights a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The findings have broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled, and suggest that Munc13 is a key regulator of information transfer at nerve terminals.
Plant cells in the epidermis of many plant species exhibit a complex, puzzle-shaped morphology that has long been observed but not fully understood. Recent research suggests that this shape is an adaptation to mitigate mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. Isotropic growth, where cells expand equally in all directions, can lead to the formation of large, isodiametric cells that are prone to bulging under the stress produced by turgor pressure. To prevent this, puzzle-shaped cells with lobes and indentations emerge, effectively reducing the open area of the cell and minimizing stress on the cell wall.

    Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of 3D pressurized cells demonstrates that cell shape significantly influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. In isotropically growing tissues, such as the epidermis of broad leaves, puzzle-shaped cells provide a solution to the problem of excessive stress. By analyzing the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana, the researchers found that puzzle-shaped cells allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues without inducing high stresses.

    In contrast, stems, roots, and siliques exhibit anisotropic growth, where cells can simply elongate without the need for puzzle-shaped cells. The strict correspondence between fruit shape and puzzle-shaped epidermal cells supports the prediction that puzzle shapes are required to allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues but are not necessary in elongated organs. The researchers propose that plant cells regulate their shape to prevent their LEC (a proxy for stress) from becoming too large.

    Mechanically, plant cells are similar to small balloons inflated with considerable turgor pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells and up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata. The researchers suggest that the puzzle shape is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces acting on turgid plant cells in the epidermis. Simulation models show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape, supporting the idea that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.
The assembly of human pre-spliceosomes across introns and exons is a crucial step in the splicing process of pre-mRNA molecules. Human genes often contain multiple introns, which necessitate mechanisms to define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. A recent study investigated the dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to understand how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. The study found that the U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency of U2 subcomplex recruitment to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs. The study suggests an ordered human pre-spliceosome assembly pathway in which stable U2 association in the presence of ATP requires prior U1 binding, in contrast to the branched pathway observed in S. cerevisiae. The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5' splice site are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream or upstream of the 5' splice site. Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways: cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly. The study also shows that a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5' splice sites, which dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation.
A novel ubiquitin-dependent folding system has been identified that operates on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to assist in the folding of membrane proteins. This system involves the ubiquitination of a specific lysine residue on the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, which retains it in the ER and prevents degradation. The ubiquitination of Lys-1403 on LRP6 is thought to interact with a putative ER-ubiquitin binding protein that acts as a chaperone, providing the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a process favored by palmitoylation. However, if folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and the anthrax toxin receptor 2, which are involved in severe human diseases. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP19 is responsible for removing ubiquitin from LRP6, allowing it to exit the ER. This system is conceptually analogous to the glucosylation-deglucosylation cycle that occurs in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. To avoid infinite futile cycles, folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are polyubiquitinated and targeted to degradation. The ubiquitin-dependent folding system provides a novel mechanism for controlling the proteostasis of membrane proteins and has implications for understanding the folding and quality control of proteins in the ER.
Title: Sex differences in learning from exploration
    Abstract: Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get ‘stuck’ in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

., 2019; Pisupati et al., 2019 ), sex-differences in exploration could contribute to performance differences and variability seen across tasks and speciess ( Grissom and Reyes, 2019; van den Bos et al., 2013 ). To examine whether there are sex differences in exploration, we trained male and female mice on a classic explore/exploit task, a spatial restless two-armed bandit ( Ebitz et al., 2018 ). Males showed higher levels of exploration than females throughout the task

., 2021b ). Here, we applied computational tools to characterize sex differences in the latent variables underlying behavior to understand sex differences in a key cognitive process regulating reward-guided behaviors: balancing exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, we must balance two goals: exploiting rewarding options when they are available, but also exploring alternatives that could be more rewarding or provide new information about the world

. The results of HMM model and RL models revealed significant sex differences in exploration, paralleled by sex differences in rate of learning. What remains unclear is how sex, explore-exploit states, and reward outcomes all interact together to influence the animals’ choices

Sex mechanisms biasing the preferred approaches taken during cognitive tasks are potentially significant contributors to task performance. We used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment

. 00001 ). To understand how reward and reward omission differentially affect choice across sexes, we conducted post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses. We found that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely than the males to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial ( Figure 4A, sex X reward interaction, p < 0. 000001, Supplementary file 1; post hoc t-test: t ( 254 ) = 5. 53, p < 0. 0001 ).
In the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. However, the mechanism by which hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not well understood. To address this question, researchers used a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals) in ERAD.

The results show that Doa10 is a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. The TM segment of a substrate interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. In contrast, luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with their unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. This process reveals how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction.

The study used a reconstituted system to mechanistically investigate membrane protein extraction, without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation. The results demonstrate that Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase and show how it cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. The study also addresses the question of whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state, if unfolding occurs prior to retrotranslocation, or if unfolding is directly coupled to retrotranslocation.

Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments and has been suggested to act as a retrotranslocase for membrane proteins. The study provides new insights into the ERAD pathway and the role of Doa10 in the extraction of membrane proteins. The results have implications for our understanding of protein quality control pathways in the ER and other organelles, where membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol.
Drosophila Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Hh proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. A study investigated the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs using Ci variants expressed at physiological levels. The results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor. This indicates that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. Furthermore, processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2 or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing. The study suggests that Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing. The results also show that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing. Animals lacking both Fu kinase and Su(fu) develop normal wings, although late third instar wing discs lack anterior En induction. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Hh signaling and its role in development and tissue homeostasis. The findings have implications for understanding the causes of developmental birth defects and cancer associated with aberrant Hh protein production, distribution, and responses.
This study investigated the role of calretinin (CR) positive neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn in sensory processing and pain signaling. The dorsal horn is a critical area in the spinal cord where nociceptive information is relayed to higher brain centers. The researchers used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate CR interneurons, which are a subpopulation of neurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin. The results showed that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target. The study confirms that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn means they are ideally positioned to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. The results are compatible with current models of dorsal horn microcircuitry, which place CR neurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM neurons to activate lamina I projection neurons and initiate pain signaling. The study extends the current view of excitatory interneurons in spinal sensory processing, which ascribes a relative limited role of linking low threshold modality ( innocuous ) tactile input to excite more dorsal nociceptive circuitry.
The study investigated the role of Ras-associated binding protein 23 (RAB23) in the regulation of early osteogenesis. RAB23 is a gene that, when mutated, is associated with Carpenter Syndrome, a condition characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities, including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand the function of RAB23 in skull development, researchers generated mice deficient in RAB23 (Rab23-/-) that survived to an age where skeletal development could be studied. These mice exhibited premature fusion of multiple sutures, resulting from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture.

The study found that FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling was elevated in Rab23-/- sutures, leading to an imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling, and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation, reduced osteogenic gene expression, and prevented craniosynostosis. The results suggest that RAB23 acts as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, as well as a non-canonical regulator of GLI1 through pERK1/2.

Further investigation revealed that disruption of RAB23 leads to upregulation of Pitx2, Fgf10, and Fgfr1b expression, decreased p38, and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling, along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation. RAB23 was found to regulate the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, repress Hh, and inhibit osteoprogenitor expansion. Additionally, RAB23 represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling, which directly regulates osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation, and represses GLI1.

The study concludes that RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity, as well as the activation of GLI1. RAB23 controls suture morphogenesis and maintains suture patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway, and the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2. GLI1 contributes to the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche, and FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1 signaling regulate osteoprogenitor cell proliferation. The study highlights the importance of RAB23 in the regulation of early osteogenesis and its potential role in the development of craniosynostosis.
The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays a crucial role in maintaining epigenetic repression of genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it remains unclear whether this epigenetic memory is stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes (cis memory) or in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors (trans memory). To address this question, researchers investigated the inheritance of gene expression states at the Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis. FLC is a key regulator of flowering time, and its expression is repressed by PRC2 in response to prolonged cold exposure, a process known as vernalization.

The study used a novel assay to visualize the mitotic heritability of FLC expression states at the single-cell level. By crossing FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants, the researchers generated F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. The results showed that one copy of FLC can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as the plants develop. This demonstrates that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored locally in the chromatin environment of the gene, rather than in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors.

The study provides evidence that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance, constituting a cis memory system. This finding has implications for our understanding of how cells remember past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, and how this information is passed on to daughter cells. The results also suggest that local chromatin states are not dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors, but rather are determined by the chromatin environment of individual genes. This has important implications for our understanding of gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance in plants and animals.
BiP, the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Hsp70 chaperone, forms oligomers that are poorly understood in terms of their structure and functional significance. Using site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking, researchers have probed the architecture of BiP oligomers and found that they consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another. This interaction attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, as well as slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, indicating the relative inertness of the oligomers. This suggests that equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale. The findings are consistent with a model in which competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions. BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short timescale. This scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client ( oligomerizing ) over other clients as ER calcium levels decline. The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP. Enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele, and reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR but made redundant following resolution of the insult. Exploring the relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones is confounded by powerful feedback that dominates the unfolded protein responses and couples chaperone production to the levels of unfolded protein stress.
The near-atomic cryoEM structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the genus Potexvirus (family Alphaflexiviridae), has been determined at 3.9 Å resolution using electron cryomicroscopy. PepMV is a flexible filamentous virus that contains several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The structure of PepMV CP has been modeled, revealing its interactions with viral RNA. Notably, the overall fold of PepMV CP shows homology with nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), a group of enveloped negative-sense ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP lies in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of their distinct multimeric assemblies: a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein.

The structural homology between PepMV CP and phlebovirus NP suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic positive-sense and negative-sense ssRNA viruses. Phleboviruses are enveloped viruses with a segmented negative-sense ssRNA genome, and their NPs are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) protected inside an envelope. In contrast, potexviruses are non-enveloped and contain several hundred copies of CP arranged in a helical fashion protecting a positive-sense ssRNA.

Flexible filamentous viruses, including PepMV, are economically important plant pathogens that have a significant impact on agriculture. The high-resolution structures of flexuous filamentous plant viruses have been determined for representatives of the genus Potexvirus, including PepMV, PapMV, and BaMV. However, it is unclear whether members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses, such as Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae, and Potyviridae, have a similar fold in their CPs. The structural homology between PepMV CP and phlebovirus NP highlights the evolutionary relationships between eukaryotic positive-sense and negative-sense ssRNA viruses.
Title: Nanoscale Binding Site Localization by Molecular Distance Estimation on Native Cell Surfaces Using Topological Image Averaging

    A novel method, SiteLoc, has been developed for imaging-based molecular localization of binding sites on cellular surface proteins with nanometer-scale precision. This technique is essential for understanding the immunological outcome of host-target interactions, which is crucial for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Traditional methods for epitope identification are often costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis.

    Current techniques for nanometer-scale localization on microscopy data, such as particle-averaging strategies, are not effective for binding sites on proteins with heterogeneous expression on the cellular surface. These methods are typically designed for identical or spherical particles, making them unsuitable for unaltered cells with varying surface morphology. Super-resolution techniques, such as iPALM, STORM, and STED, can achieve nanometer-scale resolution but are expensive and require complex sample preparation.

    SiteLoc overcomes these limitations by using topological image averaging to estimate the distance between bound ligands and a reference surface. This method achieves nanometer-scale precision by reducing the dimensionality of surface data within an image plane. The location of a binding site is determined by calculating the average distance between the ligand channel and a reference signal channel using the averaged fluorescent signal along a cell contour.

    The efficacy of SiteLoc was demonstrated through site localization measurements on antibody-coated bacteria, which agreed well with previously reported data. The method was also shown to accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. SiteLoc has the potential to facilitate the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines by providing fast and efficient screening of epitope locations on native cell surfaces.
Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by various factors, including peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. However, the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance remains unclear, particularly in the context of hypoxic response in individual tissues and its effect on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. This study investigates the role of peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin, a large vascular bed, in influencing cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. The results demonstrate that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. This study provides the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia.

The study focuses on the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed and analyzes the effect of loss of hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response. The results show that mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis exhibit significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals. Furthermore, the study reveals that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute, and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia.

The study proposes a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin. According to this model, hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO-mediated increase in vascular diameter and resulting increases in perfusion, followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine. These findings suggest that peripheral tissues, such as the skin, play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia and that oxygen sensing in these tissues can directly modify cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia. The study highlights the importance of peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin in regulating systemic vascular pressure and cardiovascular response to hypoxia.
Biomedical researchers have developed a refined optogenetic method for mapping neural circuits with single-neuron resolution. This approach combines two-photon excitation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2) with temporal focusing and restricted expression of ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. The result is a reliable method for evoking action potentials in individual neurons, verifying spike generation with GCaMP6s, and determining the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. This method overcomes previous limitations of optogenetic mapping, which often left an indeterminate region of the circuit map coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron, and could be compromised by unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons. By restricting ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites, researchers can selectively target single neurons and avoid confounding sources of light-induced electrical responses. This refined method enables the evaluation of synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution, which is critical for understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits. The synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is the physiological basis for the interpretation of sensory input and production of behavioral responses. The ability to map functional connectivity with single-cell resolution is essential for elucidating circuit function, and this refined optogenetic method provides a powerful tool for achieving this goal. The method has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of neural circuits and their role in various physiological and pathological processes.
The interaction mode of transcription factors (TFs) on eukaryotic genomes has been a subject of ongoing debate. Recent single-molecule data on the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 were previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, a rigorous biophysical analysis reveals that the calculated quantity does not determine binding order, but rather energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instead, the data suggest that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, where the expression of Sox2 increases Oct4’s genomic binding, while the expression of Oct4 decreases Sox2’s binding. This phenomenon can arise from either energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. The genomic-diversity model at thermodynamic equilibrium can account for the observed data, indicating that Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome. This finding is unexpected and highlights the complexity of TF interactions on DNA. The single-molecule methods used in the study provide novel detection capabilities for unraveling such mechanisms. The implications of this finding will need to be addressed in future studies. The analysis also suggests the possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA, which has not been previously found in living cells. The study demonstrates that single-molecule data, when coupled with the experimental strategy, can provide more information than expected. The variation in sign of cooperativity across the genome has significant ramifications, indicating that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across genomic loci in vivo. This can be explained by either energy expenditure maintaining loci at which Sox2 and Oct4 bind away from thermodynamic equilibrium or mixed cooperativity across the genome, where Sox2 and Oct4 help each other through positive cooperativity at some loci and hinder each other through negative cooperativity at other loci.
Drosophila melanogaster display a strong aversive response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are important immune system infection cues. This response is mediated by gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors, and the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. These findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as a conserved molecular mechanism. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1, suggesting a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved. In support of this, blocking neurotransmission in gustatory neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin abolished avoidance of LPS, indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. Furthermore, dTrpA1-deficient mutants preferred laying eggs on control food rather than on food contaminated with E. coli, highlighting the importance of TRPA1 in LPS avoidance. These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria.
Zfp335 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of naïve T cells, which are essential for immune function. A mouse mutant, bloto, harbors a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp335 and exhibits a deficiency in naïve T cells due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins in the thymus and continues in the periphery. This defect affects T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress and is not attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl2-dependent survival. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to a single gene. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target gene, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation. The study reveals that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes and identifies a set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes. Decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes, providing evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation. Ankle2 is identified as a functional target gene of Zfp335 and its dysregulation by Zfp335 contributes to the maturation defect in blt/blt T cells. The study demonstrates that the maturation defect in blt/blt mice is independent of thymic selection or effects on proliferation, but is associated with reduced viability. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing T cell maturation and identify Zfp335 as a critical regulator of this process.
The relationship between messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea has been a long-standing assumption in gene expression analysis. However, recent studies have shown that this correlation is often imperfect due to various factors, including codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. A new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, has been identified as a significant contributor to the discrepancy between mRNA and protein abundance. This factor refers to the tendency of mRNAs to avoid interactions with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which can affect translational efficiency.

    The study found that for 97% of species, there is a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls, indicating a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, the researchers demonstrated that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. This suggests that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.

    A meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data revealed that mRNAs with low avoidance values produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. The study also found that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most (73%) of the prokaryotic phyla, indicating a signature of selection that acts to minimize these interactions. However, the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely due to the large number of potential interacting RNA species in prokaryotic systems.

    The results indicate that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels, and that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled. The study suggests that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is at least as good an explanation of variation in protein abundance as either codon usage and internal mRNA secondary structure. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the regulation of protein expression in bacteria and archaea and highlight the importance of considering stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions in gene expression analysis.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MN). A key pathological event in ALS is the denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), which occurs prior to symptom onset and is observed in both human patients and animal models of the disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of NMJ denervation in ALS remain unclear. To investigate this, researchers used in vivo imaging to study the dynamics of NMJ denervation in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1G37R mice) over a three-month period.

The study revealed that single motor-units (MUs) are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37R mice, indicating that NMJ denervation is a complex and dynamic process. Weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting, resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These findings suggest that NMJ denervation in ALS is not simply a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration, but rather a dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation.

The study highlights a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration, which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS. However, the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation, suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation. Local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling occur early at the NMJ in ALS, and the study's findings support the "dying-back hypothesis," which proposes that local branch-specific degeneration contributes to NMJ denervation. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of NMJ denervation in ALS and have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or slow disease progression.
Title: Estrogen Receptor Alpha in the Brain Mediates Tamoxifen-Induced Changes in Physiology in Mice

    Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is a common treatment for breast cancer patients, significantly improving survival rates. However, long-term tamoxifen treatment is associated with undesirable side effects, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. To better understand the mechanisms underlying these side effects, researchers investigated the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the brain in mediating tamoxifen-induced changes in physiology in mice.

    Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA) of mice. These expression changes are dependent on ERα, as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Furthermore, ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings suggest that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice.

    The study demonstrated that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the tamoxifen-induced changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA and the effects on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. The results indicate that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. Given the known roles of ERα in mediating many aspects of physiology, the study suggests that loss of ERα would also affect physiological responses to tamoxifen in mice.

    The researchers measured body temperature, movement, and bone density in ERα conditional knockout (Esr1 cKO) mice treated equivalently and concurrently with wild-type animals. The results showed that ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in these physiological parameters. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. The study highlights the utility of mice as a good model to study many of tamoxifen's physiological effects and provides a framework for understanding the undesirable side effects of tamoxifen therapy in humans.
ISG15, a linear di-ubiquitin-like protein with anti-viral activity, is induced in nonphagocytic cells in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection. This induction occurs independently of type I interferon and is mediated by the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. The study reveals that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. Using stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC), the researchers identified ISGylated proteins responsible for the protective effect of ISG15. The results show that ISG15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins increases the secretion of cytokines that counteract infection in vivo. The study demonstrates that ISG15 can be induced by Listeria in an interferon-independent manner in human nonphagocytic cells. The ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection reinforces the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response. ISG15's role in host defense against Listeria in vitro requires ISGylation, a process in which ISG15 is covalently linked to hundreds of cellular and viral substrates. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection and highlights the importance of ISG15 in the innate immune response. The findings suggest that ISG15 could be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Listeria infections.
Title: DeepFRET, a software for rapid and automated single-molecule FRET data classification using deep learning

Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a versatile method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the growth of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated analysis methods for smFRET data. To address this gap, researchers have developed DeepFRET, an automated, open-source software based on deep learning. DeepFRET integrates standard features of smFRET analysis and outputs common kinetic information metrics.

The software operates with minimal human intervention, requiring only a user-adjustable quality threshold to transition from raw microscope images to histograms of biomolecule behavior. DeepFRET's classification accuracy on ground truth data exceeded 95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used thresholds, while requiring approximately 1% of the time. The software's precise and rapid operation on real data demonstrates its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics.

DeepFRET's neural network was trained using either simulated or high-quality annotated experimental data, enabling it to recognize abstract patterns and learn useful features directly from raw input data. This approach offers several advantages over other methods, including reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data, faster processing times, and the ability to operate without extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules.

The software's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which quantified the discordance between ground truth data and data selected and classified by DeepFRET. The results illustrate the power of DeepFRET to operate without human interventions and its potential to benchmark the reproducibility of smFRET data acquisition methods for multiple biomolecular systems across laboratories.

DeepFRET is an all-inclusive analysis software with a pre-trained DNN at its core, providing a rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smFRET data for quantifying biomolecular dynamics. The software comes as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users, allowing end-users with limited programming skills to easily operate it. DeepFRET has the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology and enable new fully automated analysis methodologies related to biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and dynamics.
The Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, is a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1. This study reveals that SCML2A, an isoform of SCML2 tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). The targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes, and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations suggest a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and indicate that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1. Furthermore, SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly at a subset of genes, independent of PRC1 recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets sheds new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation. The study also reveals that RNA binding plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin. The results support a model in which the RBR contributes to the localization of SCML2A to chromatin, where it interacts with PRC1 and creates a chromatin environment that is refractory to transcription. The study proposes that SCML2A is retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and contributes to stabilizing PRC1. The findings suggest that SCML2 is recruited to a subset of target genes through a process that requires its RNA-binding activity and that the presence of mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes a partial release of BMI1 and PRC1 from chromatin.
The regulation of translating ribosomes is a crucial component of the gene expression control network in Escherichia coli. The C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway by inducing ribosome stalling. Previous studies have identified critical residues of SecM peptide and the ribosome exit tunnel involved in stalling, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear at the atomic level. This study presents two cryo-EM structures of SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3. 3–3. 7 Å resolution, revealing two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves the inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center ( PTC ), which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA. The second mechanism involves the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which prevents full-scale tRNA translocation. These findings demonstrate an elegant control of the translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome. The study used an in vitro translation system from E. coli to purify SecM-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes ( RNCs ) and analyzed their structures using single-particle cryo-EM. The analysis of ribosome–SecM interactions at near-atomic level reveals two different mechanisms of stalling and provides detailed insights into how SecM nascent peptide modulates translation in distinct steps. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling and sheds light on the complex interactions between SecM and the ribosome.
Title: Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length

    A recent study used an Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to investigate the relationship between foveal cone density and eye length in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in both visual angle and linear retinal units. The results show that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. This suggests that myopes may have better visual acuity due to a higher photoreceptor sampling resolution.

    Previous studies have implicated retinal stretching as a possible cause of myopic visual deficits, but the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression were not well understood. The current study aimed to investigate how eye length affects cone density at and near the foveal center. Two types of cone densities were discussed in the study: cone density per unit area and cone density per unit visual angle. The results show that myopes have a higher cone density per unit visual angle compared to emmetropes, indicating a higher photoreceptor sampling resolution.

    The study used a new generation of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea. This technology allows for high-resolution imaging of the smallest cones at the foveal center, enabling a definitive analysis of cone density as a function of eye length. The study found that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. This means that myopes have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, despite retinal stretching.

    The study's findings have implications for our understanding of myopic visual deficits. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression. Instead, the study suggests that myopes may have better visual acuity due to a higher photoreceptor sampling resolution. The results of this study provide new insights into the relationship between foveal cone density and eye length, and highlight the importance of considering the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression.
Title: Genome-wide Identification of Lineage and Locus Specific Variation Associated with Pneumococcal Carriage Duration

    A recent study investigated the genetic factors contributing to the duration of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage in the nasopharynx, a prerequisite for invasive disease, particularly in low-income settings. The researchers developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. The analysis revealed that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation in carriage duration, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The study further partitioned this heritability into lineage and locus effects, identifying serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other significant locus effects (7%) as the largest sources of variation in carriage duration.

    A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration, independent of serotype, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism. This finding supports theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. The study's analysis of heritability showed that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work. The researchers also identified candidates for the loci that fulfill this role, suggesting that variants exist in the pneumococcal genome that alter carriage duration, which is linked to antibiotic resistance.

    The study found that despite other factors such as host age, sequence variation of the pneumococcal genome explains most of the variability in carriage duration. Common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin cause some of this effect, as does the presence or absence of particular prophage sequences in the genome. The researchers provide a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration and show evidence for differences both between and within serotypes. The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes in this dataset.

    The study's findings suggest that the genetics of S. pneumoniae is an important factor in determining carriage duration in this population. The heritability estimate may differ if environmental conditions are associated with streptococcal genotype between populations, such as host vaccination status. A lower bound on h2 can be calculated by fitting a linear mixed model through maximum likelihood to common SNPs.
The stoichiometry between the α-subunit KCNQ1 and the β-subunit KCNE1 of the slow delayed rectifier current (IKs) channel complex has been a topic of controversy in the scientific community. The IKs channel complex plays a crucial role in stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates in the myocardium. To clarify the stoichiometry, researchers created fusion channels where KCNE1 was linked to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits, resulting in 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries, respectively. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed that the 2:4 and 1:4 stoichiometries exhibited increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to the 4:4 stoichiometry. However, the addition of KCNE1 abolished these differences, indicating that the observed effects were due to the stoichiometry of the fusion channels rather than an intrinsic property of KCNE1.

    To further investigate the stoichiometry, the researchers used a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approach to study the association between KCNE1 and KCNQ1 subunits. The results showed that the crosslinking rates of the 2:4 and 1:4 stoichiometries were progressively slowed compared to the 4:4 stoichiometry, suggesting that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. This finding supports the idea that the stoichiometry between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 can be regulated based on availability, allowing for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

    The IKs channel complex is composed of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits, which are expressed in various tissues, including the myocardium and inner ear. In the heart, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 together conduct the slow delayed rectifier current (IKs), which is primarily responsible for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates. However, the stoichiometry between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 has been a subject of debate, with some studies reporting a strict 2:4 ratio and others suggesting a variable ratio up to 4:4. The results of this study provide new insights into the stoichiometry of the IKs channel complex and highlight the importance of regulating the expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits to modulate repolarization in the heart.
In a study on zebrafish fin fold regeneration, researchers have elucidated the role of interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. The study found that Il1b, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is expressed by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury and plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of regeneration-induced genes. However, prolonged expression of Il1b leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells, highlighting the double-edged sword nature of Il1b signaling in tissue regeneration.

The study revealed that myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, are not the primary source of Il1b, but rather epithelial cells initiate the inflammatory response by expressing Il1b in response to tissue injury. Macrophages then play a critical role in attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation, which is necessary for the survival of regenerative cells. The study also showed that genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish affects fin ray patterning and fin growth, further emphasizing the importance of macrophages in tissue regeneration.

The researchers demonstrated that Il1b signaling is essential for normal fin fold regeneration by activating the expression of regeneration-induced genes. However, excessive Il1b signaling and inflammation can impair tissue regeneration, leading to apoptosis of regenerative cells. The study suggests that a proper level of Il1b expression and the inflammatory response, tuned by macrophages, is necessary for the progression of tissue regeneration.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex interplay between Il1b signaling, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. The study highlights the critical role of macrophages in attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation, which is necessary for the survival of regenerative cells. The results also emphasize the importance of a balanced inflammatory response in tissue regeneration, as excessive inflammation can lead to apoptosis of regenerative cells. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration and has implications for the development of regenerative therapies.
The study investigated the relationship between protein surface properties and translational diffusion in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. The researchers used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine their translational diffusion coefficients (D) in the cytoplasm of these organisms. The results show that the diffusion coefficient of proteins in E. coli depends on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is primarily caused by the interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes, as demonstrated by in vivo diffusion measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. The study suggests that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. The findings also indicate that positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but may also inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes. Furthermore, the study analyzed the proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis, Hfx. volcanii, and four endosymbiotic bacteria to determine how protein diffusion is affected by the composition of the proteome and how ribosomes influence the diffusion of proteome constituents. The results have implications for understanding the functioning of prokaryotic endosymbionts and the importance of translational diffusion in biological cells.
Biologists have long sought to understand the mechanisms that initiate regeneration in animals. Planarians, a type of flatworm, are capable of whole-body regeneration and exhibit distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence versus those that do not. A key question has been how these distinct responses are activated. Researchers have identified a gene called Smed-follistatin, a homolog of the protein follistatin, which is required for planarian regeneration. Smed-follistatin inhibits the activity of two activin homologs, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, which are necessary for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. The study found that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. This suggests that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence. The data indicate that Smed-follistatin plays a critical role in initiating regeneration, a process important across the animal kingdom. The study also found that Smed-follistatin expression is controlled by the extent of tissue absence following injury, and that inhibition of Smed-follistatin blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Furthermore, the study suggests that wound-induced Smed-follistatin expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence. This is the first time a gene has been identified as required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of regeneration and have implications for understanding how animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate distinct wound response programs.
Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors exhibit a unique mutation signature characterized by a high frequency of indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats, also known as microsatellite instability (MSI). This mutation signature is distinct from other tumor genomes but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, suggesting that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises from mutations that escape MMR. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors revealed a 52-fold increase in somatic events compared to MMR-proficient tumors, with a validation rate of 87% for substitutions and 86% for indels.

The study identified a large set of recurrent indels that may serve as markers for MSI detection. Using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, a novel marker set was optimized to detect MSI, which showed greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. The marker set was capable of detecting MSI in 75% of endometrial and colorectal cancer tumors.

Furthermore, the study found that recurrent indels are enriched for the "DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination" pathway. Consequently, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, leading to a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers. This suggests that MMR-deficient tumors may be more susceptible to therapies that induce DNA double-strand breaks.

The results of this study have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of MMR-deficient tumors. The identification of a unique mutation signature and the development of a novel marker set for MSI detection may enable more accurate diagnosis and prognosis of MMR-deficient tumors. Additionally, the finding that MMR-deficient tumors are sensitive to DSB inducers may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these tumors.
The article describes the development of an optimized version of the Magnets photodimerizer system for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells. The Magnets system is a light-inducible dimerization module engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid, which enables precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. The original Magnets system consists of two components, nMag and pMag, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners and require simultaneous photoactivation to interact, allowing for high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, the original Magnets system requires concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28°C to be functional.

    To overcome these limitations, the authors engineered an optimized Magnets pair, referred to as ‘enhanced’ Magnets (eMags), which do not require concatemerization or low-temperature preincubation. The eMags were designed by introducing complementary charges into the Vivid homodimer interface, resulting in a pair with greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. The eMags were validated by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organelle contacts, and reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering, which is implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism.

    The eMags were shown to be effective in a variety of applications, including protein recruitment to different organelles, the generation/expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers. The eMags offer major advantages over other optogenetic systems, including rapid association and dissociation kinetics, low background activation, and the ability to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes. Overall, the eMags represent a highly effective tool for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes in mammalian cells.
Activation of GCN2 Kinase by Ribosome Stalling Links Translation Elongation with Translation Initiation

    Recent studies have shown that ribosome stalling during translation can lead to neurodegeneration, but the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes were unknown. To investigate these pathways, researchers analyzed the brains of C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor.

    The results showed that increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice, and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments revealed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Furthermore, the ISR was found to attenuate neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway.

    The study demonstrated that GCN2 is activated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutant brain in a tRNA-deacyl-independent manner prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. Genetic studies showed that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain, suggesting that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.

    Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration of these cells, but the signaling pathways evoked by these complexes were unknown. The study shows that GCN2 activates the integrated stress response in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating an important feedback loop between elongation defects, in particular ribosome stalling, and translation initiation. Furthermore, in the hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice, degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells was observed, suggesting that the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for survival of these neurons during ribosome stalling. Finally, ATF4 activation also occurs in the brains of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which the n-Tr20 is entirely deleted and thus no unprocessed tRNA is produced, raising the possibility that ribosome stalling may also contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation. The exact mechanism for GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear.
Over the past century, adult human height has undergone significant and uneven changes across the world’s countries. A comprehensive analysis of 1472 population-based studies involving over 18.6 million participants revealed that the largest gains in adult height have occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who have become 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively, since the 1896 birth cohort. In contrast, there has been little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and South Asia over the past century.

    The tallest populations a century ago were found in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and some Pacific islands, with men born in Sweden, Norway, and the USA surpassing 171 cm, approximately 18-19 cm taller than men in Laos. Swedish women, with an average adult height of 160.3 cm, were also among the tallest. Conversely, women born in Guatemala in 1896 were the shortest, with an average height of 140.3 cm.

    The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and has remained relatively stable for women but increased for men over the past century, despite changes in the ranking of countries by adult height. Men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century were found to be the tallest, with an average height of 182.5 cm. The gap between the tallest and shortest countries has also increased, with Dutch men being 22-23 cm taller than men in Timor-Leste, Yemen, and Laos, which are among the shortest countries.

    Notably, the largest gains in adult height since the 1896 birth cohort were observed in South Korean women and Iranian men, who experienced increases of 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm, respectively. In contrast, some sub-Saharan African countries and South Asia have seen little change in adult height over the past century. The tallest populations a century ago were found in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and some Pacific islands, while the shortest populations were found in Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations has remained relatively stable for women but increased for men over the past century.
The opioid epidemic in the United States has resulted in a staggering 130 deaths per day due to opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). To combat this crisis, researchers have been working to identify the key brain areas and cell types responsible for OIRD. A recent study has made significant progress in this area by uncovering two primary sites in the brainstem that mediate the effects of opioids on breathing. The study found that the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a region responsible for generating the breathing rhythm, is a critical site for opioid-induced respiratory depression. Specifically, the researchers discovered that approximately 140 Oprm1 glutamatergic neurons in the preBötC are responsible for this effect. Furthermore, they found that just 70-140 of these neurons are sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preBötC rhythm.

    The study used genetic tools to selectively eliminate the µ-Opioid receptor in the preBötC and found that this significantly reduced the depressive effects of opioids on breathing. The researchers also identified a second site in the brainstem that contributes to OIRD, although this site is less dominant than the preBötC. The combined deletion of the µ-Opioid receptor from both sites essentially eliminated OIRD, even at high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl. This suggests that targeting just these two sites is sufficient to rescue opioid respiratory depression.

    The study's findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapies that can prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia. The researchers propose that targeting the Oprm1 neurons in the preBötC could lead to the development of safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose. The study's results also highlight the importance of understanding the neural mechanisms underlying OIRD in order to develop effective treatments for this devastating public health crisis.
Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D virus (HDV), are significant public health concerns due to their severe disease outcomes in coinfected individuals. The entry of both viruses into hepatocytes is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein. However, the identity of the receptor(s) responsible for binding to this domain has remained unknown. To address this knowledge gap, researchers employed near-zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification to investigate the interaction between the pre-S1 domain and potential receptors. The results revealed that sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver, specifically interacts with the pre-S1 domain of the HBV and HDV large envelope proteins. This interaction is crucial for the entry of both viruses into hepatocytes. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Furthermore, replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart restored the ability of NTCP to support HBV and HDV infections. These findings demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor binding, and the region between amino acids 157 and 165 of NTCP is crucial for binding to the pre-S1 domain of the HBV and HDV large envelope proteins. The identification of NTCP as a receptor for HBV and HDV provides new insights into the mechanisms of viral entry and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HBV and HDV infections.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in long-term immunity. The study found that memory CD8 T cells from septic patients and mice proliferate more than those from healthy individuals, leading to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. This increased proliferation is associated with a numerical recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells following sepsis-induced lymphopenia, a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of immune cells in the body.

    The study used a mouse model of sepsis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ), to investigate the effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells. The results showed that central memory CD8 T cells ( TCM ) from septic mice proliferate more than effector memory CD8 T cells ( TEM ), leading to an over-representation of TCM in the memory CD8 T cell pool after sepsis. This bias toward TCM alters the localization of memory CD8 T cells, potentially affecting their ability to respond to infections.

    The study also found that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. These changes in the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape result in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control Listeria monocytogenes infection. The study suggests that sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection.

    The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the long-term effects of sepsis on the immune system. Sepsis survivors may be more susceptible to re-infection due to the lasting changes in their memory CD8 T cells. The study highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying these changes and the development of strategies to restore immune function in sepsis survivors.
APOBEC3A (A3A) is a potent inhibitor of Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition in human cells. L1 retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to the human genome, and A3A has been shown to inhibit this process in cultured cell assays. However, the molecular mechanism by which A3A exerts its inhibitory effect has remained unclear. A3A is a cytidine deaminase that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-to-U) in single-strand DNA substrates.

    To elucidate the mechanism of A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition, researchers employed an in vitro assay (L1 Element Amplification Protocol or LEAP) that recapitulates the first strand cDNA synthesis step of the L1 integration process. This assay revealed that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. Furthermore, engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (UGI) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events.

    Previous studies have shown that over-expression of wild-type (WT) APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase protein (A3A) can potently inhibit L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells. However, deamination events were not detected in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of WT A3A. The degradation of deaminated retrotransposition intermediates could reduce L1 retrotransposition levels in cultured cell assays and eliminate evidence of A3A-mediated deamination events in the resultant retrotransposed L1 sequences. This scenario could explain why previous studies failed to detect A3A-mediated deamination events in engineered L1 retrotransposition events.

    The results of this study demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the inhibitory effect of A3A on L1 retrotransposition and highlights the importance of A3A in regulating L1 retrotransposition in human cells.
The study investigated the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity. Rem2 is a member of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir ( RGK ) protein family, whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. The researchers found that Rem2-/- mice failed to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period, indicating a role for Rem2 in experience-dependent plasticity. At the cellular level, the study established a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. These findings suggest that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience. Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. The study also found that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience and plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation. The results raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. The study provides an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function and highlights the need to define Rem2-dependent signaling mechanisms to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuitry.
The article presents an analysis of the physical limits to magnetogenetics, a field that aims to engineer cells to be responsive to magnetic fields for controlling their activity. Recent studies have reported promising results, including the identification of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals and the magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein. However, the article argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, as the forces or torques produced by magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells are too small by many orders of magnitude to achieve the desired effects. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes, such as ferritin, is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The article suggests that if the reported phenomena do occur, they must rely on entirely different mechanisms. The proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success without dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter. A recent study reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane by fusing a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel (TRPV4) to two subunits of ferritin. Experimental results suggested that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields, but the evidence is limited and hard to interpret. The article concludes that the underlying biophysical mechanism of magnetogenetics remains unresolved and that further research is needed to understand how organisms sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation and how to engineer cells to be responsive to magnetic fields.
In a study on Drosophila neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts, researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying quiescence, a state of dormancy that stem cells can enter to conserve energy and resources. Quiescence is a crucial aspect of stem cell biology, particularly for stem cell-based therapeutics, but it remains poorly understood. The study found that the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence. This pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero precedes the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers. The researchers observed that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, while a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. Furthermore, the study showed that nearly all neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hours after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers 24 hours later. The researchers also found that precocious low-level nuclear Prospero can advance the timing of neuroblast quiescence. These findings suggest that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. The study proposes that a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry into quiescence, indicating a functional relationship between Prospero and quiescence. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of quiescence in Drosophila neural progenitors and highlights the importance of Prospero in regulating stem cell fate decisions.
Scientists have developed a new method to study the process of HIV-1 capsid uncoating in real-time using single-particle fluorescence microscopy. This technique allows researchers to observe the disassembly of individual HIV capsids immediately after the viral membrane is permeabilized. The study reveals that the opening of the first defect in the capsid lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, which is followed by a rapid and catastrophic collapse. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates the opening of the capsid but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays the initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. These findings suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, and the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators determines the overall uncoating kinetics.

    The researchers used an in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay to follow the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment. This approach allows for the resolution of intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are averaged out in traditional ensemble assays. The study found that the integrity and stability of capsids in a population are highly heterogeneous, with the majority containing defects and/or uncoating immediately after removal of the viral membrane. In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. The half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level.

    The study demonstrates that capsid-binding molecules exhibit differential effects on the steps that control initiation and continuation of uncoating. The structural heterogeneity of the HIV capsid is well described, with the assembly process yielding a variety of conical, tubular, and other shapes that often contain structural defects such as gaps in the CA lattice. By observing the properties of many individual capsids, it is possible to classify them according to their uncoating behaviors. The findings of this study provide new insights into the intrinsic capsid disassembly pathway and how it can be modulated by different capsid-binding regulators.
The cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer. Contrary to the expectation that JNK signaling promotes cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor, loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway are frequently observed in breast cancer genomic DNA. To investigate the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development, researchers examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium. The results showed that loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency led to widespread early neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. These findings suggest that JNK pathway defects are "driver" mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation.

The study found that JNK deficiency in mammary epithelial cells caused breast cancer, and accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. The effects of JNK deficiency were associated with widespread presence of early neoplasia and genomic instability. The researchers demonstrated that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development. The frequent JNK pathway loss-of-function mutations in human breast cancer may represent "driver" mutations that promote tumor development.

In contrast to the expected role of JNK signaling in promoting tumor growth, the study found that JNK loss plays a key role at the early stages of breast cancer development by promoting mammary gland neoplasia. This observation likely accounts for the effect of mutational inactivation of JNK signaling to promote tumor development. The JNK signaling pathway may be suppressed in many breast cancers, and the association of breast cancer with reduced JNK signaling represents a correlation. The study aimed to test the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development and found that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer, and rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. The major conclusions of this study are that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer, and JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer.
A bioactive peptide amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), has been identified as a crucial factor in the assembly of cilia in various cell types. Cilia are microtubule-based structures that protrude from the surface of eukaryotic cells and play essential roles in sensory perception, motility, and signaling. PAM is responsible for generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, and its activity has been linked to ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice.

    In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, resulting in abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Similarly, decreased PAM gene expression in planaria reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, PAM deficiency led to aberrant architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in embryos.

    The study suggests that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to ciliogenesis defects. PAM is required for the biogenesis of motile cilia in Chlamydomonas and on the ventral epithelium of planaria, as well as the normal assembly of primary cilia of neuroepithelial cells in mammals. The findings indicate a novel and highly conserved link between PAM, amidation, and ciliary assembly in multiple cell types.

    The results demonstrate that PAM plays a key role in the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a previously unknown connection between amidation and cilium assembly. The study also highlights the importance of PAM in the trafficking of signaling proteins to the ciliary compartment from the Golgi apparatus. While PAM is essential for ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas and planaria, its complete loss in mice does not abolish primary cilia formation in neuroepithelial cells, although the cilia are significantly shorter than those in wild-type animals.

    Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ciliogenesis and highlights the importance of PAM in the assembly of cilia in various cell types. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of cilia in eukaryotic cells.
The interaction between class III myosins (Myo3) and the actin-bundling protein Espin plays a crucial role in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Stereocilia defects caused by mutations in Myo3 or Espin lead to hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), but the mechanism by which Myo3 acts through Espin1 to regulate actin bundle assembly and stabilization was unclear. This study reveals that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, providing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition. Furthermore, Myo3-mediated cross-linking promotes actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. The authors propose that Myo3 binding can release auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles. Myo3a and Myo3b co-localize with Espin1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells, and co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 stimulates elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells. The study suggests that a key function of the Myo3/Espin1 interaction is to promote the formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. The Myo3/Espin1 interaction is mediated by the THDI, which allows Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures. Once localized, Espin1 promotes the elongation of actin protrusions. The study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. Both Myo3a and Myo3b contain two highly similar repeat sequences in their THDI region, each capable of independently binding to Espin1-AR with high affinity. The full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work.
Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) play a crucial role in controlling various cellular functions, including synaptic transmission in neurons and muscle contraction in heart and skeletal muscles. These channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics to accomplish their diverse functions. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage-sensing properties, researchers combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1.

The study found that both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model, but differed significantly in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

Voltage-gated calcium channels translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx, contributing to cellular excitability and coupling electrical activity to fundamental cell functions. They form a structurally related ion channel superfamily with a fourfold symmetry with voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV). The study's advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1.1 VSDs fill an important gap in the understanding of the voltage-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels.

The researchers used the Rosetta computational modeling software to build a homology model of the human eukaryotic CaV1.1 channel and generated a new structural model to study the molecular mechanisms determining the specific gating properties of this voltage-gated calcium channel. The study's findings were supported by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis, which showed that alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by the computer model. The structures of the lowest energy states of CaV1.1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model, providing a mechanistic understanding of how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.
The study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult visual plasticity in the healthy and stroke-affected brain. MMPs have been associated with experience-dependent plasticity in the juvenile brain, but their role in the adult brain is not well understood. The researchers examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice. They found that a 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals. However, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur. The study highlights the importance of precise regulation of MMP-activity for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke. The results also indicate that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. The study expands on previous research, which has shown that MMPs play a vital role in adult visual cortex plasticity, particularly for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after monocular deprivation. The findings have implications for understanding the complex role of MMPs in brain development and function, particularly in the context of brain injury and recovery. The study suggests that MMP-inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for rescuing lost plasticity after stroke, but further research is needed to fully explore this possibility. Overall, the study provides new insights into the critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and highlights the importance of precise regulation of MMP-activity for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain.
Biomedical research has made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, which are crucial for signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses. AMPA receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of four subunits that assemble as a dimer-of-dimers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have enabled the determination of full-length structures of AMPA receptors, both alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures suggest that the dimers may undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, resulting in the opening of the extracellular layer along the central twofold symmetry axis.

    To investigate the conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors, researchers used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. The results indicate that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can become trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors are likely to remain compact during gating.

    The study suggests that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead operate in a relatively compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin, appears to play a crucial role in maintaining the compact conformation of AMPA receptors during synaptic transmission. The findings of this study provide new insights into the structural dynamics of AMPA receptors and highlight the importance of auxiliary subunits in regulating their conformational flexibility.
Title: High-Dimensional Analysis of Intestinal Immune Cells during Helminth Infection

    A novel protocol for isolating immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with helminths has been developed, overcoming the challenges posed by the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune response. This response is characterized by mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration, making it difficult to obtain a representative sample of intestinal immune cells. By optimizing a standard intestinal digestion protocol, the researchers were able to isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum.

    To validate the accuracy of the isolated cells, a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel was used to analyze the cells, incorporating hallmark surface and intracellular markers associated with helminth infections. The results confirmed the presence of known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. The findings were further validated using confocal microscopy, which revealed differences in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples.

    The study highlights the importance of good cell isolation techniques for investigating intestinal responses against helminths directly. Many of the observed changes were localized, emphasizing the need for precise cell isolation methods to accurately capture intestinal immune responses. The protocol developed in this study has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that were previously unfeasible.

    The researchers characterized the isolated cells further by quantifying specific immune cell populations, including B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4-, and CD64+ cells, using both spectral flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The results showed that the cell isolation protocol provided an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, allowing for the identification of many known hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses throughout the course of helminth infection.
The article presents a quantitative time-resolved analysis of the regulation of standard- and immuno-proteasomes, which are key determinants of protein half-life and cellular processes. Despite their importance, the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are not fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, the authors developed and validated a mechanistic model of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics using an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and computational approach. The model predicts the locations of proteolytic and regulatory sites on the 20S proteasome and the interactions between them, which are supported by experimental data. The analysis reveals that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of substrates into the proteasome, and that the transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes, affecting total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage.

    The study combines carefully designed experimental assays with detailed modelling to shed light on the mechanisms of proteasome functions. The authors use short fluorogenic peptides with a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site to follow the kinetics in real-time, providing direct insights into proteasome dynamics. The results show similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome and protein homogenates, suggesting that the model describes a core of proteasome features that can reflect proteasome dynamics in more complex cellular environments.

    The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme, and its catalytic activity varies over time due to interactions between substrates and products with proteolytic and regulatory sites. The kinetics change over longer time scales than previously described structural dynamics, and are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites. The analysis highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of proteasomal action, particularly the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms. The study provides a comprehensive mathematical model that describes the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides.
The β-alanine transporter BalaT plays a crucial role in visual neurotransmission in Drosophila. The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission, and in Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia and converted to carcinine, which is then delivered back to photoreceptors where it is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. However, it was unclear how β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells. A new β-alanine transporter, BalaT, was identified and found to be expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine and less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. The results suggest that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission and that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission. BalaT functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle β-alanine, which is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Disrupting the synthesis of histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission, and the transport of β-alanine seems less important as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila. The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila compound eye. High levels of β-alanine are detected in retinal pigment cells, suggesting that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine in this system. Mutations in balat disrupted transport and storage of β-alanine in the retina, resulting in dramatically reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior. This suggests a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila, and provides evidence for the formulation of a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission.
The article reports on the discovery of a sudden redox collapse in chronologically aging yeast cells, which affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This collapse occurs several days prior to cell death and is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, contrary to the free radical theory of aging. Instead, it appears to be instigated by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH levels, which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that down-regulates most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The study reveals a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death. The results suggest that chronological aging might represent a physiological stress condition that utilizes and stresses the redox buffering capacity of the thiol proteome. The study used chronologically aging Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in postmitotic aging cells. By monitoring the thiol oxidation status of almost 300 different protein thiols, the researchers discovered that yeast cells undergo a global redox collapse that leads to massive thiol oxidation in almost 80% of identified proteins several days prior to cell death. The findings indicate that the observed decrease in cellular NADPH levels and the concomitant increase in cellular redox potential is not just a yeast-specific event but might be shared with other aging organisms as their metabolism changes. The study also found that yeast cells undergo the same pattern of NADPH decrease, Trr1 oxidation, and redox collapse when cultivated in 2% glucose or in 0. 5% glucose, suggesting that the redox collapse is a general feature of aging in postmitotic cells.
The study presents the mechanistic basis of D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), a configuration-specific enzyme responsible for selectively removing D-amino acids that are erroneously coupled to transfer RNAs (tRNAs). This process is crucial for maintaining the homochirality of the biological macromolecular world, which is essential for cell survival. The researchers determined the crystal structure of DTD from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog, revealing how the enzyme captures the chiral center of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA using an invariant Gly-cisPro dipeptide. This dipeptide is located in the active site of the dimeric enzyme and plays a central role in the recognition mechanism. The structure shows that no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, but rather, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition allows DTD to act on multiple D-amino acids. This mechanism provides a clear explanation for the enzyme's ability to selectively remove D-amino acids from tRNAs. The study also highlights the importance of weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection, as an L-amino acid would have to bind in one of three theoretically possible conformations to be recognized by the enzyme. The findings provide insights into a fundamental enantioselective mechanism involved in the enforcement of homochirality in proteins and elucidate a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of the translational apparatus. The study builds upon earlier structural studies on DTD, which provided a mechanistic model based on docking approaches or complex structures with ligands that do not mimic the cognate substrate. The results suggest that DTD acts in trans as a freestanding module, recapturing aminoacyl-tRNAs from elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) to remove D-amino acids from tRNAs. Overall, the study provides a detailed understanding of the mechanism of chiral proofreading during translation of the genetic code.
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion channel that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP following phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory (R) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Recent studies have shown that ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) opens the pore, while dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. However, in certain cystic fibrosis (CF) mutants, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR but constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator.

    Researchers have investigated the molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating in CFTR channels. By correlating energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels, they found that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. This suggests that coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations.

    The study also explored the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening. The results indicate that ATP acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state, rather than altering the global arrangement of conformations. This understanding provides insights into the correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity.

    The findings have significant implications for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms. The strict coupling between NBD and pore movements, regardless of the absence or presence of ATP, constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating and helps explain modulatory effects of mutations, or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins.
The article presents a novel mechanism for the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, which is mediated by a pre-transition effect. This effect arises from the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulations, the authors demonstrate that a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite, and when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble due to the reduction in net interfacial energy. This phenomenon is analogous to the hydrophobic effect and is referred to as the "orderphobic effect." The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered. The orderphobic effect leverages the power of a phase transition, depending on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability depends on the proximity to the membrane's phase transition and the protein's radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane. For instance, a transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic thickness of approximately 2.6 nm will favor the structure of the disordered phase. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order-disorder interface. The prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques. Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are more complicated than the models considered in this paper, with multiple components allowing for more than one order-disorder transition. A dual to the orderphobic effect also exists, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-disorder interface. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly. A consequence of the regular tail packing is that the hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase is larger than that of the disordered phase. The area per lipid in the ordered phase is smaller than that in the disordered phase.
The relationship between simultaneously recorded spiking activity and fluorescence signals in GCaMP6 transgenic mice was investigated in a recent study. Fluorescent calcium indicators are commonly used to examine neural dynamics, but the connection between fluorescence and action potentials ( APs ) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope’s field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, which generates fewer photons per neuron and compromises AP detection. The study characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. Under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected ( often <10% and ~20–30%, respectively ), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions. The study highlights the challenges of inferring the underlying AP train or firing rate from calcium imaging due to population imaging studies employing a large field of view containing many neurons. The AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function is typically characterized with a soma filling the field of view of the microscope, to maximize photon flux from the soma and thereby signal-to-noise ratio. To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, isolated AP events were identified and summed over 250 ms. The results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets. The study facilitates the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset. Previous studies have established that most APs can be detected with GCaMP6 indicators under near-optimal conditions. The study tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal conditions and under the less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments. The results will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets. Genetically encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs ) are widely used with two-photon laser scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo. This optical approach is minimally invasive and enables simultaneous measurement of activity from hundreds or even thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution, over multiple sessions.
In the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla, a unique biological switching valve has been discovered within the female genitalia. This valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals, allowing females to control the direction of seminal flow. The female Neotrogla possesses a penis-like intromittent organ, which is used to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packaged in a capsule that is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as a source of nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, enabling females to receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. This mechanism allows females to selectively use one slot for insemination while leaving the other empty, enabling them to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function further refines our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla, allowing females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The male-holding organ and female-induced long copulation durations of 40–70 hours in Neotrogla are considered exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats. The discovery of this biological switching valve highlights the complexity and diversity of reproductive strategies in insects and provides new insights into the evolution of sex-role reversal in the genus Neotrogla.
Munc18-1 plays a crucial role in regulating the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins, which are essential for the rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters at synapses. The study used optical tweezers to observe four distinct stages of SNARE assembly, including the N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). The researchers found that mutations in different SNARE layers differentially affect SNARE assembly and exocytosis, with the NTD and CTD responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, and the MD regulating SNARE assembly and fusion.

The study also investigated the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly and found that it initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independently of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD). Munc18-1 stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent on the NRD. The researchers used optical tweezers to observe the forces associated with Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly and found that Munc18-1 enhances de novo SNARE assembly by holding the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as the t-SNARE unfolds.

The study identified three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with previous reports of multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex. The researchers propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. According to this model, Munc18-1 acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly. The study suggests that Munc18-1 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly, from initiation to stabilization of the half-zippered SNARE complex. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of synaptic exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in regulating SNARE assembly and membrane fusion.
The integrin adhesome, a complex of proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion, has been found to be extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), researchers investigated the dynamic exchange of these building blocks between adhesion sites and the cytosol. The results show that stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, maintaining the cytosolic pool of building blocks in a spatiotemporally uniform state.

The study reveals that the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks, which can facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The physical associations between adhesion site components are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating that these sites exchange their building blocks with the cytosol without altering them. In the cytosol, the building blocks cannot form larger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions.

The researchers propose that at the plasma membrane, the system can be locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome. This model suggests that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks for cell-matrix adhesion sites. The building blocks are size-confined and predominantly correspond to the functional layers across focal adhesions, including anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation.

Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol ensures that building blocks enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered, maintaining the assembly logic of the system. This process prevents the self-assembly process from losing control on the identity of co-recruited proteins, which would lead to the formation of aberrant structures. The study highlights the importance of integrating interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome to understand the assembly logic of adhesion sites.
Title: An Electrophysiological Marker of Arousal Level in Humans

    Summary
    A recent study has identified a common electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. The marker, known as the 1/f spectral slope, is a measure of the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity in the brain. The researchers used intracranial and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope can distinguish between wakefulness and reduced arousal states, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol.

    The study built on previous research that showed that the 1/f spectral slope can track arousal states in humans under anesthesia with propofol and during sleep. The researchers hypothesized that the spectral slope would become more negative (i.e., the power spectrum steeper) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. They also predicted that the spectral slope could discriminate wakefulness from NREM and REM sleep.

    The study analyzed two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep and found that the 1/f spectral slope can discern wakefulness from different sleep stages, including REM and NREM sleep. The researchers also demonstrated that the spectral slope mirrored the rapid changes in excitability observed over the course of a slow wave, providing a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations.

    The study's findings provide empirical evidence that the 1/f spectral slope in the 30-45 Hz frequency range reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol. The 1/f dynamics are observed across a variety of tasks, and the spectral slope tracks changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-second epochs to full night recordings.

    The study's results from four independent studies provide five main advances: (1) the spectral slope tracks changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales; (2) the results provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal; (3) the spectral slope can discriminate wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state; (4) the 1/f spectral slope is a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages and anesthesia in humans; and (5) the spectral slope provides a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations.
Biomedical research has revealed that stromules, dynamic tubular extensions from chloroplasts, play a crucial role in innate immunity. Recent studies have shown that stromules connect with nuclei and are involved in various cellular processes. This study investigated the mechanism of stromule extension and movement in chloroplasts of green leaf tissue and perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity. The results demonstrate that microtubules (MTs) are essential for stromule extension and movement. MT depolymerization led to stromule retraction, while MT stabilization increased stromule frequency and length. In contrast, actin filaments (AFs) are not required for stromule extension but provide anchor points for stromules. Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement. Stromule-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting it is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells. The study proposes a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity. Furthermore, the results show that MTs and AFs may facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an innate immune response. The findings provide mechanistic insights into how interactions with the cytoskeleton form and stabilize stromules, and reveal a new type of organellar movement along MTs that is stromule-directed. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of stromules in innate immunity and highlights the importance of cytoskeletal elements in plant cells. The results suggest that MT-mediated stromule extension and AF-mediated stromule anchoring are two complementary activities during stromule formation and movement. Future studies will investigate the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and stromule-directed movement, as well as the importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity.
The article presents a method for predicting residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. The authors investigate whether amino acid sequence identities of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution, which could be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. Using a pseudo-likelihood-based method, the authors find that residue pairs identified as covarying across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. This suggests that interactions can be accurately predicted across protein–protein interfaces given a sufficient number of aligned sequences. The authors apply this method to 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure and present structure models for four of the complexes, including the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic ( TRAP ) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter. The results indicate that covarying pairs of positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. Furthermore, the authors find that significant residue–residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs, suggesting that this method can be used to predict whether two proteins interact. The authors conclude that this method has the potential to contribute to the determination of the structures of biologically important complexes.
In a study on active sensing in visual pattern categorization, researchers employed a novel gaze-contingent paradigm to investigate how participants accumulate information from multiple locations in a scene. The results showed that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. This strategy was found to be more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy. Furthermore, the study estimated that a major portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The central process of selecting fixation locations was found to be around 70% efficient in the task. By using a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and an active sensor algorithm, the researchers were able to dissociate the contributions of the eye-movement selection process from those of perceptual, motor, and decision processes. This allowed them to identify predominant sources of apparent sub-optimality in active sensing and quantify the efficiency of choosing each individual fixation throughout scanning a whole scene. The study suggests that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations. The findings have implications for understanding how the brain processes visual information and how it can be optimized for tasks that require the integration of information from multiple locations. The study's approach is amenable to multiple tasks in different perceptual domains and provides a formalism that extends the range of active sensing to tasks with arbitrary, not necessarily spatial, latent features.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Despite its importance, the mechanisms governing the transport of large cargoes, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, through the NPC are not well understood. These large cargoes can be up to 15 nanometers in size and require specific molecular determinants for their nuclear import. This study aimed to investigate the requirements for nuclear transport of large cargoes, focusing on the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and the effect of size on import efficiency.

    To address this question, the authors developed 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nanometers, with tunable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. The nuclear import kinetics of these cargoes were assayed, and the results showed that the requirements for nuclear transport scale non-linearly with size. A simple two-parameter biophysical model was developed to correlate the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. This model revealed key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.

    Previous studies have shown that biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface influence nuclear transport for small cargoes. However, for large cargoes, the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via NLSs is critical. The authors demonstrated that cargoes with multiple NLSs can rapidly enter the nucleus, and their nuclear import kinetics follow a mono-exponential behavior. The study also highlights the importance of the nuclear transport machinery, including Importinβ, Importinα, RanGDP, NTF2, and GTP, in reconstituting functional nucleocytoplasmic transport.

    The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular determinants of large cargo transport into the nucleus and have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. The two-parameter biophysical model developed in this study can be used to predict the import efficiency of large cargoes and may aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to nucleocytoplasmic transport.
The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 plays a crucial role in the activation of helper T cells, but its function after T cell priming has been unclear. To investigate this, researchers generated mice with CD28 removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. The results show that continued CD28 expression is essential for the expansion of effector CD4+ T cells, particularly T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells during viral infection. Additionally, maintained CD28 expression is required for the clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract after oral infection. These findings demonstrate that CD28 persistence is necessary for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, revealing a novel function for CD28 distinct from its role in T cell priming. The study highlights the importance of CD28 in maintaining T cell responses following activation, which is critical for effective immunity to infection. The results suggest that CD28 expression is required for the expansion of Th1 cells and the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells, which are essential for clearing pathogens from the body. Furthermore, the study shows that CD28 expression is necessary for the clearance of Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract, indicating that CD28 plays a critical role in mucosal immunity. Overall, the study provides new insights into the function of CD28 in T cell responses and highlights its importance in maintaining effective immunity to infection.
Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that colonizes the stomach, relies on its helical shape to efficiently colonize the stomach lining. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of this helical shape are not well understood. A recent study investigated the role of cytoskeletal proteins in maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The researchers used quantitative 3D microscopy to analyze the growth patterns of H. pylori cells and found that cell wall synthesis is enhanced at both the positive and negative Gaussian curvatures of the helix. They also found that the cytoskeletal proteins MreB and CcmA are localized to specific regions of the cell, with MreB enriched at negative Gaussian curvature and CcmA enriched at positive Gaussian curvature. The study suggests that MreB and CcmA play a crucial role in promoting cell wall synthesis at these regions, which is necessary for maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The researchers propose a model in which MreB and CcmA work together to pattern cell wall synthesis, with MreB promoting synthesis at negative Gaussian curvature and CcmA promoting synthesis at positive Gaussian curvature. This patterning is thought to be one mechanism necessary for maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The study also found that H. pylori achieves a broader distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature than other curved-rod bacteria, such as Campylobacter crescentus and Vibrio cholerae, and uses distinct mechanisms to achieve these curvatures. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the helical shape of H. pylori and highlights the importance of cytoskeletal proteins in maintaining this shape. The findings have implications for our understanding of the biology of H. pylori and may inform the development of new treatments for H. pylori infections.
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by integrating the activities of two deubiquitylases (DUBs), Ubp12 and Ubp2. These DUBs exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion by cleaving different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. Cdc48 promotes the proteolysis of Ubp12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1, while the loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2, facilitating the removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that inhibit fusion. This cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation, allowing for mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover.

The study reveals a new cascade of ubiquitylation events involving Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, which fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which in turn negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis. The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that either promote or repress mitochondrial fusion. Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation precedes Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation on Fzo1, and unopposed anti-fusion ubiquitylation disrupts mitochondrial tubulation.

Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a small number of ubiquitin moieties and does not stabilize its substrates because their ubiquitin chains are too short to target proteasomal turnover. In contrast, Ubp2 recognizes and cleaves ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion. The study provides new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and highlights the importance of Cdc48 in integrating the activities of Ubp12 and Ubp2 to control the balance between activation and repression of mitochondrial fusion.
The study investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers characterized VOTC responses to eight categories presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals, and visually in a separate sighted group. The results showed that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind people, using a representational structure and connectivity partially similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group than the sighted group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision.

The study found that VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups. The results demonstrate that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience, and that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people.

Representational similarity analysis revealed that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind people, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds. The study also found that VOTC reliably encodes the categorical membership of sounds from eight different categories in sighted and blind people, using a topography, representational format, and representational connectivity profile partially similar to the one observed in response to images of similar categories in vision.

However, the categorical representation of the auditory stimuli in VOTC of both blind and sighted individuals exhibits different qualitative nuances compared to the categorical organization generated by visual stimuli in sighted people. The study suggests that the overlap in categorical responses between groups may come from the fact that VOTC represents visual attributes in the sighted and acoustic attributes in the blind due to crossmodal plasticity.
Scientists have discovered a strain of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly, in the laboratory. The fungus, known as E. muscae ‘Berkeley’, induces a range of moribund behaviors in infected flies, including climbing upward, extending their proboscides, and raising their wings, which allows the fungus to launch infectious spores from their abdomens. The researchers found that E. muscae invades the nervous system of the host fly, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes.

To study the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system, the researchers isolated and characterized the E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ strain and its impact on D. melanogaster behavior in the laboratory. They found that the invasion of the nervous system by E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ grants the fungus direct access to host neurons, which may be mechanistically important for achieving behavioral manipulation of the host fly. However, the researchers caution that there may be other possible ways E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ could alter host behavior.

The researchers propose four general mechanisms by which E. muscae is able to achieve behavioral manipulation of the host fly. To test whether E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ is capable of causing patent infection in hosts outside of Drosophilidae, they exposed house flies to E. muscae ‘Berkeley’-infected D. melanogaster and observed that the house flies died and subsequently sporulated, indicating that they had been killed by the fungus.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ infection progresses in D. melanogaster at the molecular level, the researchers measured how transcription changes in both host and fungus at 24-hour time points over 5 days. They found that early on, infected flies are phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected animals, making it challenging to study the progression of the infection. The researchers believe that the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior, given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster.
The study presents transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors are involved in mRNA deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and RNA surveillance pathways, including nuclear RNA surveillance and cytoplasmic nonsense-mediated decay. The profiles were generated using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes. The results are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs. The study provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism. Bioinformatics analysis of the profiles revealed how degradation factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and with respect to their preferred locations on RNA transcripts. Global comparisons of the profiles alongside previously published profiles of other RNA-binding factors revealed clusters of factors that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize on RNAs.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, camalexin is a potent defense compound that can be rapidly induced in response to bacterial and fungal infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the rapid activation of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal are not fully understood. To investigate this, researchers combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping and found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications : trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( H3K18ac ). These modifications have opposite effects on gene expression, with H3K27me3 repressing and H3K18ac activating gene expression. The researchers discovered that these two modifications co-localize on camalexin biosynthesis genes to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin, which they named kairostat. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac showed that both modifications are required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. The study suggests that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants. By integrating epigenomic profiles with a genome-wide metabolic network in Arabidopsis, the researchers found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are enriched at camalexin biosynthesis and several other specialized metabolic pathways. In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively. These findings provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. The study highlights the importance of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in controlling the timely induction of gene expression in response to stress stimuli in plants.
The study investigated the role of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, in neurogenic astrocytes of the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). Astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the SVZ express EZH2, which is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation. The study found that EZH2 directly represses the Ink4a/Arf locus to enable SVZ NSC self-renewal, and its repression of Olig2, a bHLH transcription factor, is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, EZH2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells, including local astroglia, also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. The study establishes EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain, and identifies distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. These results provide novel insights into the complex role that EZH2 plays in normal development and gliomagenesis. The study also suggests that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population. Acute deletion of Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis, and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation. Re-expression of Ezh2 in Ezh2-deleted, Ink4a/Arf-null SVZ NSCs rescued neurogenesis, indicating that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis that is distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression. The study highlights the importance of EZH2 in regulating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology, which has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis. Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes.
This study investigated the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in a model marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from 127 SUP05 bacteria isolated from the OMZ were analyzed to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. The results suggest that approximately one-third of SUP05 bacteria are infected with viruses, with higher infection frequencies observed in areas with more severe oxygen deficiency. The study also found evidence of co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses, indicating previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. Furthermore, the study identified virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase, suggesting that SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. The findings demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs. The study used single-cell genomics to directly link SUP05 viruses and their hosts across defined gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a 3-year time interval in a model OMZ ecosystem. This spatiotemporal resolution revealed endemic patterns of co-infection between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and the occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) with the potential to modulate electron transfer reactions essential to SUP05 energy metabolism. SUP05 Microviridae contigs were inconsistently detected due to methodological biases, so the study focused on dsDNA viral contigs. All 4 SUP05 Caudovirales contigs were absent from surface waters, but repeatedly detected within and below the oxycline, consistent with SUP05 water column disposition. The study also found that putative SUP05 phage contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase A and C, positing a role for viruses in modulating the marine sulfur cycle.
The study investigated the role of TTC26/DYF13, a putative intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein, in the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, the researchers found that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in both mammalian cells and C. reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility, but surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in the dyf13 mutant flagella. Proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed that a specific set of proteins involved in motility was depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery. The study also found that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis per se, but rather plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella. In contrast to other IFT proteins, TTC26/DYF13 is not necessary for the assembly or movement of the IFT particle, but rather is involved in the transport of a specific subset of proteins involved in flagellar motility. The study provides new insights into the role of TTC26/DYF13 in the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella, and highlights the complexity of the IFT machinery. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella.
The interaction between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) plays a crucial role in the metastasis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Research has shown that the presence of LECs in the tumor microenvironment can stimulate the growth and spread of melanoma cells to distant organs. A recent study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and found that LECs induce the activation of matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14 ), Notch3, and β1-integrin in melanoma cells, leading to an invasive sprouting phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by the ability of melanoma cells to invade and spread through three-dimensional matrices. The study used a combination of 2D and 3D co-culture models, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies, and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay to investigate the effects of LECs on melanoma cells. The results showed that the interaction between LECs and melanoma cells increased the metastasis of melanoma xenografts in mice, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3. The study also found that the upregulation of Notch3 upon LEC priming was a key event in the metastatic process, and that β1-integrin activation was required for the 3D sprouting of melanoma cells. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of LECs in the metastasis of melanoma and highlight the importance of MMP14 and Notch3 in this process. The study also suggests that the LEC-melanoma interaction model can be used to identify previously unrecognized pathways and molecules contributing to lymphatic metastasis of melanoma. The results of this study have important implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat melanoma metastasis.
The study investigated the role of microRNA-9 (miR-9) in dendritic development and synaptic transmission in the brain. miR-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain and has been well-characterized in neural progenitors, but its function in dendritic and synaptic development has remained largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, the researchers developed a transgenic mouse line that allows for the conditional inactivation of miR-9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, the study found that miR-9 plays a crucial role in controlling dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. The results of this study define a key role for miR-9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons and reveal a novel developmental function of miR-9 in the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation. The study used a double reporter mouse line to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain and found that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. The study also found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in mice expressing the miR-9 sponge. The results suggest that miR-9 exerts its function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of miR-9 in dendritic development and synaptic transmission and highlights the importance of miR-9 in the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation.
The study investigated the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by examining resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a large sample of ASD toddlers and non-ASD comparison groups. The results showed that ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity was observed between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. Specifically, a subtype of ASD characterized by pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties, referred to as GeoPref ASD, was found to have marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. This hypoconnectivity was also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD. The study suggests that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals. The findings provide evidence for atypical intrinsic functional brain organization in early ASD development, involving circuitry relevant to social visual engagement, and highlight the importance of heterogeneity in early social engagement in explaining functional connectivity differences present in early ASD toddlers. The study used a simple and easy-to-implement eye tracking test to identify the GeoPref ASD subtype, which can be used as a robust behavioral assay for early ASD diagnosis. The results have implications for understanding the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in ASD and may inform the development of targeted interventions for early ASD diagnosis and treatment.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the hematopoietic system produces two types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells similar to vertebrate macrophages and are mitotically active, increasing in number throughout larval development through self-renewal. However, the increase in crystal cell numbers during larval development remains unexplained, as mature crystal cells have not been observed dividing during this stage and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation under homeostatic conditions. To address this paradox, researchers investigated the origin of new crystal cells in third instar larvae and found that they arise through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in sessile hemocyte clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The study reveals that the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, involving a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate signaling. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, which relies on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for understanding Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishes further parallels with vertebrate systems. The findings suggest that the study of hematopoietic organs and their structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled. This novel hematopoietic organ, dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events, brings us closer to addressing outstanding fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis.
Aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, has been linked to various diseases but also plays a role in organismal evolution. While laboratory strains are highly sensitive to aneuploidy, researchers have found that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which exhibit lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. To investigate this phenomenon, the authors generated diploid strain panels with cells carrying two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes and observed that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10–30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. The authors also found that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009 by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. This study presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution. The results show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains exhibit lower-than-expected expression, which is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes. These findings provide new insight into the long-standing conundrum of how cells tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve. The study also raises the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation, where the expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to gene copy, but many genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation.
The article reports the discovery of extraocular, rod-like photoreceptors in the flatworm Maritigrella crozieri that express the xenopsin photopigment. Xenopsin is a recently classified subtype of opsin that was initially thought to belong to the Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins but has since been found to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times. The study characterizes xenopsin in Maritigrella crozieri and finds that it is expressed in ciliary cells of the eyes in the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole, known as a phaosome. Functional assays in human cells show that Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi. The findings highlight similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveal a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that, like jawed vertebrate rods, encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane. In the adult, xenopsin+ extraocular, ciliary cells were found to have a distinct ultrastructure, similar to that of jawed vertebrate rod photoreceptors. The study also carried out the first functional cellular assays on a xenopsin, exploring whether polyclad xenopsin can form a photopigment and which classes of Gα protein it can couple to. The results suggest that xenopsin couples to Gαi, as evidenced by primary activation of a Gαi signal transduction cascade in living human cells and co-localization of xenopsin and Gαi in the same putative ciliary photoreceptor in a flatworm. Additionally, xenopsin protein expression was found on cilia of cells that form eyes, supporting the possibility that the VxPx motif is involved in transporting xenopsin to cilia. The discovery of xenopsin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution by deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors. Overall, the study provides molecular and functional evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms and highlights the similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin.
The integration of spatial and temporal cues is crucial for the specification of neuronal diversity in neural progenitors. However, the mechanisms by which these cues are integrated remain unknown. Drosophila neuroblasts, which are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal transcription factors, provide a suitable model system to investigate this process. This study aimed to determine whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts by examining the genomic binding sites of the temporal transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that produce different progeny.

    Targeted DamID was used to identify the genomic binding sites of Hb in NB5-6 and NB7-4. The results showed that Hb targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Furthermore, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. The study also found that the spatial factor Gsb/Pax3, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4.

    The data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. The study identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4, which are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. These findings contribute to our understanding of how spatial and temporal cues are integrated during neurogenesis and provide insights into the mechanisms of neuronal diversity in Drosophila and potentially in mammals. The study highlights the importance of early-acting spatial factors in establishing neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, which in turn influence the binding of temporal transcription factors and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.
Scientists have long sought to understand how P2X receptors function by opening a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP. Recent crystal structures have revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding, but the mechanism of pore opening remains unclear. To investigate this, researchers used photo-switchable cross-linkers as ‘molecular tweezers’ to monitor inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints were combined with computational studies to provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. The results show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure, and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. This study provides new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establishes a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins. The researchers used photo-switchable azobenzene tweezers to cross-link engineered cysteine residues in the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) of the rat P2X2 receptor. By controlling the end-to-end distance of the tweezers with light, they were able to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the TMD during activation. The data revealed a critical ‘hinge’ in the TM2 helices that facilitates their vertical bending, allowing the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer during activation. This study provides the first application of photo-switchable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P2X receptors. The results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that breaking of one TM2-TM2 interface is sufficient for gating, and that the light-induced outward expansion of a single TM2-TM2 interface is likely a local rearrangement of the TMD. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the gating mechanism of full-length, membrane-embedded P2X receptors, as previous X-ray structures may represent non-native, open-channel states.
The regulation of cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, has long been thought to be a conserved process across animal cells. However, recent evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types may exhibit more variation than previously assumed. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, researchers identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. This variation was found to be cell-intrinsically regulated in one cell (P2) and cell-extrinsically regulated in another cell (EMS), dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2.

    The study used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. The results showed cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis. In contrast to the one-cell embryo, forminCYK-1 (ts) embryos showed cell-type variation in the temporal requirement for activity among individual blastomeres.

    The researchers used fast-acting temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction in the one-cell embryo: the motor myosin-II (NMY-2 in C. elegans, hereafter myosin-IINMY-2) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1 (hereafter forminCYK-1). They identified cell-type-specific variation in four-cell embryos in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2. These findings suggest that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo.

    The study demonstrates that each cell in the four-cell C. elegans embryo has a unique cell identity and can be individually scored for contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis. The combination of thermogenetics with cell-type-specific in vivo and ex vivo analysis of cytokinesis in each blastomere of the four-cell C. elegans embryo allowed the researchers to study the mechanisms of cytokinetic variation. The results show that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.
Bacterial flagella play a crucial role in mediating host-microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization and activation of immune responses. The flagellar shaft of certain bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this structural feature has remained an enigma. A recent study has demonstrated that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist Vibrio fischeri and the pathogen Vibrio cholerae promotes the release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), found in the flagellar sheath. This finding reveals a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. The study used the model squid-vibrio symbiosis to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition and uncovered a previously unrecognized role for the rotation of sheathed flagella in mediating the release of LPS in both V. fischeri and V. cholerae. The flagellar sheath has been difficult to study due to the lack of mutations that result in the loss of a sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella. The functional role of the sheath, even as it relates to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized. The study's findings further our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence. Further work will build upon these discoveries and clarify the mechanisms underlying signaling during initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis, including characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS, and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses. The study suggests that biosynthesis of the flagellum, and its subsequent functions, may mediate multiple aspects of symbiotic initiation. The findings have implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raise important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function.
The article describes a phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, specifically in Arabidopsis, resulting from the hybridization of plants expressing different centromere histones H3. This process leads to the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions suggests that breaks are followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair.

    The study found that mutation of the NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, indicating that NHEJ plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny. Inhibition of NHEJ leads to an increase in haploid induction frequency, suggesting that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase the elimination of the haploid inducer genome. The study also suggests that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks, and occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued.

    The results provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species. The study also highlights the importance of NHEJ in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes, contributing to the formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny.

    The findings have implications for understanding the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders. The study provides a tractable, natural system for investigating the consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity, which can be dire, leading to aneuploidy and catastrophic restructuring. The results suggest that the study of genome elimination in plants can provide insights into the mechanisms of genomic instability and the potential for enduring genomic novelty.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a causative agent of several human cancers, and its latent infection is characterized by the expression of viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 plays a critical role in the survival of EBV-immortalized B cells by constitutively activating NFκB. However, during early infection, EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection, researchers employed BH3 profiling to investigate mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis in EBV-infected cells. The study revealed a dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms, transitioning from uninfected B cells (BCL-2) to early-infected cells (MCL-1/BCL-2) and immortalized cells (BFL-1). This transition is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on the regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. EBNA3A regulates the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells, suppressing apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription. Furthermore, the study identified a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation. The findings suggest that uninfected human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival, while EBV upregulates additional survival proteins, including MCL-1 and BFL-1, to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism. The study highlights the importance of EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during EBV infection and has implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.
The study of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism for plant biology, has revealed that genetic variation, environment, and demography intersect to shape the diversity of defense metabolites across Europe. The researchers analyzed a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis accessions and found that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetic processes influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This suggests that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns indicating potential within-species convergence. The study highlights the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing local adaptation. The Arabidopsis-GSL system is an optimal model to study species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation due to the known identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway and major causal loci for natural variation. The level of allelic diversity at these loci raises questions about how pathways with this level of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries. The study used a family of specialized metabolites, aliphatic GSLs, and measured their amounts in seeds of A. thaliana to query how genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersect to shape chemotypic variation across Europe. The results show that the intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species. The study provides a new perspective on the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing local adaptation. The findings have implications for understanding how genomic variation, demography, and environmental pressure shape the variation of specialized metabolism within a species.
Apoptotic caspases have traditionally been regarded as tumor suppressors due to their role in programmed cell death. However, recent studies suggest that under certain conditions, these caspases can also promote tumor growth and proliferation. In Drosophila, a well-studied neoplastic tumor model, oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras ( RasV12 ) maintain tumorous cells in an ‘undead’-like condition, transforming caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promoters. Instead of inducing apoptosis, caspases in RasV12-modified cells generate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells. These immune cells signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling, creating a feedback amplification loop that promotes caspase activity. This loop is essential for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior. Interfering with the amplification loop significantly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and improves organismal survival. The study demonstrates that caspases can adopt a tumor-promoting role under specific conditions, such as in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells. The tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of ROS, which are required for neoplastic behavior. Inhibition of caspases blocks tumor growth and tissue invasion, highlighting the complex and context-dependent role of caspases in cancer development. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor growth and suggest that targeting the amplification loop involving ROS, macrophages, and JNK signaling may be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
A recent study investigated the relationship between social interaction and subjective time perception, revealing that the perception of social interaction compresses subjective duration in an oxytocin-dependent manner. The study found that motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively were perceived to be significantly shorter in duration compared to those acting noncommunicatively. This effect was negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency, suggesting that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the temporal compression effect. Furthermore, intranasal oxytocin administration restored the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate that perceived time is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait, rather than being a faithful representation of physical time. The study also suggests that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition. The results are consistent with previous research associating autistic traits with reduced levels of oxytocin and the amelioration of these traits with intranasal oxytocin administration. The study highlights the complex relationship between social interaction, subjective time perception, and oxytocin, and provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of social behavior and the potential therapeutic applications of oxytocin in social disorders. The study employed a series of experiments to investigate the relationship between social interaction, subjective time perception, and oxytocin. Experiment 1 found that motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively were perceived to be significantly shorter in duration compared to those acting noncommunicatively. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and highlighted the idiosyncrasy of subjective time for social interactions. Experiment 3 found that the temporal compression effect was negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency. Experiment 4 found that socially less proficient individuals were less susceptible to the temporal compression effect. Experiment 5 probed the role of oxytocin in mediating the temporal compression effect and found that intranasal oxytocin administration restored the effect in socially less proficient individuals. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between social interaction, subjective time perception, and oxytocin, and highlights the potential therapeutic applications of oxytocin in social disorders.
The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is crucial for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that have emerged independently worldwide. This study investigated the effects of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The study analyzed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P1) variants. The results showed that most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, with the exceptions being mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations were found to enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, while the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape. The study also examined the effect on ACE2 binding of combinations of RBD mutations, including combinations present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage (N501Y) with the E484K mutation, and the Beta and Gamma variants. The results suggest that carriers of ACE2 variants with mutations S19P and K26R will be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. The study provides precise information to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion.
The study presents a comprehensive genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells using combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping. The map comprises 1367 Drosophila genes implicated in various biological processes, including signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation, and protein turnover control. To generate the map, the researchers co-depleted gene pairs by RNAi in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, high-throughput imaged single-cell phenotypes, and modelled gene–gene interactions. This approach enabled the identification of directional, epistatic interactions between genes, which reflect regulatory relationships between them. The study reveals that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that is conserved in human cancer cells. The epistatic map also reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis and provided a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal, and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling, which was confirmed in vivo. The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations. The epistatic map highlights an unexpected link between chromatin remodelling and RAS signalling, with genetic interactions between the SWI/SNF complex and the SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeller dalao. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulatory relationships between genes and offer a valuable resource for understanding the functional consequences of genetic alterations in metazoan cells.
Heterostyly, a floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding, is a widespread phenomenon in plants, but its genetic basis and evolutionary origin remain poorly understood. In Primula (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes have remained unknown. A recent study has identified the CYP734A50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism in Primula. CYP734A50 is present only on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. The results indicate that CYP734A50 represents the G locus in the Primula heterostyly supergene, whose expression in S-morph styles causes brassinosteroid degradation, limiting cell expansion and style elongation. The proposed duplication and gain of style-specific expression of CYP734A50 in the ancestor of the Primulaceae likely represents the dominant style-shortening mutation. CYP734A50 is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism, opening the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus as an iconic case of a complex supergene. Heterostyly evolved only once in the genus Primula, and the same causal genes should co-segregate with morph phenotypes in all heterostylous Primula species. The study sequenced style transcriptomes of the distantly related Primula species and found that the CYP734A50 presence/absence polymorphism strictly co-segregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the Primula phylogeny, and the gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. The results strongly support the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism. Heterostyly in Primula is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which likely comprises five tightly linked genes, determining style length, anther height, pollen size, and male and female intra-morph incompatibility.
Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and neurokinin B (NKB) neurocircuits play a crucial role in pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin, and glutamate, and are thought to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons. To investigate the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity, researchers used optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons was found to evoke the local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronized the firing of Kiss1ARH neurons. This synchronized activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons through a synaptic mechanism involving glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. The researchers propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

The study found that high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was modulated by co-released dynorphin, and caused synchronization of Kiss1ARH neurons. Additionally, activation of Kiss1ARH neurons co-released glutamate that excited the rostral Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons. Kiss1ARH neurons also communicate with the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge. Kisspeptin, GPR54, NKB, Tacr3, and GnRH are all required for normal fertility. The study suggests that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving pulsatile (episodic) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway.
Title: Bone morphogenic protein signalling suppresses differentiation of pluripotent cells by maintaining expression of E-Cadherin

    Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency of cells and favouring mesodermal over neural fates during differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. Recent research has shed light on this process, revealing that BMP signalling suppresses differentiation by maintaining the expression of E-Cadherin (Cdh1).

    The study found that the loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. Furthermore, BMP signalling acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus reinforcing the block to neural differentiation. This suggests that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues.

    BMP signalling is known to contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. The study proposes that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining Cdh1 expression, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate. This finding helps to explain why BMP can simultaneously protect pluripotency and promote mesoderm differentiation.

    The study also identified the BMP target gene Id1, which imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm. This suggests that the ability of Id1 to block neural differentiation is not due to inhibition of a neural-inducing transcription factor or direct activation of mesoderm differentiation, but rather to a shift in the positional identity of pluripotent cells that occurs in the absence of overt differentiation.

    In summary, the study reveals that BMP signalling suppresses differentiation of pluripotent cells by maintaining Cdh1 expression, which is a limiting event for the earliest stages of neural differentiation. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation and highlight the importance of morphogenetic events in controlling receptivity to differentiation cues.
A novel Cep120-dependent mechanism has been identified that inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells. The study reveals that Cep120, a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, plays a critical role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis by regulating the levels of pericentriolar material (PCM) components. In quiescent mouse and human cells, depletion of Cep120 leads to an accumulation of PCM components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170, resulting in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. This, in turn, causes aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling.

The study demonstrates that Cep120 inhibits the maturation of the daughter centriole by regulating PCM levels during quiescence. Loss of Cep120 initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately result in defective ciliary assembly and function. The first step involves changes in the maturation state of the daughter centriole, on which Cep120 is preferentially enriched. These changes disrupt ciliary assembly and signaling, a process that requires CS-dependent delivery of essential factors to the centrosome.

Cep120 regulates the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome by residing on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules. Loss of Cep120 during quiescence is detrimental to ciliary assembly and function, likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centrosome. The study suggests that loss of Cep120 disrupts the localization of CS, due to changes in PCM abundance, microtubule organization, and dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins.

The dispersal of centriolar satellites upon Cep120 loss disrupts the formation and/or function of cilia during quiescence. The study establishes the important and exquisitely sensitive control of centrosome PCM homeostasis and its relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling. The findings uncover a potentially new type of molecular defect that may underlie the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.
In the developing retina, neuron-glia interactions play a crucial role in the maturation of neural circuits, but the pathways that mediate their communication are not well understood. A recent study investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina and found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells ( MCs ). The study used whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed specifically in MCs to examine the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways of neuron-glia interactions. The results showed that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, indicating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. During cholinergic retinal waves, MC calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. This suggests that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor, the study found that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. The results indicate that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses. The study also found that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from postnatal day 9 to 11, despite the presence of retinal waves. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina and highlight the importance of neurotransmitter spillover in enabling correlated activity between neurons and MCs.
The postmortem interval (PMI), the time elapsed since death, is a critical factor in death investigations. However, current methods for estimating PMI, such as forensic entomology, are prone to errors and biases. A novel approach to estimating PMI has been proposed using microbial communities, which may provide a more accurate and reliable method. In a mouse model system, researchers have demonstrated that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable, allowing for the estimation of PMI within approximately 3 days over a 48-day period. This study provides a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggests that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI.

    The researchers conducted a laboratory experiment to characterize temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. Bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes were characterized using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample. The data collected allowed the researchers to assess hypotheses about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition and rigorously test whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition.

    The study expands upon previous research by Pechal et al. (2013), which demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. In contrast, this study characterized microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days. The results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI. The study's findings have implications for understanding the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition and the feasibility of using microbes as evidence in forensic investigations.
Despite the vast diversity of body forms in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. The Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior–posterior axis, are one such set of genes. Hox proteins exert their function by interacting with TALE transcription factors. However, the presence of Hox and TALE members in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla raises the question of how Hox–TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. To address this question, researchers used proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages to show that Hox–TALE networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. These networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. The results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans. The study proposes that Hox–TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing for diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. The Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. The study suggests that the molecular cues underlying the Hox–TALE patterning system in Bilateria were established stepwise during eukaryote evolution. The Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution, with Cnidaria being the only non-bilaterian phylum to possess a bona fide Hox repertoire. The presence of PBC and Meis proteins in non-bilaterian phyla suggests that these proteins played a key role in the evolution of Hox patterning functions. Overall, the study provides insights into the origin of the Hox–TALE patterning system and its evolution during eukaryote evolution.
The study used super-resolution microscopy to investigate the dynamics of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in post-synaptic densities (PSDs) and extrasynaptic regions of rat neurons. The researchers employed different-sized fluorescent probes, including organic dyes, small quantum dots (sQDs), and large quantum dots (bQDs), to label AMPARs and track their movement. The results showed that the majority of AMPARs labeled with sQDs or organic dyes were diffusing in confined nanodomains within PSDs, which were stable for 15 minutes or longer. In contrast, bQDs labeled AMPARs were mostly found in extrasynaptic regions, consistent with previous observations. The study suggests that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. The findings contradict the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD "slots." The researchers used sQDs to study the dynamics of AMPAR nanodomains in synapses for extended periods, up to 60 minutes, and found that the localization of AMPARs is predominantly at synaptic regions. The study also observed that there is typically one nanodomain per synapse, although multiple nanodomains can exist. The use of bQDs was found to be problematic due to their large size, which may prevent AMPARs from entering the synaptic cleft. In contrast, sQDs and organic dyes labeled AMPARs were found to be overwhelmingly in the synapse, with 84-97% of AMPARs immobilized within PSDs and only 5-16% freely diffusing in the dendrite membrane. The study's findings provide new insights into the dynamics of AMPARs in PSDs and extrasynaptic regions, shedding light on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.
The study investigated the early response of central neurons to acute hypoxia, specifically the increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa). The researchers found that hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels increases INa. The time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1.2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. The study suggests that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions, given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage. The results show that hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of NaV1.2 is observed in the presence of TTX, indicating that Na+ flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation. Consistent with tonic control of INa by the SUMO pathway, SUMO1 and SENP1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of INa to hypoxia was ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of NaV1.2 channels. The study directly showed that hypoxia increases the interaction of native SUMO1 and NaV1.2 channels. The findings suggest that NaV1.2 channels and SUMO pathway enzymes may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. The study demonstrates that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in INa in response to acute hypoxia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. The results are consistent with previous studies showing that SUMOylation increases excitability by suppressing the activity of background K+ channels and voltage-gated K+ channels.
The article presents a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus (RRV), a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. The model predicts that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). This non-linear relationship between temperature and transmission is critical for understanding the dynamics of the disease and predicting responses to climate change. The model accurately predicts that RRV transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming is likely to increase transmission in temperate areas, where most Australians live, but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum.

The study highlights the importance of non-linear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. Thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vector species, yet mechanistic models based on empirical, unimodal thermal responses are lacking for many diseases and vectors. The authors parameterized a temperature-dependent model for RRV transmission using data from two important vector species (Cx. annulirostris and Ae. vigilax). The results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission, where the well-resolved optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan, but upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector-pathogen systems.

The study found that the strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve (20-25°C). Additionally, upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves, such as fecundity and survival at various life stages, rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves, such as biting rate or pathogen development rate.
Title: Beta band oscillations in motor cortex reflect neural population signals that delay movement onset

    Motor cortical beta oscillations have been extensively studied for decades, yet their behavioral correlates remain poorly understood. Recent studies have linked beta oscillations to changes in underlying neural activity, but the specific behavioral manifestations of these changes have remained elusive. To investigate how changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked, researchers recorded multi-scale neural activity from motor cortex while three macaques performed a novel neurofeedback task. The subjects volitionally brought their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and subsequently executed an arm reach.

    The results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Furthermore, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This finding establishes a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity.

    Notably, this shift in neural population was also seen in naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts. This study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity.

    The results of this study support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements. The behavioral effect from neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations matches well with hypotheses claiming a movement-slowing role of beta oscillations during natural movements. However, individual unit responses during beta activity were found to be different across tasks.

    Simultaneously recorded units were analyzed and shown to exhibit different activity during neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations compared with natural beta oscillations occurring during typical reaching tasks. Despite differences at an individual unit level, population-level analyses show that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both the CO and NR tasks, matching what is observed behaviorally.
TRAF2, a component of TNF superfamily signalling complexes, plays a crucial role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. However, the function of TRAF2 in adult tissues is not well-understood due to the early lethality of TRAF2-deficient mice. This study investigated the role of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, the primary cell type of the epidermis, and its relationship with sphingosine kinase 1 ( Sphk1 ). Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2 resulted in disrupted TNF-mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling, leading to epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB, and the adaptive immune system, and may represent a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. In contrast, Sphk1 deficiency did not disrupt TNF signalling in keratinocytes, indicating that TRAF2 has essential tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1. The absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes caused a delay in TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPK, and increased sensitivity to killing by TNF. Furthermore, TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes produced inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in the absence of TNF, leading to a psoriasis-like phenotype with slower onset. The study highlights the importance of TRAF2 in protecting keratinocytes from cell death and down-regulating inflammatory responses, and suggests that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Concomitant deletion of Tnf in mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes broke the vicious cycle of inflammation and prevented apoptosis of keratinocytes and the early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype. These findings provide new insights into the role of TRAF2 in keratinocytes and its relationship with Sphk1, and may have implications for the understanding and treatment of psoriasis. TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes were also sensitive to TNF-induced death, associated with a rapid reduction in cFLIPL levels and caspase-8 cleavage. Primary keratinocytes isolated from wild-type, Traf2EKO, and Sphk1-/- mice were tested, and TNF signalling was delayed and weakened in Traf2-deficient keratinocytes, but not Sphk1-deficient keratinocytes.
The process of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling involves the rapid endocytosis of SV membranes after exocytosis to form large endocytic vacuoles, known as bulk endosomes. These vacuoles then convert into new SVs to replenish the pool of fusion-competent vesicles. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and dynamin 1 and 3 (Dyn1 and Dyn3) have been implicated in this process. However, a recent study investigated the role of Dyn1 and Dyn3 in bulk endocytosis and the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs in the absence of CME.

Using synapses of Dyn1 and Dyn3 double knockout (DKO) neurons, the study found that bulk endocytosis was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of Dyn1 and Dyn3. Furthermore, the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after further clathrin knockdown. This suggests that the process of SV reformation from bulk endosomes is independent of clathrin and Dyn1/3.

The study used soluble horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling to analyze bulk endocytosis and the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs in wild-type (WT) and Dyn mutant synapses. The results showed that the absence of Dyn1 and Dyn3 delayed, but did not abolish, SV reformation from internal membranes. Ultrastructural analysis of the time course of SV recovery from bulk endosomes in the presence or near depletion of clathrin led to similar conclusions.

These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and Dyn1/3 and operates during intense synaptic activity. This pathway is distinct from the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway and highlights the complexity of SV recycling mechanisms. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and the regulation of SV recycling.
The study aimed to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in humans. A randomized, crossover, single-blind trial was conducted in 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency, who underwent physiological GC exposure and withdrawal. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma microRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. A transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster were identified as predictive of GC exposure. A microRNA (miR-122-5p) was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by GC exposure (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying GC exposure (0.01≤p≤0.05). This study provides a basis for the discovery of biomarkers to measure the effects of GCs, allowing for individualized and optimized GC therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological GC exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. The study used a multi-omic analysis strategy combining data from gene expression in circulation and adipose tissue, integrated with circulating microRNAs and metabolites, to identify putative biomarkers. The strongest putative biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure. A transcriptomic profile under similar GC regulation in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue transcriptomes was identified and validated by comparison to previously published data from cellular assays. A circulating microRNA, miR-122-5p, was correlated with the circulating transcriptome and metabolome findings, suggesting a functional role in GC action. Two subjects did not show this miR-122-5p response, one man and one woman who experienced mild mental fatigue during GC withdrawal. The study was funded by several organizations, including the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish federal government, and the Wellcome Trust.
The dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids have been examined in a study using live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester. The results show that the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaking within 5 minutes. This translocation is temporally coupled with the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino acid stimulation. The study also found that Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity, respectively. Furthermore, phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere. The study used HAP-1 cells and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of leucine to image RAPTOR translocation in response to this compound. The results suggest that the lysosome is a crucial locus for mTOR activation, but the dynamics of this process and how mTORC1 activity is connected to lysosomal residence may be more complicated than current models. The study provides a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, supporting the idea that amino acids ultimately activate mTORC1 in the cell interior, and that more than one type of sensing (and amino acid) is involved.
The modification of antigens with specific glycan structures can significantly alter their intracellular routing in dendritic cells, thereby influencing the type and strength of immune responses. In a recent study, researchers demonstrated that the addition of the LewisX (LeX) glycan to the model antigen Ovalbumin (OVA) redirected it towards the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. This re-routing resulted in enhanced cross-presentation of OVA to CD8+ T cells and favored the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells towards Th1 cells, which produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). The LeX-modified OVA also reduced the required antigen dose for cross-presentation by 100-fold and eliminated the need for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.

    The study found that MGL1-dependent cross-presentation of OVA-LeX occurred independently of TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S, and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of the antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ compartments. Furthermore, the use of MGL1-deficient mice revealed that MGL1 is the primary lectin involved in boosting the generation of antigen-specific effector T cells. Immunization of MGL1-deficient mice with LeX-conjugated OVA did not result in enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α-double-producing T cells.

    The findings of this study suggest that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can influence intracellular routing, antigen presentation, and the type and strength of immune responses. The conjugation of LeX glycans to OVA enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells, indicating that this approach may be useful for optimizing current vaccination strategies. Overall, the study highlights the importance of glycan structures in modulating immune responses and provides new insights into the mechanisms of antigen presentation and T cell priming.
In the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, quorum sensing (QS) plays a crucial role in regulating hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion (T6S) toxin-immunity systems. Research has shown that QS activates T6S in B. thailandensis, which is essential for constraining the proliferation of QS mutants in colony cocultures. A QS mutant, BtaR1, was found to outcompete its parent in broth cocultures due to the absence of cell contact and a metabolic cost associated with QS gene activation. However, when grown on agar surfaces, the parent strain had a fitness advantage over the BtaR1 mutant, which was dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. This suggests that QS activates B. thailandensis T6SS-1 growth inhibition, serving as a mechanism to police and constrain QS mutants.

    The study demonstrated that QS control of T6SS-1-mediated toxicity and immunity genes allows QS-competent members of B. thailandensis colonies to police against BtaR1-QS mutants. During planktonic growth in broth, where T6SS-1 does not function due to limited cell contact, BtaR1-mutants had a substantial fitness advantage over wild-type cells, likely due to the cost associated with BtaR1-dependent activities. In contrast, on agar surfaces, wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing, where QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal-blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system.

    The study highlights a novel mechanism for limiting QS mutant growth in bacterial groups, which is distinct from previously reported mechanisms in Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. B. thailandensis T6S-mediated killing is active against Proteobacteria species other than B. thailandensis and is thought to be important for interspecies competition. The results demonstrate that the parent strain, with an intact QS system, expresses quorum-activated T6SS-1 toxin and immunity proteins, whereas the BtaR1-mutant does not fully induce its T6SS-1 effectors and immunity factors.
The study investigated the role of glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus in boosting prelimbic oscillations in neonatal mice. Long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks is crucial for cognitive performance and emerges early in life. Discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, but the cellular substrate of these early interactions remains unresolved. To address this, the study selectively targeted optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age. The results show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in the dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. These findings provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral hippocampus, but not dorsal hippocampus, elicits broad band oscillations in the prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to prefrontal cortex via direct axonal projections suggest that the hippocampus acts as a drive for prelimbic activation already at neonatal age. The differences identified between dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus-prelimbic communication argue for prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis. The study provides new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain and highlights the need to investigate how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) undergoes dynamic post-translational modifications to coordinate the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. Phosphorylation of serine residues at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII has been extensively studied, with serine-5 and serine-7 phosphorylation marking transcription initiation and serine-2 phosphorylation coinciding with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of serine-7 into lysine-7 (K7), which can be acetylated (K7ac). This study describes the mono- and di-methylation of CTD lysine-7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2), which are observed during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany serine-5 and serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. The study identifies an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels. The results suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription, and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes. The study also shows that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues is detected primarily in the hypophosphorylated forms of RPB1, suggesting that CTD methylation is associated with early stages of the transcription cycle.
The regulation of skeletal muscle satellite cell (SC) quiescence is crucial for maintaining muscle homeostasis and facilitating muscle repair following injury. A recent study has identified the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin (TTP) as a key regulator of SC quiescence. TTP promotes the degradation of MyoD mRNA, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, by binding to its 3' untranslated region. Upon muscle injury, the p38α/β MAPK signaling pathway is activated, leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation of TTP. This results in the stabilization of MyoD mRNA, allowing SCs to exit quiescence and proliferate to repair damaged muscle tissue.

The study found that TTP is present in quiescent SCs and is rapidly inhibited by p38α/β MAPK signaling upon SC activation. TTP's role in maintaining SC quiescence is further supported by its ability to reduce the half-life of MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell-specific knockdown of TTP resulted in precocious activation of SCs, leading to inappropriate MyoD expression and aberrant cell cycle entry. This suggests that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets, including MyoD, to maintain SC quiescence.

The p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of TTP upon SC activation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, the study proposes that TTP may be involved in down-regulating MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in the reacquisition of quiescence following an injury. The regulation of mRNAs by TTP appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling SC homeostasis.

The study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis, with transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases, being highly represented. The findings suggest that TTP plays a crucial role in maintaining SC quiescence and that its dysregulation may contribute to muscle diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying TTP's role in SC quiescence and its potential as a therapeutic target for muscle diseases.
In a study on infant mice lacking the interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R), researchers investigated the role of IL10R in regulating lamina propria macrophage function during infant development and its impact on the prevention of colitis. The study found that while IL10R-deficient mice did not exhibit signs of colitis during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began to develop during the third week of life, coinciding with weaning and changes in the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Instead, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is crucial for preventing the development of murine colitis. The study also suggests that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the etiopathogenesis of infantile-onset colitis and could lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of these diseases. The study highlights the importance of IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function in maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis and preventing intestinal inflammation in infancy.
The Tudor domain protein SIMR-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of transposons and germline genes in Caenorhabditis elegans by promoting the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) at piRNA-targeted mRNAs. The piRNA pathway is a key mechanism for silencing transposons and other germline genes, and the mutator complex is responsible for synthesizing high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex were previously unknown. This study identifies SIMR-1 as a protein that acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. These findings suggest a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex. The study demonstrates that SIMR-1 is required at a step between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex, and its localization to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci implicates a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. This work identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. The piRNA silencing pathway in C. elegans involves a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the mutator complex, which synthesizes secondary downstream siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing. Several proteins have been identified in C. elegans that are required for piRNA transcription, trimming, and modification, including GLH-1, GLH-2, GLH-3, GLH-4, DDX-19, LAF-1, MUT-14, and VBH-1, which localize at or near P granules. One of these proteins could potentially serve a function similar to RDE-12, in the shuttling of piRNA-targeted mRNAs into SIMR-1 foci and ultimately to Mutator foci.
In vivo recordings of Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) have unequivocally demonstrated the existence of bistability in these neurons. Bistability refers to the ability of Purkinje neurons to switch between two distinct states: tonic firing and bursting. Tonic firing occurs at depolarized membrane potentials, while bursting occurs at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. This bistability was observed in Purkinje neurons from 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) to 19 dpf, suggesting that it is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals.

The bistability in Purkinje neurons was found to be dependent on AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated inputs from climbing fibers (CFs). Activation of AMPARs by CFs was sufficient to trigger bursts, while GABAAR or NMDAR were not required for bursting. Furthermore, the initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of CF excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and membrane depolarization.

Intracellular recordings from Purkinje neurons revealed two types of glutamatergic excitation: strong excitation from CFs and weak excitation from parallel fibers (PFs), both mediated by AMPA receptors. The bistability observed in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae is consistent with previous reports of bistability in vitro in amniotes and in vivo under anesthesia in rodents.

The findings suggest that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons across species, from fish to mammals. The ability of Purkinje neurons to switch between tonic firing and bursting modes may play a crucial role in motor learning and cerebellar function. The study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cerebellar function and motor control, and highlights the importance of AMPAR-mediated CF inputs in regulating Purkinje neuron activity.
The actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by generating force to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension. An experimentally constrained multiscale model was developed to investigate the principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during this process. The model revealed that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. Around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization, and a newly developed molecule-counting method determined that approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predicted that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit, storing elastic energy that contributes to endocytic internalization. Cryo-electron tomography confirmed the presence of bent filaments. Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. This spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints. The model also showed that actin network self-organization arising from the distribution of Hip1R around the pit and filament bending allows the endocytic actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under elevated loads. The results demonstrate that a minimal actin network composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein, with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements, is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. The study provides new insights into the principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Macropinocytosis is a cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular liquid into large vesicles called macropinosomes. This process relies on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying macropinocytic cup formation in Dictyostelium cells using lattice light sheet microscopy. They found that macropinocytic cups are organized around intense patches of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ), active Ras, and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. The formation of these patches does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and they become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, indicating that Ras plays an instructive role in their formation. The researchers propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. Macropinosomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization. The central patch of activated Ras and PIP3 is associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge, which drives a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. The F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling molecules, including active Ras. Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body. The closure of the cup can be abrupt and often involves the inward collapse of the rim. The researchers suggest that Ras activity stimulates macropinocytosis in both mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, and macropinocytic cups are associated with an intense domain of PIP3, which is essential for their function. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying macropinocytic cup formation and suggests a general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane.
The cohesin ring plays a crucial role in holding newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase in eukaryotic cell division. The initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on the Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ) complex, which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. The Scc4 protein is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide, and a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion. The structure of yeast Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2 has been determined, revealing the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establishing a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres. Using budding yeast, it has been demonstrated that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is necessary to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion. This finding shows that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. The results also suggest that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting pathway is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading in eukaryotes, as the conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is present in diverse eukaryotes. Perturbation of the conserved patch eliminates centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms. This indicates that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting pathway is essential for proper cohesin loading and chromosome segregation.
This study investigated the effects of being born late in the active season on growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival, and fecundity in juvenile garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus). The results showed that late-born (LB) juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as early-born (EB) individuals. However, LB juveniles had lower body fat content prior to hibernation compared to EB individuals. Despite this, LB juveniles showed similar patterns of hibernation, but had a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice.

The study found that torpor use was low during intensive growth, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use and reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. The results suggest that torpor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots. In garden dormice, being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history.

The study also investigated the effects of food availability on the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, use of energy-saving strategies such as daily torpor, body size and body fat content prior to hibernation, overwinter hibernating patterns and mass losses, and fecundity at the following spring of female juvenile dormice. The results showed that food availability did not affect the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, but did affect the use of daily torpor and body fat content prior to hibernation.

The study's findings are in line with previous research on common dormice, which also showed no significant differences in winter survival between EB and LB juveniles. The pre-hibernation fat reserves of LB juveniles in this study were sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to the five-week delay of hibernation start. The results also suggest that an extensive use of torpor is incompatible with structural growth, but supports pre-hibernation fattening late in the season and the preservation of the fat reserves previously deposited prior to hibernation.
The C. elegans neural editome reveals an ADAR target mRNA required for proper chemotaxis. Caenorhabditis elegans lacking ADARs exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the targets responsible for this phenotype remain unknown. To identify critical neural ADAR targets in C. elegans, an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome was performed. Development and implementation of publicly available software, SAILOR, identified 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neural editome with ADR-2 associated gene expression changes revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring clec-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. This study provides the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with SAILOR, over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome were identified, including 104 novel edited genes. Previous studies have shown that worms lacking ADR-2 exhibit defects in chemotaxis, yet the underlying mechanism has yet to be determined. To elucidate ADR-2 target mRNAs that are important for proper neural function, the neural editome was queried for genes involved in chemotaxis or locomotion. The results suggest that altered neural gene expression, rather than recoding events, is responsible for the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans ADR-2. This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs host shutoff as a strategy to repress cellular mRNA translation and facilitate the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. A systematic analysis using RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling was conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying IAV-induced host shutoff. The results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. At 8 hours post-infection (hpi), viral mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells, while 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral. This indicates that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the primary cause of host shutoff during IAV infection.

The analysis also reveals strong variability in the levels of cellular transcript reduction, with short transcripts being less affected by IAV. Notably, these refractory mRNAs are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the study shows that continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is essential for viral propagation. This suggests that IAV exploits the host cell's oxidative phosphorylation machinery to support its own replication.

The findings of this study contradict previous suggestions that direct co-opting of the translation machinery plays a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff during IAV infection. Instead, the results indicate that viral dominance over the mRNA pool is the primary mechanism underlying host shutoff. This is consistent with the notion that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production. The study's systematic and unbiased analysis provides new insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff and highlights the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in viral propagation. Overall, the results advance our understanding of IAV-induced host shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with essential housekeeping functions.
Biologists have long recognized the importance of gradients of signaling proteins in inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms of gradient formation remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers investigated the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, in Drosophila. The study found that FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium ( ASP ) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. This gradient acts as a morphogen in the ASP, activating concentration-dependent gene expression and inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. This feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient. The study reveals a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion. This mechanism provides precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time. The findings have implications for our understanding of tissue morphogenesis and the role of cytonemes in cell-to-cell communication. In Drosophila, the primary signal that guides the branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes is the FGF family protein Branchless ( Bnl ). Traditionally, FGF family proteins are thought to function as diffusible signals and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. However, the study suggests that Bnl forms a gradient through cytoneme-mediated transport rather than diffusion. The shape of the Bnl gradient can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies through the counteracting feedback activities of intracellular transcription factors Cut and PntP1, which regulate where and when signal-specific cytonemes are made as a function of the levels of signal received.
Coiled coils are the most well-understood protein fold due to their unique backbone structure, which can be described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has enabled the manipulation of coiled coils in unprecedented detail. Despite their well-characterized structure, researchers have discovered a new type of fiber formed by inserting two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil, causing the local formation of short β-strands that move the chain path by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. This novel structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.

α-helical coiled coils are ubiquitous protein domains found in various structural and functional contexts. They were the first protein fold described in atomic detail and are also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations. This has placed them at the forefront of protein design efforts. However, the understanding of insertions of 2 and 6 residues, which should cause the greatest strain on α-helical geometry, was still missing. Researchers have found that these insertions break the α-helices to form short β-strands, which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure called the β-layer.

The β-layer is found repetitively in natural coiled coils, forming regular fibers with alternating α- and β-structure. This protein fold has not been described before. The α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber based on a novel supersecondary structure element. It consists of alternating α- and β-layers, with the first β-layer being part of a 6-residue element (hexad) that occurs after a position g of the preceding heptad. The g position is biased towards a c position, yielding the same g/c position as in the structures T6 and T96. The α/β coiled coil is a substantially novel backbone structure that is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
Epsin, an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clathrin adaptor, plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To elucidate its function, researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple knockout ( KO ) mice. The results showed that triple KO cells exhibited a dramatic cell division defect and a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect was correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which was confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. The study suggests that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits. This function is distinct from other roles of epsin, such as its low-affinity interaction with SNAREs. The results indicate that epsin is essential for the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The study provides conclusive evidence about the function and sites of action of epsin in endocytosis using a gene KO strategy to completely eliminate all epsins. The findings suggest that epsin plays a critical role in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to actin in cooperation with Hip1R, which helps invaginate the pit. The study also highlights the importance of epsin in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the role of epsin in this process.
A case-control study was conducted in urban Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years. The study included 555 cases of asthma and 1115 controls. Asthma was diagnosed by study clinicians. The results showed that the main risk factors for asthma were higher parental socio-economic status, urbanicity, and area of residence at birth. Children born in small towns or cities had an increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 2.16 (95% CI: 1.60-2.92) and 2.79 (95% CI: 1.79-4.35), respectively. Additionally, a parental history of asthma, children's own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking on gas/electricity were also associated with an increased risk of asthma.

The study found a strong rural-town-city risk gradient for asthma, with the highest risk among children born in small towns and cities. This risk increased further in the presence of other asthma risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children's own atopy, higher measures of socio-economic status, and urbanicity. The study also found that even among children with no parental history of allergic disease, being born in a town or city was associated with an increased risk of asthma compared to being born in a rural area.

The study's findings suggest that the risk of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly predicted by their area of residence in early life, particularly at birth. The study provides the basis for future studies to identify specific environmental and lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the rapid urbanization in Africa and other LMICs, the prevalence of asthma is likely to increase further, highlighting the need for further research in this area.
Zebrafish pigment pattern formation is a complex process involving interactions between three types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, which encodes Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, result in a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified Cx39.4 (luchs) as the interacting component. Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that luchs is required for stripe formation in zebrafish, but the fins are almost unaffected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggesting that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these channels promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores. Fish homozygous for leotK3 or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores. Gap junctions are composed of two hemi-channels in adjacent cells, each made of six connexin subunits, which can be identical (homomeric) or different (heteromeric). A heteromeric/heterotypic gap junction is schematically shown, and an alignment of the amino acid sequence from zebrafish Cx41.8 with its human orthologue, GJA5, is provided. The transmembrane regions are shaded in grey, and newly identified point mutations in Connexin 41.8 are highlighted in red. The homozygous leotK3 phenotype is considerably stronger than this, indicating that the mutant Cx41.8 protein present in leotK3 cells has a dominant negative effect on some further component(s) involved in pigment pattern formation. A simple model suggests that this additional factor could be another connexin involved in the formation of heteromeric gap junctions together with Cx41.8. The data suggest that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions and that these channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established.
The evolution of insect olfactory receptors has been extensively studied in neopteran insects, but the identity of receptors involved in olfaction in more ancient apterygote and paleopteran insects remains unknown. A recent study investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium (Phasmatodea). The results suggest that olfactory receptors (ORs) and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are lacking in Lepismachilis, but are present in Thermobia and Phyllium. In Thermobia, three Orco candidates were identified, while Phyllium has a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. The study proposes that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs. The evolution of the coreceptor Orco is thought to have occurred after the bristletails split from their last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies on both ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings. Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco. The study suggests that the early evolution of the insect olfactory system can be studied by examining species at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile chemicals. The selected species, including Lepismachilis, Thermobia, and Phyllium, provide an excellent model for understanding the evolution of the insect olfactory system. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the evolution of olfactory receptors in insects and provide insights into the early evolution of the insect olfactory system.
The global malaria burden has decreased over the last decade, with many nations attempting to eliminate the disease. However, asymptomatic malaria infections pose a significant challenge to these efforts, as they often go undiagnosed and untreated. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as a solution to this problem, but its effectiveness depends on adequate population participation. A recent study conducted in Myanmar investigated the potential herd protection against Plasmodium falciparum infections conferred by MDA. The study analyzed data from four villages undergoing MDA and found that individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation. This suggests a herd effect, where the protection provided by MDA extends beyond individual participants to the broader population. The study also found that high mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may hinder elimination efforts. The study's findings provide evidence for a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria, which has not been previously documented. The results suggest that MDA can provide additional levels of population protection beyond individual treatment, making it a valuable tool in the fight against malaria. The study's findings have important implications for further research, intervention, and policy work in malaria control and elimination efforts.
The study investigated the conservation of transcription factor (TF) binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution by comparing the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs to human and mouse data. The analysis revealed a striking level of conservation of TF binding specificity between Drosophila and mammals, with fruit flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans. This conservation extended to secondary modes of binding and even subtle dinucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. The study used high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX) to determine TF binding specificities in Drosophila melanogaster and compared them to human and mouse data. The results showed that orthologous TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding, even though these species diverged over 600 million years ago. This suggests that TF binding specificities are highly conserved across evolution. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, indicating that evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. The study provides new insights into the evolution of TF DNA-binding characteristics and sheds light on the role of divergence and subtle drift in TF DNA binding specificity in animal diversity.
The study presents a novel approach to recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary co-development using simultaneous multilineage differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). A stepwise strategy was employed to direct the induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of hiPSCs via temporal-specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. This approach resulted in the formation of concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs) that effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs upon withdrawal of the WNT agonist.

In 3D suspension culture, the cardio-pulmonary μTs exhibited expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. The cardiac lineage was found to be an essential cellular niche that promoted effective alveolar maturation. The study demonstrated that upon co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm, a series of shared signaling events drove simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. The co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors were then transitioned to 3D suspension culture, where they exhibited rapid alveolar maturation within 3 days, supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage.

The cardio-pulmonary μTs were found to segregate into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs upon withdrawal of the WNT agonist, with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. This study provides an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis. The model offers a novel approach for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation. Further investigation is required to elucidate the morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages, as well as their crosstalk during this process.
The study reveals an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a response to changes in selective pressure. Contrary to the general assumption that mutation rates are a slowly-evolving parameter, the research demonstrates that E. coli can rapidly adjust its mutation rate to adapt to stressful environments. Specifically, the study shows that hypermutation, a condition characterized by an increased mutation rate, arises independently in different E. coli cultures when they are exposed to high ethanol stress. Furthermore, the study finds that hypermutator states are transitory and repeatedly alternate with decreases in mutation rate as the cells adapt to the stressful environment.

The study used a defined collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates to identify a range of optimal mutation rates that enable rapid growth under high ethanol stress. Experimental evolution revealed an essential role for hypermutation in de novo adaptation to high ethanol stress. The results show that population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted to the stress. Interestingly, the study identifies cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates.

The findings provide new insights into the dynamics of mutation rate evolution and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. The study sheds light on how organisms balance robustness and evolvability, suggesting that maintaining high mutation rates is limited in time. The research also highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying changes in mutation rate, which remains a largely fragmentary area of knowledge. Overall, the study demonstrates that E. coli can rapidly adjust its mutation rate to adapt to stressful environments, providing new perspectives on the evolution of mutation rates in response to selective pressure.
SnRK1-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization mediates the low-energy response in plants. The low-energy response is a critical adaptation mechanism that allows organisms to survive under changing environmental conditions by balancing growth and defense responses. The AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are evolutionary conserved metabolic master regulators that act at two levels: modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes and massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. This study identifies the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response and a direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changes its dimerization preference, affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibits starvation-related phenotypes, which can be functionally complemented by wild-type bZIP63 but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. The SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function is underlined by complementation of the bzip63 mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. Wild-type bZIP63, but not a S29/S294/S300A mutant of bZIP63, can complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes. The study also shows that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that it is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner. SnRK1 targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63. The phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta, and a molecular model is proposed for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.
The study identifies ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) as a novel synaptonuclear messenger that encodes activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the hippocampus. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. It is enriched at excitatory synapses, where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. This process involves importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines. RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and undergoes importin-dependent long-distance transport to the nucleus. The intracellular C-terminal domain of GluN2A contains target sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules, including RNF10 and calmodulin. RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines after specific synaptic stimuli and is required for postsynaptic modifications needed to convey LTP induction. The study suggests that impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling, rather than a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels, is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing. The findings indicate that the NMDAR complex is a rich source of protein messengers capable of trafficking to the nucleus and encoding synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals. Activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to an increase in RNF10 nuclear localization. The study describes a novel synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway that specifically links activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs to nuclear gene expression. RNF10 is highly expressed in the nucleus as well as at synapses, where it directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs.
Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are a family of enzymes that remodel protein-DNA complexes to regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic state during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. The single-subunit remodeler Mot1, which dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, has been used as a model system to study the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) has been determined at 3.8 Å resolution. The structure shows that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data indicate that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex. The interface between Mot1 and NC2 is small, but the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix H5 from TBP and H4 from DNA. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein-DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. The association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. The study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex, offering insights into the structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1.
The article describes the discovery of synthetic variants of the natural product ternatin, a cyclic peptide with cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic properties. Ternatin and its variants were found to be up to 500-fold more potent than the original compound in inhibiting cancer cell growth. Using a photo-affinity probe, the researchers identified the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target of ternatin and its variants. This complex plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, and the binding of ternatin to this complex was found to be competitive with other natural products, including didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A were shown to prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, suggesting that the adjacent hydrophobic surface is a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. The study demonstrates that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products. Ternatin and its variants were found to inhibit cellular protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. Photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA, highlighting the specificity of ternatin binding to this complex. Two structurally unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin, were also found to compete with ternatin for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. The study suggests that ternatins may be attractive leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis.
The study investigated the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating in Lowe syndrome cells. Lowe syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the OCRL gene, which encodes an inositol 5-phosphatase that interacts directly with clathrin. Previous studies have primarily attributed the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome to intracellular sorting defects. However, this study reveals that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. The cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from the sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. The study found that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. The absence of OCRL in patient cells delays endocytosis by stalling late-stage pits, impairs uncoating, and triggers the nucleation of comets from clathrin vesicles that retain PI(4,5)P2 and fail to uncoat. These findings indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations. The study suggests that OCRL participates in uncoating and facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. The presence of numerous actin comets driven by clathrin-positive vesicles in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts adds further support to a close relationship between endocytic clathrin coats and actin.
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer (CRC), with aberrant activation contributing to tumorigenesis. However, identifying effective Wnt inhibitors for cancer treatment remains a significant challenge. Recent research has shed light on the regulation of this pathway, revealing a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory circuit in intestinal tumorigenesis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), elevated in adenomas of APCmin/+ mice and human CRC tissues, function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) at tyrosine 216 (Y216). This phosphorylation event reinforces pathway output, leading to β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis.

Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using PF-562271 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, accompanied by reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin. These findings indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. The intestinal level of p-GSK3βY216 was significantly higher in APCmin/+ mice than in control mice, and PF-562271 treatment greatly suppressed GSK3βY216 phosphorylation and GSK3β ubiquitination, further supporting the role of FAK/PYK2 kinase in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

Loss of functional adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) induces the expression of FAK and PYK2, which in turn phosphorylate GSK3βY216 to stabilize β-catenin, initiating and supporting intestinal tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was first discovered two decades ago, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. The current study demonstrates that FAK and PYK2 function redundantly in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells, raising the possibility that FAK and PYK2 could also function redundantly in Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. However, intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone was sufficient to cause complete abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mutant mice, suggesting that FAK and PYK2 may have distinct roles in intestinal tumorigenesis.
The neural control of transitions between posture and movement involves the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. To investigate this process, researchers examined the continuity of vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli ( EVS ). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Results showed discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These findings indicate that humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies as predicted by optimal feedback theory. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. To transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted, and the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. This suspension occurs while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset. The suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. This approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control.
In cyanobacteria, the circadian output pathway plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic programs in response to light availability. The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect and found that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night.

The rpaA- strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic, but not in constant light environments, suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light/dark cycles. The phosphorylated form of RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy charge and a severe reduction in fitness.

Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. The study highlights how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations. The results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment. The study suggests that functional circadian output mediated by the activity of RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day, as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk. These metabolic adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy production and sustain cell viability during periods of darkness that challenge and constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth.
P-type ATPases, specifically the PIB-4 subclass, play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by transporting transition metals across cellular membranes. These proteins are essential for detoxification and redistribution of ions such as zinc, copper, and cobalt. However, the structure and ion-release mechanism of PIB-4-ATPases have remained elusive due to the lack of available structural information. To address this knowledge gap, researchers have determined the structure of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1, and conducted complementary functional analyses. The results reveal that PIB-4-ATPases lack classical heavy-metal-binding domains ( HMBDs ) and display an eight-helix M-domain configuration. This topology is distinct from other P-type ATPases and provides new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that PIB-4-ATPases have a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. Additionally, the researchers found that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium-independent, contrasting with many other P-type ATPases. These findings have significant implications for drug discovery and the development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants. The study also highlights the potential of PIB-4-ATPases as virulence factors in many pathogens. The metal specificity of PIB-4-ATPases remains unclear, with some members exhibiting cobalt specificity while others transport a broader range of ions, including zinc, nickel, copper, and calcium. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into the structure and function of PIB-4-ATPases and their role in heavy-metal homeostasis.
In mammals, numerous autosomal genes exhibit mitotically stable monoallelic expression ( MAE ), a phenomenon where one allele of a gene is expressed while the other is silenced. Despite its significance in various human diseases, the regulation of MAE has been challenging to study due to its clonal nature. Researchers have now identified a chromatin signature that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with high accuracy. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of chromatin marks associated with active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and silencing ( H3K27me3 ) in the gene body. The MAE signature is found in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across different cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This discovery opens up a new approach to studying MAE that is independent of polymorphisms and suggests a link between MAE and cell differentiation. The MAE signature was detected in a variety of cell types, with up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showing the chromatin signature of MAE. This approach does not rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) or sample clonality, making it feasible to analyze MAE in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. The genes with the MAE chromatin signature share some pronounced features as a group. Importantly, the MAE identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in a polyclonal sample. A large fraction of known bivalent genes acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher than other genes that are also silent in embryonic stem cells. These master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature upon activation.
The study reveals a novel mechanism of activity control for the AAA+ chaperone ClpC in Gram-positive bacteria. ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies through head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains ( MDs ), which sequester ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state. This resting state restricts substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. The adaptor protein MecA activates ClpC by binding to MD interaction sites, converting the resting state to an active planar ring structure. ClpC is essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance as part of the ClpCP protease complex. The study shows that loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. The findings suggest that coiled-coil MDs are regulatory devices controlling AAA+ protein activity. This mechanism is distinct from other AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpB/Hsp104, where coiled-coil MDs form a repressing belt around the AAA ring to reduce ATPase activity. Instead, ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules in a helical conformation. The formation of this structure involves ATP binding to AAA domains and restricts substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. Mutating a key regulatory MD residue of ClpE also causes cellular toxicity, suggesting that the repressing mode of MDs is a general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems. Severe toxicity of ClpC and ClpE MD mutants qualifies these AAA+ chaperones as targets for antimicrobials. The study provides new insights into the regulation of AAA+ chaperones and highlights the importance of coiled-coil MDs in controlling their activity.
In Drosophila, adult muscle precursors (AMPs) are a type of muscle stem cell that emerges during mid-embryogenesis and remains dormant throughout embryonic and most of larval life. AMPs express muscle progenitor-specific markers, such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist, and can proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts for adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles. However, the mechanisms that keep AMPs in a non-differentiated quiescent state and how they are reactivated remain poorly understood. To address this, researchers used a Drosophila model to investigate the behavior of AMPs in vivo. They found that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Genetic analyses revealed that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs, leading to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. The data suggest that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs. Furthermore, the researchers found that dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation and that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates. The study provides evidence that muscle behaves as an AMP niche and plays a driving role in AMP reactivation in later larval life. The Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade was found to be essential for AMP reactivation and proliferation, and genetic rescue experiments showed that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch. Overall, the study reveals new features of Drosophila AMPs, including their direct contact with muscles and the role of the muscle niche in AMP reactivation.
Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons are a type of GABAergic neuron that fire spontaneously at high rates, providing tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but the molecular basis of this current has remained poorly understood. To identify the molecular basis of this current, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. The study found that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. NALCN is also involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN. The researchers used whole transcriptome sequencing of SNr neurons and detected expression of several nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) that could potentially generate the tonic depolarizing current. NALCN stood out as a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current in these cells, as it had the highest expression of all NSCCs and its expression was in the top 20% of all ion channels. The study also found that SNr neurons express Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155a, three genes whose protein products are known to interact with NALCN. These findings suggest that NALCN plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tonic activity in SNr neurons and that disruption of NALCN could contribute to basal ganglia-related motor disorders. The study highlights the importance of NALCN in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability and its potential role in the pathophysiology of motor disorders.
Scientists have long relied on antibiotics derived from a limited number of culturable microorganisms to combat bacterial infections. However, the emergence of antibiotic resistance has rendered these compounds increasingly ineffective, while the vast majority of microbial diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. To address this challenge, researchers have developed a novel droplet-based microscale cultivation system that combines high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity with in-droplet cultivation of single cells. This innovative approach enables the cultivation of previously uncultured species and significantly increases bacterial diversity compared to traditional agar plate cultivation. The system consists of a modular droplet-microfluidic platform that mimics environmental conditions in situ, allowing for the cultivation of 2 million compartmentalized single cells in a total volume of 1. 5 mL. Each droplet has a miniaturized volume of 200 pL, facilitating high-density long-term cultivation. The system is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity, which involves the addition of reporter strains to the cultivation compartments. This allows for the detection and selection of droplets containing environmental cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by culturing a complex bacterial community derived from a soil sample and comparing the results to classical agar plate cultivation. One isolate that showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening was selected for further analysis, and the secreted metabolites were identified and characterized. The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis through a highly robust reporter assay streamlines efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics. Even though axenic cultures of putative new species could not be maintained with standard microbiological cultivation after isolation from droplets, the cells could be used for obtaining high-quality genome information.
A Bayesian analysis was conducted to investigate the association between the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) genotype and survival in patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Previous studies have shown that adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality from TBM by approximately 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology contributes to only a subset of deaths. The LTA4H gene encodes an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids, and a C/T promoter variant has been linked to increased survival in patients with TBM. However, a study in Indonesia did not find a survival benefit associated with the LTA4H TT genotype. Using Bayesian methods to analyze both studies, the authors found that the LTA4H TT genotype confers a survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. The results suggest that LTA4H genotyping, combined with disease severity assessment, may be used to target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. The authors propose that personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment may be warranted, with the drug given only to TT patients. They also suggest that the lack of an LTA4H genotype association with survival in the Indonesia cohort may be due to the underlying association being overridden by severe disease, or that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype are nullified in more severe disease.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand how growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating the role of shootin1 in mediating netrin-1–induced axon guidance. The study found that knockout mice of shootin1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of netrin-1 knockout mice. This suggests that shootin1 plays a crucial role in axon guidance, particularly in response to netrin-1 gradients.

    The study demonstrated that shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicit highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. This phosphorylation increases shootin1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM, promoting F-actin–adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Furthermore, the spatially regulated shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients.

    The study also showed that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that Shootin1 knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons. Notably, very small spatial differences in netrin-1 concentration elicited highly polarized directional phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones. Netrin-1–elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promoted direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, thereby generating traction force for growth cone motility.

    The study further demonstrated that disturbance of the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibited axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients. Additionally, uncoupling of F-actin-adhesion coupling by shootin1a ( 1-125 ) inhibited netrin-1–induced axon outgrowth and turning on laminin. These findings indicate that netrin-1–induced axon guidance, mediated by the shootin1a–L1-CAM interaction, is not limited to growth cones on L1-CAM.

    Overall, the study has identified a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrated that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying netrin-1–regulated axon guidance and highlight the importance of shootin1 in this process.
The study of hummingbirds’ unique ability to produce a distinct humming sound while in flight has long been a topic of interest in the scientific community. To elucidate the biophysical origin of this phenomenon, researchers employed a novel approach combining acoustic nearfield holography and direct measurement of 3D aerodynamic forces using an aerodynamic force platform. The study involved six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds, which were equipped with a 2176-microphone array to record their acoustic nearfield and a force platform to measure the aerodynamic forces generated by their flapping wings.

    The researchers developed an idealized acoustic model that integrated the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, demonstrating how the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. The study found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of flapping wings in both birds and insects originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their body weight. Furthermore, the model analysis revealed that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder.

    The researchers employed a new aerodynamic force platform to directly measure the net 3D aerodynamic force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds, which was then integrated into a new aeroacoustics model to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings. The measurements and model showed that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum, with the broadband acoustic pressure primarily oriented downward opposing gravity. The acoustic directivity and orientation of the harmonic components depend on harmonic parity.

    The study also compared the predicted acoustic field with novel acoustic nearfield recordings for six freely hovering hummingbirds, which corroborated the predictive power of the minimal model. Numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation showed that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation. The findings suggest that oscillating aerodynamic forces play a crucial role in generating the wing hum of both birds and insects, providing new insights into the complex bioacoustic behavior of these animals.
Title: Contingency and Chance Erase Necessity in the Experimental Evolution of Ancestral Proteins

    A recent study investigated the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in the evolution of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins. By combining ancestral protein reconstruction and a novel continuous evolution technology, the researchers were able to mutate and select proteins to acquire specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. The study found that over long historical timescales, contingency generated by sequence change steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation.

    The researchers replicated evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins and found that trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, even under strong and identical selection pressures. This suggests that chance arose because many sets of mutations could alter specificity at any timepoint, while contingency arose because historical substitutions changed these sets. The results indicate that patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences, and likely other proteins as well, are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events.

    The study's findings suggest that present-day BCL-2 family proteins are largely physical anecdotes of their particular unpredictable histories, with their sequences reflecting the interaction of accumulated chance events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection. The results also indicate that contingency generated by sequence change over phylogenetic timescales plays a profound role in BCL-2 family protein sequence evolution under laboratory selection for new functions.

    The study used human BID and NOXA as fixed binding partners, but in real evolution, these proteins would have varied in sequence as well, introducing opportunities for chance and contingency to further affect the sequence outcomes of BCL-2 evolution. However, some differences between the study's design and the biological setting of historical BCL-2 family evolution could have overestimated chance's historical role.

    The results indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical PPI specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family's history, even during intervals when the proteins' PPI binding profiles did not evolve. This suggests that for chance to strongly influence the outcomes of adaptive evolution, multiple paths to a selected phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities of being taken.
A genome-wide haplotype-based analysis was conducted on a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups to characterize the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in the region. The study revealed that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. Furthermore, most sub-Saharan populations were found to share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. These findings provide insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The study also identified clear evidence for the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over various timescales. This is supported by previous studies such as the African Genome Variation Project, which described the influence of both Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa. However, questions remain regarding the extent and timing of key events and their impact on contemporary populations. At finer scales, the analysis revealed smaller groups and often differentiated closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. Gene-flow between populations was measured and related to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa. Admixture is increasingly regarded as a common feature of human populations across the globe, and genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent’s history and its impact on genetic diversity. The study provides a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups and identifies the dominant events that have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa.
During Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions to ensure proper cell division. To investigate this process, an in vitro system was established using cytoplasmic extracts from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 ( 4 cells, 37 µm ) and stage 8 ( ∼4000 cells, 18 µm ). The kinesin-13 kif2a was identified as a driver of developmental spindle scaling, whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. This ratiometric mechanism controls microtubule destabilization and couples spindle size to cell size during Xenopus development. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Reconstituting spindle formation in embryo extracts enabled the elucidation of a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size through differential activation of the kinesin-13 kif2a. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development and suggests that physical changes in embryonic cell size can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture. Importin α phosphorylation is thought to liberate it from membrane stores into the cytoplasm, thereby promoting its transport activity. Kif2a was found to retrieve ∼10 times more importin α from stage 3 extracts than from stage 8 extracts, suggesting that the amount of importin α partitioning to membrane is sufficient to alter its interaction with kif2a. The identification of a mechanism contributing to spindle size control in embryos enabled the testing of its functional significance during development, revealing an important role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early Xenopus development. This work suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.
The discovery of tandem riboswitch aptamers in bacteria has revealed a natural Boolean logic gate that controls purine metabolism. Riboswitch aptamers are RNA molecules that bind to specific ligands to regulate gene expression. In this study, researchers identified riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) that exist in either singlet or tandem arrangements with guanine aptamers. The tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind their target ligands independently or in combination to approximate the function of an IMPLY Boolean logic gate. This gate regulates the transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. The existence of these sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed complex metabolic states without protein regulatory factors.

    The researchers used in-line probing experiments to examine the aptamer regions of the RNA and found that the logic gate function is accomplished through interactions between the two aptamers and the adjoining expression platform. The terminator and antiterminator stems are stabilized or destabilized depending on the relative concentrations of both guanine and PRPP. This is the first example of two tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities that share the same expression platform, allowing for a new type of logic function to be implemented.

    Tandem riboswitch systems have been previously described, but the guanine-PRPP system is unique in its ability to implement a two-input Boolean logic gate. The discovery of this system demonstrates the complexity of chemical sensing and regulatory functions in ancient RNA World organisms. It is likely that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates will be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells.

    The researchers suggest that RNA aptamers that selectively bound PRPP in ancient times might have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells. The discovery of tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitches serves as an additional demonstration of how complex molecular devices can be formed purely from RNA. The in vitro transcription data for the logic gate molecules represent the combined output of a population of RNA transcripts.
The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of synaptic transmission. The variability in this fundamental property contributes to the diversity of synaptic function across different brain regions. However, the source of this variability remains unclear. The prevailing view suggests that the release of a single vesicle ( univesicular release, UVR ) or multiple vesicles ( multivesicular release, MVR ) is determined by the probability of vesicle release, which is influenced by calcium levels. However, a recent study using mouse brain slices has demonstrated that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool ( RRP ), which is upstream of vesicle release probability. The RRP is controlled by protein kinase A ( PKA ) and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, which dynamically regulate release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control MVR and contribute to the functional diversity of synaptic signaling. The study suggests that the size of the RRP is a key determinant of the number of vesicles released, and that PKA and synapsin play a crucial role in regulating this process. The results have important implications for our understanding of synaptic function and the development of unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters. The study also highlights the need to consider the RRP as a fundamental synaptic parameter that contributes to the variability in vesicle release mode. The findings are consistent with recent release models that propose that vesicles transition between sequential states, from loose to tighter tethering with release machinery followed by calcium-triggered fusion. The study provides new evidence that the RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, which is under the control of synapsins and constrains the number of vesicles released. The results suggest that the size of the RRP is a key determinant of the number of vesicles released, and that PKA and synapsin play a crucial role in regulating this process. The study highlights the importance of considering the RRP as a fundamental synaptic parameter that contributes to the variability in vesicle release mode.

HIV-1 Gag is responsible for the selective packaging of the viral RNA genome in the context of a large excess of cytosolic human RNAs. To investigate this process, researchers used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag, and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. The results showed that Gag selectively packages the HIV-1 5' UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA.

The study found that mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag, which subtly affect its self-assembly on membranes, abrogate RNA selectivity. Additionally, it was observed that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. These findings suggest that the ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are interdependent on one another.

The researchers propose a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA. According to this model, a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA. This model is supported by the observation that the large majority of plasma membrane-proximal genomic HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag, but coalesce to dimers on the membrane in the presence of Gag.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. The results suggest that lattice contacts conferring Gag ability to multimerize on a membrane are crucial for the selective packaging of viral RNA. The 5' UTR is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without any gross changes to its secondary structure, and the association of Gag with tRNA serves to inhibit genome-less virus assembly.
