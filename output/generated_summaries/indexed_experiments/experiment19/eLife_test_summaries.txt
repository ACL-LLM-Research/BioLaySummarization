This study investigated the molecular and structural organization of electrical synapses in the zebrafish Mauthner cells. Electrical synapses are characterized by the presence of gap junctions, which are clusters of intercellular channels that allow for direct cell-to-cell communication. However, it is unclear whether additional cellular structures contribute to electrical transmission. The researchers used expansion microscopy to examine the synaptic contacts between Mauthner cells in larval zebrafish, where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. The results showed that most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. The study revealed that electrical synapses operate with multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. This organization is distinct from chemical synapses, which have structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components. The findings provide new insights into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses and will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes. The study's results suggest that electrical synapses may be more complex than previously thought, with multiple gap junctions and associated structures contributing to their function. This has implications for our understanding of how neurons communicate with each other and how electrical synapses are organized in the nervous system.
The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), a primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to the facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, researchers used optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to selectively photoinhibit these neurons and examine their effects on mystacial pad activity and breathing. The results showed that photoinhibition of these neurons affected mystacial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing, and these effects were altered by the type of anesthetic employed and between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also sent collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of autonomic activity. The study demonstrated that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases. The results suggest that preBötC→7n neurons are likely transmitting respiratory rhythm, rather than generating it, and that selective photoinhibition of these neurons modulates orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity. The study used a combinatorial viral transgenic approach to selectively transduce and photoinhibit preBötC facial premotor neurons, which affected mystacial pad activity while minimally affecting breathing. The selective approach resulted in a smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors, and may provide insights into the development and progression of diseases associated with abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, a study examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. The results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. The study suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat, thereby promoting active defensive behaviors. Optogenetic inhibition of CGRP neurons during robot chasing resulted in reduced freezing and fleeing in animals compared to the control group. CGRP neurons, known for relaying US information to the forebrain and inducing passive freezing behavior, were examined to explore their role in active defensive responses. Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels, the study found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing, and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing, demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses. However, under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat. The study employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals, thereby incorporating an imminent threat. The results suggest that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat.
The study investigated the relationship between obesity and human brain structure using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biobank participants. The researchers tested the hypothesis that obesity, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. The results showed significant associations between obesity and two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF-WHR system was found to co-locate with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. In contrast, the ICVF-WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. The study also estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9×10−4), as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (P < 0.05). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation. Furthermore, the study found that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density, and that the ISOVF-WHR and ICVF-WHR maps were negatively correlated (r = -0.366, P = 2.3×10−13). The study also used genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and found that WHR had a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. Finally, the study used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors to investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF, and found that both ISOVF and ICVF were significantly and mostly positively correlated with WHR in brain systems.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to facilitate metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer has been uncertain due to the lack of direct evidence in human tumour specimens. A previous study identified EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin as markers that can identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This study aimed to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. The researchers examined over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours and found a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to predict metastasis, achieving a cross-validated accuracy of 87-89%. The study observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, which were highly predictive of metastatic disease. The presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma was strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. Using an image-based machine learning approach, the researchers demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs. Importantly, the retention of EpCAM alongside Vimentin and CD24 was necessary to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlated with metastasis. The study's ability to examine the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours enabled the identification of single disseminating EMT CSCs and the training of an ANN to predict metastasis. The combination of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin as markers for EMT CSCs accurately distinguished EMT from epithelial tumour cells and identified tumour cells that had undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region.
Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that play a crucial role in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. This study used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds and human diabetic foot wounds. The results show that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Notably, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. In mouse wounds, Axl is upregulated in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These findings highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provide potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. The study also provides an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. The results show that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways are upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, the data show that efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair. The study also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds.
The article describes a novel genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM) that enables the in vivo tagging of defined cell populations in Drosophila. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, allowing the barcode sequence to be read out during single-cell sequencing. By creating multiple independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables the positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, the identification of multiplet droplets, and the barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, the article demonstrates that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. This approach has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. The TaG-EM method takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila and provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. The genetic barcodes can also be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements, making TaG-EM a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms. However, the article notes that TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data, and the strength of the Gal4 driver may contribute to the labeling density. Despite this limitation, TaG-EM has the potential to revolutionize the field of single-cell transcriptomics and enable new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function.
In the family Dendrobatidae, poison frogs have evolved the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, previous studies have been biased towards colorful species, neglecting inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. This has resulted in an incomplete understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group. A new study provides data showing that species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. The study confirms that these frogs regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. The data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Instead, the study proposes the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration, known as passive accumulation. Passive accumulation differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. The study discusses the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. An evolutionary model is proposed that incorporates ideas from pharmacokinetics and data from poison frogs to explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals. The model suggests that passive accumulation is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae and possibly in related taxa, and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense. The study also highlights the need for further research on the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of chemical defense in poison frogs and has implications for our understanding of the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals.
Biomedical researchers have identified ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) as a crucial factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) processes in breast cancer. Using a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the study found that RiBi is transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET. This upregulation of RiBi is mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling pathways, which are essential for the completion of EMT/MET. Furthermore, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells, suggesting that targeting the RiBi pathway may be a promising strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.

The study employed a unique EMT-lineage-tracing model to investigate the role of RiBi in EMT/MET. The results showed that RiBi activity is higher in epithelial tumor cells than in mesenchymal tumor cells. Additionally, the study found that combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies.

The researchers also analyzed scRNA-seq data from primary tumor cells of two breast cancer patients and found that RiBi activity is associated with the EMT status of tumor cells. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that targeting the RiBi pathway with an RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics.

The findings of this study suggest that targeting the RiBi pathway may be a novel approach for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis in breast cancer. The study's results provide new insights into the role of RiBi in EMT/MET and highlight the potential of RiBi inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.
The study investigated the impact of seedling root traits on plant establishment in challenging environments, with a focus on pearl millet, a heat and drought-tolerant cereal crop widely cultivated in the sub-Saharan Sahel region. The researchers hypothesized that pearl millet’s early root system, characterized by a single fast-growing primary root, is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, they demonstrated that early drought stress is a significant constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel, where pearl millet was domesticated. Field experiments showed that increased primary root growth in pearl millet is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance. Genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identified genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Further analysis of one of these regions revealed a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9, as a potential candidate regulator of root growth. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog, AtROXY19, revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin gene clade in regulating cell elongation. The study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment. Field experiments showed that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet. Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress. The results support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation. A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait. Further analysis of this region identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9, as a potential candidate regulator of root growth. However, the effect of the polymorphisms in the promoter on gene expression needs to be tested to validate this hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that changes in PgGRXC9 expression level are responsible for a change in root growth, the researchers studied its ortholog in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
The study investigated the neural representation of concrete and abstract concepts in the brain during real-world processing, specifically during movie watching. It was found that across different contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, when multimodal context is considered, these differences are reduced, and the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. The study highlights the role of visual context in modulating the neural representation of abstract and concrete words, and suggests that similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities. The findings indicate that brain activation underlying concrete and abstract conceptual processing fundamentally changes as a function of visual context, and that representations associated with concrete or abstract conceptual processing in the brain change as a function of context. The study supports the idea that the human brain is adept at integrating information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences. The results have implications for our understanding of how words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing, and suggest that the neurobiological organisation of concepts is dynamic and context-dependent.
The development of cancer immunotherapy has been hindered by the limited availability of targetable antigens on the surface of tumor cells. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a cellular pathway that conceals neoantigens by degrading the RNA products of genes harboring truncating mutations. A high-throughput screen was conducted to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells, which implicated the disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led to the design of a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, which was shown to elevate the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Furthermore, KVS0001 increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. Inhibition of NMD with KVS0001 at concentrations as low as 600 nM resulted in the equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near-total blockade of the NMD pathway. Western blotting showed that KVS0001 substantially decreased the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines. Additionally, treatment of cancer cell lines with a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11, resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, similar to KVS0001. However, SMG1i-11 was highly insoluble, whereas KVS0001 was a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that was soluble and could easily be administered to mice. The development of KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.
This study investigated the relationship between Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) and the risk of cancer in a cohort of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. PhenoAge is a measure of biological age calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, while PhenoAgeAccel represents the rate of aging acceleration. The researchers found that PhenoAgeAccel was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women compared to biologically younger participants. Furthermore, a joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared to those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge.

The study also found that PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors, indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle may retard the aging process. Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer, even after adjusting for chronological age. This suggests that PhenoAge may be a useful indicator of biological age and a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction.

The researchers stratified the analysis by genetic risk category and found that older PhenoAge was significantly associated with a higher incident cancer risk across genetic risk groups. Among participants at high genetic risk, the standardized 5-year incident cancer rates were 5.78% and 4.58% for biologically younger men and women, respectively, compared to 6.90% and 5.17% for those older. These findings indicate that PhenoAge may be a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age and a useful tool for cancer risk assessment. The study's results are consistent with previous research that has investigated the associations between biological age and cancer risk, suggesting that different measures of biological age may reflect different aspects of aging and could be jointly applied in cancer risk assessment.
The Biome mobile app, launched in Japan, has collected over 6 million species observations since 2019, utilizing species identification algorithms and gamification elements to engage the public in biodiversity data collection. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases, which can impact the accuracy of species distribution models ( SDMs ). This study investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance. The results showed that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90% for seed plants, molluscs, and fishes. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required over 2000 records for accurate models, while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. The study suggests that establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) are effective statistical tools for assessing biodiversity at specific sites while accounting for biases in survey efforts. SDMs use species occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate the potential geographic ranges and suitable habitats for species. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs, with the most accurate model predictions obtained when the training data consisted of 50–70% Biome data. This highlights the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions.
The present study investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development. Using genetic mouse models, the researchers found that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were observed in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. The study provides solid in vivo evidence that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs. The study demonstrates that mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis. The pathological phenotype observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.
The study investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity in living cells. Using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, the researchers visualized both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. The results showed that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains. However, the degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), the EGFR effector that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2.

The study found that artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation also decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. These findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated.

Super-resolution microscopy revealed that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 form nanodomains that partially overlap before EGF stimulation. The nanodomains also form domain clusters, and the extent of coaggregation of EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 molecules in a higher-order domain structure decreases after EGF stimulation. The study suggests that the local PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EGFR autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in the deactivation of EGFR. The results indicate that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environments regulates EGFR activity.
Stramenopiles are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. Unlike most eukaryotes, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis pathway, where the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. In Blastocystis, a mitochondrial carrier has been identified that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate, which are typically transported by the human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) and dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10). Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, including complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. The glycolytic intermediate carrier identified in Blastocystis represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. This carrier is unique to stramenopiles and is not found in other eukaryotes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The discovery of this carrier provides new insights into the carbon and energy metabolism of stramenopiles and highlights the importance of mitochondrial glycolysis in these organisms.
A new framework for human genetic association studies has been proposed, which utilizes a deep learning model to calculate a functional genomic activity score for each haplotype in an individual. This score, known as the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), replaces the original genotype in association studies. The HFS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. The HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability. Additionally, the integration of HFS prediction scores with SNP-based polygenic risk scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression showed an improvement of 16.1–39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. The results demonstrate that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods. The study suggests that the HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits. The HFS framework has several compelling features, including improved causal loci and gene identification, biological interpretation, and polygenic prediction. Compared to other functionally aware fine-mapping methods, HFS-based SUSIE detected more causal signals for each trait. The HFS framework was applied to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB British ancestry training set, identifying 16,597 significant HFS-trait associations at a threshold of p < 5 × 10−8. The study concludes that the HFS is a valuable tool for genetic association studies and has the potential to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.
The current study investigated the impact of three different types of 3-month mental training modules on hippocampal organization and stress regulation in 332 healthy adults. The training modules focused on either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills. The researchers used a combination of longitudinal structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) connectivity analysis to evaluate changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity. The study also examined the relationship between these changes and diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. The results showed that only the socio-affective training module, which cultivated compassion and care, was associated with an increase in hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume, along with corresponding alterations in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output. In contrast, the attention-based and socio-cognitive training modules did not produce significant changes in hippocampal subfield volume or cortisol levels. The observed increases in CA1-3 volumes following socio-affective mental training were small-sized effects, but were consistent when independently assessing the left and right hippocampus subfields. Furthermore, the study found that training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Additionally, a multivariate approach revealed that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, the study provides evidence for a link between a socio-emotional behavioral intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. The findings suggest that socio-affective training may be a promising approach for reducing stress and promoting hippocampal plasticity.
The study investigated local adaptation in three species of sunflowers (Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris) using genome-wide association studies. Local adaptation refers to the process by which populations become better suited to their environment through genetic changes. The researchers found evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This suggests that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion.

The study estimated the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype, which is related to the genotypic redundancy. The results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci.

The researchers explored the repeatability of local adaptation in the three sunflower species, which harbour large regions of suppressed recombination (haploblocks), most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits. Most of the sunflower inversions are greater than 1 million years old, and therefore predate any current local adaptation patterns, but likely do not predate the genes underlying local adaptation, which appear to be shared among the species studied.

The results suggest that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability, which tends to be enriched within genomic regions where there exist inversions in at least one species, while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions. The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive.
The study investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a bilayer of two distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. These cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. The researchers generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger and older women. The results showed that aging leads to substantial stereotypical changes in mammary luminal epithelia, characterized by age-dependent directional changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance. This increased variance contributed to a genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity, particularly in luminal epithelial cells. The study also found that age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Furthermore, the expression of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. The study suggests that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility. The results demonstrate how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. The study highlights the importance of lineage-specific analyses in unraveling the mechanisms underlying tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging. The findings propose that increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals, which could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes.
The study aimed to investigate the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance in field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) using non-target reads from whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing data. A total of 207 natural lines of T. arvense were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. The results showed that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats showed higher aphid DNA load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes and novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. The study also found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, including differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. These findings provide insights into the defense mechanisms of T. arvense and demonstrate that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads can be used to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. This approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research, particularly with the increasing availability of large sequencing datasets worldwide. The study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T. arvense and highlights the potential of non-target reads as a valuable source of information for quantifying herbivore and pathogen abundance in large collections.
The emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites poses a significant challenge to malaria control and eradication efforts. To combat this issue, researchers have proposed the use of drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to a partner drug. This study investigated the collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) enzyme. The researchers profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors, focusing on the compound TCMDC-125334. This compound was found to be active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. However, the most common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, and one mutation, DHODH I263S, conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. The selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus, resulting in double mutant parasites that exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Furthermore, the researchers tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation that were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme. The study suggests that combining two DHODH inhibitors based on their collateral sensitivity profiles may not be sufficient to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro.
The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary significantly across different biogeographic regions. While most malaria infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Current models of resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to neglecting the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, a novel compartmental model was developed to track sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. This trend is supported by validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data. Furthermore, post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. The study highlights the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. Strain diversity and associated strain-specific host immunity, dynamically tracked through the macroparasitic structure, can predict the complex relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance frequencies. The model implies that control protocols should vary from region to region and that there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria control worldwide. The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation for why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine, despite lower transmission intensity than Africa. In regions with low strain diversity, parasites cannot repeatedly reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections frequently. The study presents a theoretical argument, built on a mechanistic model, as to why different biogeographic regions show variation in the invasion and maintenance of antimalarial drug resistance.
The study investigated the impact of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoid in cannabis, on early embryonic development using a stepwise in vitro differentiation system. Δ9-THC was found to increase the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not of their primed counterparts. This effect was dependent on the CB1 receptor binding and was associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC increased the glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities of ESCs, a phenomenon known as metabolic bivalence. This metabolic rewiring was retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells (PGCLCs) in the absence of direct exposure and was associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. The study revealed a moderate but significant impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic processes, highlighting the importance of metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages. The results provide the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. The study used a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating in the differentiation of PGCLCs, which unfold during the first trimester in humans. Δ9-THC exposure was tested in three distinct developmental windows: exposure of ESCs, exposure of EpiLCs, and combined ESCs + EpiLCs exposure. Cells were exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0.1 nM-100µM, corresponding to physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users. The study demonstrated that the extensive metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic reprogramming that PGCs undergo during their development is uniquely sensitive to environmental insults, with potential consequences in the offspring.
The study investigated the copy number variation of NLR immune genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a species with hundreds of NLR genes. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, the researchers identified a total of 1513 NLRs, significantly more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of the NLRs were present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of individual fish. In contrast, laboratory strains had up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population as wild fish. Notably, despite the high copy number variation, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes was found to be very low, with around half of the copies being monomorphic and the remaining ones having very few polymorphisms. This suggests a signature of purifying selection, indicating that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. The study also found that the copy numbers of NLRs and their variation were heavily reduced in laboratory strains compared to wild populations, likely due to a recent population bottleneck that marked the establishment of laboratory strains. The results provide a foundation for future studies investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large vertebrate gene families.
The discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov., a new taxon of Famennian ovules from Xinhang, Anhui, China, provides significant insights into the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms in ancient plants. The ovules of Alasemenia are characterized by three integumentary wings that extend outwards and fold inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing most of the nucellus. Unlike other Famennian ovules, Alasemenia lacks a cupule and is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches. This unique morphology suggests that the integuments of early ovules without a cupule may have evolved functions beyond protection and pollination, including photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. The presence of Alasemenia indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plumes and pappi, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with fewer wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions. The discovery of Alasemenia also highlights the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings. Compared to Famennian four-winged ovules of Warsteinia and Guazia, Alasemenia with three distally outwards extending wings shows an advantage in anemochory. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms in ancient plants and provide new insights into the development of winged seeds. The discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. expands our knowledge of the Famennian ovules and highlights the importance of further research into the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms in ancient plants.
The study investigated the role of RAPSYN in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a fatal hematological malignancy. RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Neddylated BCR-ABL enhances its stability by competing with c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, depletion of RAPSYN expression or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and inhibited tumor formation and growth. The study found that RAPSYN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia and promotes disease progression by stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein via neddylation. The neddylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN competes its ubiquitination-dependent degradation to increase the stability of BCR-ABL. RAPSYN inhibition significantly suppressed the survival of Ph+ leukemia, and this phenotype was linked to the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN, which mediated BCR-ABL neddylation to enhance its stability for promoting leukemogenesis. The study also found that BCR-ABL expression levels were correlated with those of RAPSYN, demonstrating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL. The results indicate that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. The study suggests that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation may provide an alternative to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.
The discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hindered by the limited availability of phage genomes. To address this challenge, a new strategy has been developed to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. This approach involves using a lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases in bacterial proteomes.

As a proof-of-concept, five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using the PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens, even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour, while the other three were thermosensitive. The crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were solved, revealing that PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, whereas PHAb8 formed a monomer. Furthermore, two mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10.

This antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs. The approach is based on the observation that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria often contain antimicrobial peptide-like regions. By using a lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases in bacterial proteomes, it is possible to identify new enzymes with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties. The successful identification of PHAb10 and PHAb11 using this approach highlights the potential of this strategy for discovering new antimicrobial agents.
The study aimed to improve the detection of pancreatic cancer by analyzing symptom and disease codes from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records (EHRs). A total of 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018 were included, with 23,592 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement the registry diagnosis codes, a text mining approach was used to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in EHRs for 3,078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30,780 controls. The study generated and compared symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. The results showed that text mining of clinical notes was able to capture more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis than the registry-based analysis. For example, symptoms such as ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found in the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival (<90 days) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which can leverage the full potential of health data and provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer. The study also showed that deep phenotypical information stored in registry data and free text EHRs can be useful for detecting temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, the study reveals a notable increase in the prevalence of early symptoms within EHRs, suggesting the possibility of harnessing the complete potential of health data by incorporating multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes. Future applications could leverage this knowledge and use AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in the clinics. This could ultimately serve as a guide for better screening procedures and improve the lives of pancreatic cancer patients.
The study aimed to investigate the development of the synchronization between slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) and fast sleep spindles (12.5-16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in children, adolescents, and young adults. The researchers used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in four age groups: 5-6 years, 8-11 years, 14-18 years, and 20-26 years. The study found that while the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range (12.5-16 Hz) in all four age groups. However, the coupling pattern was less precise in children. The study also found that fast spindle maturity, which indicates the similarity between development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. The results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles enables precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. The study also found that the maturation of dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles towards adult-like fast spindles may explain age-related differences in the strength and temporal precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Additionally, the study found that fast centro-parietal spindles become more numerous and adult-like in their frequency and amplitude characteristics in the course of maturation, and that the individual neural rhythms that define the coupling undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development.
The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, has led to a significant increase in the number of publications on human genes. However, despite the adoption of high-throughput technologies that have identified novel genes associated with biological processes and disease, the majority of genes featured in present-day publications are those that were already well-studied prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project. An analysis of the selection of genes as research targets suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Furthermore, understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. In contrast, publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect the choice of genes being studied, 33 are significantly associated with the selection of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To address this issue, a tool called find my understudied genes ( FMUG ) has been developed to promote the investigation of understudied genes. FMUG allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits and has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. The tool is available for download as a MacOS/Windows app. The findings suggest that understudied genes are abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. This abandonment may be driven by the concern that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. A literature review identified 45 biological and experimental factors that have been proposed to limit studies of understudied genes, including evolutionary and chemical factors. These factors are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. The development of FMUG aims to promote the investigation of understudied genes by providing a tool for scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits.
Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides have been proposed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain poorly understood. To investigate this, a zebrafish model was established to study the effects of high glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development. The results showed that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induced excessive formation of blood vessels, particularly intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ), in the zebrafish embryos. This excessive angiogenesis was characterized by the ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis revealed an increased ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes in the ECs exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, the study found that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides by upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. The findings suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides can lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. The study provides new evidence of the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and sheds light on the underlying mechanisms. The results also suggest that the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of monosaccharides on blood vessel development. The study's findings have implications for understanding the potential health risks associated with the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides.
The study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the storage of multiple sequences in working memory (WM). Participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. The researchers manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories, finding that sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrated improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Notably, neural reactivation of common trajectories was observed during both encoding and retention periods, and spontaneous replay of color sequences was observed when recalling location sequences. These findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization in WM.

EEG recordings provided neural evidence for the employed 'compressive' strategy, including reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of color sequences during location recall. Structure reactivation was related to WM behavior and neural replay, indicating that shared common structures enable the storage of multiple sequences in WM through compressed encoding and neural replay.

Behavioral results showed that sequences with consistent color-location trajectories (aligned condition) exhibited enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. Furthermore, when subjects prepared to recall location sequences, the currently task-irrelevant color sequence demonstrated a spontaneous sequential replay profile, highlighting the close bond between color and location sequences when they share a common trajectory.

The study provides converging behavioral and neural evidence for the spontaneous leveraging of common structures to facilitate WM. Neural replay has been posited to represent abstract structure, structure-based inference, and generalization in previous studies. In this study, when subjects prepared to recall location sequences, neural replay occurred for color sequences but not for location sequences, supporting the spontaneous nature of neural replay, as color features were not task-relevant at that time. Overall, the findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences in WM through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization in WM.
The human PURA gene is responsible for encoding a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Mutations in the PURA gene have been linked to the neurodevelopmental disorder PURA syndrome, characterized by full disease penetrance in almost all reported cases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic variations causing PURA syndrome on the functional and structural integrity of the human PURA (hsPURA) protein. The researchers observed that patient mutations across the PURA gene impair its co-localization with processing bodies and result in the destruction of its folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The study also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The results indicate that the PURA protein exhibits unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity, making it particularly susceptible to mutations that impair its structural integrity. This finding provides an explanation for why even conservative mutations across the PURA gene result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. The study also found that pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are distributed along the entire protein sequence, in contrast to other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, where hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations have been identified. The researchers experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA and the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. The study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of hsPURA were previously predicted to have folding defects. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PURA syndrome and may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for this disorder.
The interaction between transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and anoctamin 1 (ANO1) plays a crucial role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting its involvement in perspiration. In mouse foot pads, TRPV4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in secretory cells of sweat glands. TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were observed in mouse sweat glands, which were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol in both wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. Furthermore, basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. These findings suggest that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1. The results also indicate that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components, as well as the secretion of water and ions. The interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO1 complex could be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration. TRPV4 expression in human eccrine sweat glands and its functional interaction with ANO1 suggest that it plays a role in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction force. TRPV4-deficient mice showed reduced ability to climb a slippery slope compared to wild-type mice, supporting the idea that sweating is important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads.
The study presents a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices, demonstrating that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. The cortices of 11 primate species and over 70 other mammalian species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, indicating that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. This new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale, allowing for the identification of scale-dependent effects of biological processes such as ageing. The study proposes a novel syntax for expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale, providing a more detailed and informative description than traditional summary morphometric measures or the listing of every sulcus and gyrus. This approach reveals a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding. The study also demonstrates that the new method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes more effectively than traditional metrics, with a fourfold increase in effect size at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm. The findings have important implications for the development of biomarkers for a range of conditions and may lead to a more precise understanding of brain morphology and its changes over time.
This study investigated the dynamics of the RELA transcription factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells using live single-cell imaging and RNA sequencing. RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in PDAC tumours. The study found that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA in PDAC cells. Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets revealed that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. The study also characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. The results provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC. Additionally, the study identified that the known actin modulators ARHGAP31/NUAK2 are both RELA targets and regulators of nuclear RELA with TNFα, providing a potential mechanism mediating the relationship between actin and RELA. The study also found that RELA forms NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1, and NFKB2 in PDAC cells, and that IκBβ plays a significant role in suppressing TNFα induction of nuclear RELA in PDAC cells. The results suggest that RELA is highly modulated by NF-κB/IκB proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues.
The balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) in the brain is crucial for proper function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which regulates this equilibrium, are associated with various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are linked to ASDs. However, the impact of PTEN deficiencies on inhibitory and excitatory signaling is unclear. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, researchers investigated the effects of daf-18/PTEN mutations on GABAergic and cholinergic signaling. The study found that daf-18/PTEN mutations selectively impaired GABAergic neurodevelopment and function, resulting in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. This defect was attributed to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO, a transcription factor, during development. In contrast, cholinergic excitatory motor neurons remained unaffected. The researchers also discovered that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induced DAF-16/FOXO activity, thereby improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. These findings provide insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets. The study suggests that β-hydroxybutyrate may act early in development to mitigate GABAergic defects in daf-18/PTEN mutants. The results demonstrate that mutations in daf-18/PTEN lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without affecting cholinergic excitatory signals. The study highlights the importance of DAF-16/FOXO activity in GABAergic development and suggests that its downregulation contributes to the hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway in GABAergic neurons of daf-18/PTEN mutants. The conservation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment.
This study investigated the role of innate immune responses in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The researchers found that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes can inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, they identified interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as a key mediator of inflammation that potently inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. IL-1β activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at cell-cell junctions, thereby preventing syncytia formation. In vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. The study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection and provides potential therapeutic targets for viral control. The findings demonstrate that IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation by activating the RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at the cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Furthermore, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo. The study reveals a critical function for proinflammatory cytokines in controlling viral infection and highlights the importance of IL-1β in restricting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. The results suggest that IL-1β may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19.
In vivo electrophysiological recordings of Drosophila insulin-producing cells (IPCs) revealed that their activity is strongly modulated by nutritional state. IPCs are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. The study found that IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation and rebounded after refeeding with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars. In contrast, non-nutritive sugars had no effect on IPC activity. Glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. In contrast, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44PINs) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. This suggests that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. The study demonstrates that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. The findings highlight the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. The study advances our understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila and provides new insights into the regulation of glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior.
The development of endogenous tags has revolutionized the field of cell biology by enabling the visualization and study of native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is a challenging task due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. To overcome this limitation, researchers have engineered a split mNeonGreen protein that can be used for large-scale endogenous tagging in human cells. In this study, the split mNeonGreen system was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ). The system consists of two fragments of the mNeonGreen protein, mNG21-10 and mNG211, which can be expressed separately and then reconstitute to form a functional fluorescent protein. The researchers engineered an iPSC line to constitutively express the mNG21-10 fragment and demonstrated that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the mNG211 fragment. This approach allows for the study of protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. Furthermore, the researchers used a neural network-based image restoration technique to enable live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and provides a foundation for studying protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro. The split mNeonGreen system offers a high-throughput approach for generating a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells and has the potential to revolutionize the field of cell biology.
The article presents a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. The performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. The technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. The method was demonstrated to work with a linear multicontact probe by testing with a U-Probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex. There are no particular limitations that would prevent the specific electrolytic lesioning technique and device from working with any passive multielectrode probe. The electrolytic lesioning method presented here enables small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. Selection of the electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes’ shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity.
Bees are crucial pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are threatened by the use of pesticides. One of the primary risks bees face is the poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides, particularly neonicotinoids. Research on bee detection of neonicotinoids has yielded conflicting evidence regarding whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and thus avoid them. To investigate this, an assay for detecting food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology was used to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) can detect the presence of neonicotinoids in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). The study found that bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These findings provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, it is predicted that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. However, only a few studies have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar, and the conclusions of these studies are contradictory. This study used a combination of sensitive behavioral assays and electrophysiology to test in detail whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. The results suggest that bumblebees cannot taste neonicotinoids in nectar or on their own in water. This conclusion has been challenged by a previous study in free-flying B. terrestris foragers. Neonicotinoids have been shown to impair foraging behavior, homing and orientation behavior, and olfactory learning and memory in bees. Most studies have administered pesticides in sugar solutions, where bees consume the solution and then a change in behavior or performance is recorded.
Biomedical researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 6322 non-human primates (NHPs) from 148 sites across Southeast Asia to investigate the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite of public health concern. The study aimed to quantify the prevalence of P. knowlesi in NHPs and identify geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. The analysis revealed that P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. The study found that regions with higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots, suggesting a link between P. knowlesi transmission in wildlife and humans.

The researchers used remote sensing data and statistical models to identify relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. The results indicate that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which could explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. This study addresses critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and suggests that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.

Previous studies have shown associations between landscape and variation in the prevalence of simian Plasmodium spp. in primates, but this study is the first to systematically assess P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs at a regional scale and across a wide range of habitats. The results highlight the marked spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates in NHPs. The study emphasizes the importance of considering infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs in future public health interventions, given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology.
The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To investigate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae was constructed by integrating molecular data with information from the fossil record. The results indicate that the crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. The two extant subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively, with Pinopsida being the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae. The most recent radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins. Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. The two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana, and both have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. The divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus in the East Gondwana clade was estimated at 44.7 million years ago, during the Paleocene-Eocene separation of South America and Australia.
The study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution in hepatocellular carcinomas using high-resolution genetic data from resected tumours with multiple samples taken in two and three dimensions. By analyzing the spatial distribution of mutations, the researchers aim to understand how tumour cells grow and evolve within the tumour volume. The study leverages previously published data from late-stage tumours to infer how the tumours grew in earlier stages. To achieve this, the researchers develop metrics of intra-tumour heterogeneity that take into account the spatial position of all samples. The results show that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume, rather than at the surface. The study also examines how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to overall tumour growth. The findings provide new insights into the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. The study builds on previous research that has linked spatial tumour sampling with evolution, including phylogenetic comparison of samples from primary and metastatic tumours. However, the current study focuses on the intra-tumour dynamics, using high-resolution data to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution. The results suggest that the growth rate is uniform across the tumour, and the interplay between tissue dynamics and genetic evolution is complex. The study's findings have implications for understanding the early stages of tumour development and can inform the development of new therapeutic strategies.
This study investigated the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism in Cacopsylla chinensis, a species that exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism in the form of summer-form and winter-form with distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remained largely unknown. The study identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature and CcTRPM. The two subunits formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Additionally, the study found that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. The findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor. The study suggests that Bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development. The results indicate that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects, and further studies are needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. A driver mutation in DMGs is the lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M), which reshapes the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors. The study proposes a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG tumors. HDAC inhibition, in combination with the novel MYC inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduced tumor growth in vivo. The findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 (methylation and acetylation) and lysine 4 (methylation) on histone H3. High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas, and H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling. The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and to block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma. To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, researchers tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcome.
The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, P. leucopus exhibits no apparent disability or diminished fitness. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, researchers compared the genome-wide transcriptional responses of P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin used to elicit inflammation. The results showed that P. leucopus had a distinct LPS response profile compared to mice and rats, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast to mice and rats, P. leucopus displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. Furthermore, P. leucopus had reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors compared to mice. These findings suggest that P. leucopus has a unique mechanism for infection tolerance, which may also be present in other animal reservoirs for human diseases. The study highlights the differences in inflammatory responses between P. leucopus and mice, with P. leucopus exhibiting an "alternatively activated" or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype, whereas mice showed a "classically activated" or M1-type polarization phenotype. The results also indicate that P. leucopus has a restrained transcriptional response to LPS, with lower fold-changes in certain genes compared to mice. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of infection tolerance in P. leucopus and has implications for understanding the biology of zoonotic diseases.
Caspases are a family of proteases that play a crucial role in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. In humans, caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E (GSDME). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7, and the underlying mechanism of this observation was unclear. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME revealed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. The p10 subunit contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate CASP7, except in mammals. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals. Furthermore, the study identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. Mutation of the cleavage site inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage. These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates.
Ketamine has emerged as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but inter-individual variability in response to ketamine remains poorly understood. A single-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants. Participants received an initial bolus of 0.23 mg/kg ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 0.58 mg/kg/hr. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified using data-driven global brain connectivity, and the results were related to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets.

The study found that both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine were multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability. The data-driven principal neural gradient effect of ketamine matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not. Furthermore, behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine and have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

Previous studies have shown that ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity (GBC) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy controls and normalize reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hours post-ketamine. The current study hypothesized that ketamine would result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to ketamine. The study also investigated the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by comparing it to two other psychoactive substances, psilocybin and LSD, which have shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression but have different pharmacological profiles.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers during the early evolution of life. However, the autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem due to the reduction in replication speed caused by product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands. This results in parabolic kinetics of growth, where the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence maintains diversity. To test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth, the authors investigated stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. The results show that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species, while alleviating the error threshold problem relative to exponential amplification. Additionally, sequence properties and the strength of resource competition determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. The study demonstrates that stochastic parabolic growth could have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes. The authors used a constant population model to investigate the diversity-maintaining mechanisms in parabolic regimes and found that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication. Furthermore, a chemostat model of parabolic replication was used to demonstrate that increased competition can induce a switch from coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest. The diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators. Parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit, and is inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, which can efficiently damp competition and promote coexistence.
The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5), has been found to cleave human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme responsible for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. This cleavage results in the inactivation of TRMT1, leading to a decrease in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications in human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. The cleavage site in TRMT1 matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The cleavage fragments of TRMT1 exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Furthermore, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA compared to wild-type human cells. These findings suggest that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2,2G-modified tRNAs, and that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. The results provide evidence that TRMT1 is a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand the evolution of disease-causing microbes, particularly those that are not obligate pathogens but can take advantage of ecological opportunities to become pathogenic. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. To experimentally test this idea, researchers evolved replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast species, to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. The goal was to determine whether selection for plastic adherence would lead to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence.

The results showed that, along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes—biofilm formation and flor formation—increased in the evolved yeast populations. Another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to nutrient limitation. These findings suggest that experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. When wax moth larvae were injected with these evolved hyper-multicellular strains, they were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. This indicates that selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence.

The study supports the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens. The results demonstrate that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits, a common feature of organismal evolution. In this case, favoring the ability to adhere to plastic, a surface common in industrial, medical, and domestic settings, led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of disease-causing microbes and the potential for opportunistic pathogens to emerge in various environments.
The study investigated the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains (PLDs) using a residue-resolution coarse-grained model called Mpipi. The researchers simulated 140 PLD mutants from six proteins (hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1) to quantify the effects of mutations on the stability of PLD condensates. The results revealed the existence of scaling laws that describe the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These scaling laws were found to be consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and were applicable across the entire family of PLDs tested. The study demonstrated that the effects of successive mutations can be predicted by the addition of the appropriate laws, as long as the resulting mutation adheres to PLD composition and patterning biases. The researchers employed a systematic approach to vary the amino acid sequence of the PLDs, analyzing three types of scaling laws for each type of mutation. The results showed that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs can be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs investigated. The study provides a quantitative framework for understanding how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions varies in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. The findings suggest that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates, offering a new approach to describe the phase behavior of a large set of protein variants. The study's results are consistent with experimental evidence and computational predictions, highlighting the importance of interactions involving aromatic residues in stabilizing condensates formed by PLDs. The data are presented in Table 1, which illustrates the effect of single-point mutations on the critical solution temperatures of the family of PLDs as a function of PLD length.
Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. Traditional approaches rely on structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. However, these methods neglect the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. To address this limitation, a new approach has been proposed that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and combines it with the Fisher kernel. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, preserving the structure of the underlying model. This approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine. The HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is particularly important for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training and test sets. The approach was tested on an example fMRI dataset and simulated data, demonstrating its potential to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits. The HMM-Fisher kernel was compared to other prediction methods, including kernels that ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model and a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. The results show that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach outperforms these methods, providing a reliable and accurate way to predict individual traits from brain activity patterns. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine by providing a more comprehensive understanding of brain function and behavior.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease are associated with variants of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, which leads to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating LRRK2 activity have remained poorly defined. A targeted siRNA screen identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, researchers isolated lysosomes and demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. Furthermore, PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, resulted in increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates at the lysosome. Enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates. The study also examined the effects of two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, and found that they increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes. Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The study identifies Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity and demonstrates that it plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. Pathogenic PD variants, including VPS35 D620N and LRRK2 R1441G, result in increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes, suggesting a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease.
The study presents a novel method for analyzing the cell cycle at the single-cell level in both adherent and non-adherent cells using the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor. This approach combines a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm to enable precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. The method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which exhibit unique cell cycle characteristics, and was used to test the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. The cell cycle analysis system is fully automated and compatible with adherent cells, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. The study also presents a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology in a fully automated manner. The experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5, and the original time-lapse images were composed of red and green channels detecting the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator. The method allows researchers to analyze thousands of ( non- ) adherent cells per experimental condition by using image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing, cell tracking, filtering of incorrect tracks, and cell cycle phases identification and characterization. The image and data analysis workflows rely on Fiji and R software, which are widely used by the imaging and data analysis community, and the scripts are publicly available for customization. This approach provides a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.
The study investigated the relationship between cognitive skills and socio-ecological constraints in 16 primate species using an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Brain imaging data were used to measure the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), which are involved in metacognition and working memory, respectively. The results showed that the size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). This suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Notably, FP volume was more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, which is consistent with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. The study highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates. The findings support the ecological brain hypothesis, which proposes that brain size and cognitive abilities are shaped by ecological pressures. The study also provides a critical insight into the specific neuro-cognitive operations associated with foraging strategies in primates, suggesting that working memory and planning skills are critical for foraging in primates, especially when they need to travel long distances. The results of this study complement laboratory studies and bridge the gap between cognitive neurosciences, behavioral ecology, and primate evolution. Further research is needed to capture the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild, as well as their interactions.
The study aimed to investigate whether the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to mechanical loading is mediated by an increase in the size of myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy) or the number of myofibrils (myofibrillogenesis). To address this question, the researchers developed a novel method called fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID), which allows for high-resolution imaging of myofibrils using a standard fluorescence microscope. This method enabled the development of pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. The researchers validated the accuracy of the FIM-ID measurements by comparing them to manual measurements obtained using electron microscopy (EM). The results showed that the automated measurements were indistinguishable from the manual measurements, indicating that FIM-ID is a reliable method for assessing myofibril size and number.

The researchers then used FIM-ID to investigate the effect of mechanical loading on muscle fibers in both mouse and human models. They found that the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to increased mechanical loading was largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis, or the increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than myofibril hypertrophy, or the increase in the size of individual myofibrils. This suggests that the growth of muscle fibers in response to mechanical loading is primarily due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than an increase in the size of individual myofibrils.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of muscle growth and development, which is a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle biology. The FIM-ID method developed in this study offers a time- and cost-effective means of studying muscle growth and development, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. The results of this study have implications for our understanding of muscle growth and development, and highlight the importance of myofibrillogenesis in this process.
The study investigated the effects of three missense mutations in the SNAP25 protein on synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons. SNAP25 is a key component of the SNARE complex, which mediates the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The mutations, V48F, D166Y, and I67N, were found to disrupt the interaction between SNAP25 and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating vesicle priming and release. The results showed that all three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons.

The V48F and D166Y mutations were found to have a gain-of-function effect, increasing the release probability and lowering the energy barrier for fusion. This was associated with an increase in spontaneous release and a decrease in the readily releasable pool (RRP) size. In contrast, the I67N mutation had a loss-of-function effect, increasing the energy barrier for fusion and reducing the frequency of spontaneous release. The RRP size was unaffected in this case.

The study also found that the V48F and D166Y mutations increased the association of SNAP25 with partner SNAREs, leading to unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutation decreased the association of SNAP25 with Syt1, leading to a decrease in vesicle priming. The results suggest that pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 can cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion.

The study highlights the importance of the Syt1-SNAP25 interaction in regulating vesicle priming and release. The findings also suggest that the role of Syt1 in vesicle priming may be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle exocytosis and the development of mechanism-based treatments for disorders caused by SNAP25 mutations.
The study analyzed data from 30 countries to investigate the relationship between the proportion of women in a research discipline and the evaluation of research quality and funding success rates. Contrary to previous findings that women’s work is valued less, regardless of who performs it, the study found a correlation between a higher proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality evaluations and funding success rates. This effect was observed for both men and women, and was robust to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures. The study used independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and looked separately at research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores.

The results showed that researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines received lower evaluations compared to those in male-dominated disciplines. Funding success rates also displayed a similar correlation, with researchers in male-dominated disciplines having higher success rates than those in female-dominated disciplines. The study controlled for researcher characteristics such as age, research institution, and publishing patterns, but the findings remained consistent.

The study did not suggest that research done in female-dominated disciplines is of lower quality, but rather that it is consistently evaluated as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This has a detrimental effect on everyone in those disciplines, but will disproportionately affect more women than men. The study speculates that the finding may be related to the feminization of a discipline over time, but notes that this cannot be explored with the available data.

The study builds on previous research that has found that women’s work is valued less, regardless of who performs it. The findings have implications for the evaluation and funding of research, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between gender and research quality. The study’s results suggest that the evaluation of research quality is influenced by the gender balance of the discipline, rather than the quality of the research itself.
In the field of synthetic biology, researchers have been working towards designing molecular circuits that can process information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a crucial component of these circuits, enabling the modulation of gene expression or the recording of information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, a new strategy called ‘P3 editing’ has been developed, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, researchers have demonstrated that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. This approach enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. Furthermore, P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits. The strategy has been shown to be efficient and specific, with the ability to control genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged protein domains. The crRNA-MS2/BoxB-petracrRNA design has been engineered to improve the efficiency and specificity of P3 editing, mimicking the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system. Overall, P3 editing represents a significant advancement in the field of synthetic biology, enabling the design of complex molecular circuits that can process information in a predictable manner within living cells.
The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex plays a crucial role in mediating the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs) in cardiomyocytes, which is essential for the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs channels are associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to activate IKs channels by binding to two distinct sites, one in the voltage sensor domain and the other in the pore domain, thereby increasing the maximal conductance of the channels. However, the mechanism by which PUFAs enhance the maximal conductance of IKs channels is not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 channels is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability of the channels, and that PUFAs increase the maximal conductance by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.

The KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex is a voltage-gated K+ channel expressed in the heart, where it associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit to generate the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs). Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with LQTS, leading to a reduction of the channel current and a significant prolongation of the ventricular action potential waveform, resulting in a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram. PUFAs have been shown to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week. PUFAs increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, described as the "Lipoelectric mechanism," which involves shifting the voltage dependence of activation and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels.

Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex. The mechanism of PUFAs to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance relies on the ability of PUFAs to favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter, promoting interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that stabilize the channel pore. This stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state is thought to be the primary mechanism by which PUFAs increase the maximal conductance of IKs channels.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in various human brain disorders, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. The enzyme pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP) controls the levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, and may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept have been lacking. This study identifies a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus, providing a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, the researchers discovered 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Notably, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain. The study suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The identification of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.
The development of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) involves the coordinated production and migration of diverse cell types, including distal tip cells (DTCs), which arise from the asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) Z1 and Z4. The mirror-symmetric structure of the gonad is guided by the migration of DTCs, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. This study investigates the role of Wnt signaling in establishing the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which is essential for the proper migration of DTCs.

The results show that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins: CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. Notably, in lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side.

Further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 (RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

The study also shows that the distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 are crucial for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. CWN-1 induces HL polarity for both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-2 induces the opposite polarity; LH for Z1 and HL for Z4. EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of the C. elegans gonad and highlight the importance of Wnt signaling in establishing the mirror-symmetric structure of the gonad.
Biomedical researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that exploit tradeoffs to combat drug resistance. Tradeoffs occur when resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable remains unclear, particularly whether mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this question, the authors conducted evolution experiments using yeast cells to capture a broader spectrum of mutations that provide a fitness advantage in the presence of fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. The researchers used lineage-tracking to quantify fitness tradeoffs for 774 evolved mutants across 12 different environments. The results showed that these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs, suggesting that each group affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. The authors found that some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do, and some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings highlight the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. However, the study also demonstrates that by grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, it is possible to reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from over 774 to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. This approach may empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. The study's findings also guide efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms. The results suggest that a high-throughput evolutionary approach can be used to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their associated tradeoffs, providing valuable insights for the development of effective multidrug therapies.
The central tendency bias, also known as contraction bias, is a phenomenon in which the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy employed by the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, recency biases, such as serial dependence, are also commonly observed and are believed to reflect the content of working memory. Recent studies have suggested that both biases may be more closely related than previously thought. A study using an auditory delayed comparison task in rats found that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. This suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating contraction bias. A proposed model of the circuit involved in generating the behavior shows that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting towards past sensory experience, producing short-term sensory history biases, naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors occurring at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the sensory distribution’s mean. The results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. The model was further validated by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task. The study highlights the importance of the PPC in modulating contraction bias and provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and sensory perception. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and stores sensory information, and how this information is used to make judgments and decisions.
The study aimed to investigate the role of PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) in lung cancer and its potential as a target for therapy. PDLIM2 was previously identified as a tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This study used human clinical samples and a mouse model of lung cancer to examine PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. The results showed that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. To restore PDLIM2 expression, a nano-delivery system was used to systemically administer PDLIM2-expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) to mice with lung cancer. The study found that nanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, and antitumor activity, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. The combination of nanoPDLIM2 with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, making the tumors sensitive to ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs. The study established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers. The findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.
Scientists have long sought to understand how animals assess the quality of their food and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. To address this question, researchers established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers a cellular response known as the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) and an immune response in animals. This response encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The study revealed that the physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors. Furthermore, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study demonstrates the role of the cellular stress response pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.

    The researchers used a previously established low-quality food evaluation assay system to elucidate the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the UPRER - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis. The study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors. This slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by the quick sensory nervous system.

    The study also investigated which nutrients/metabolites are sensed by animals through the XBP-1-PMK-1 axis for food quality evaluation. The results suggest that animals may assess the quality of food through the UPRER and innate immune pathway. To determine whether the UPRER and innate immune pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, the researchers examined whether the activation of the UPRER by HK-E. coli was dependent on the known signaling components of the UPRER branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4 and ATF-6.
The study investigated the role of carbohydrates in modulating drug targets, specifically G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). The researchers focused on P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a receptor involved in inflammation and immune responses, and its activation by sugar nucleotides. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional studies, the team identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14 and revealed that UDP-glucose can activate the receptor by bridging transmembrane helices 2 and 7. A conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 [KDKE] ) was found to distinguish between different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This conserved motif was also identified in P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and three sugar nucleotides were designed as agonists of P2Y12 based on this motif. The study expands our understanding of the activation of purinergic receptors and provides insights for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs targeting GPCRs. The findings suggest that carbohydrates can directly modulate GPCRs, and the conserved sugar-binding motif identified in P2Y14 and P2Y12 may serve as a target for the development of new therapeutic agents. The study also highlights the importance of carbohydrates in regulating GPCRs and suggests that further investigations into carbohydrate regulation of GPCRs may lead to new concepts and physiological understanding in the field.
The study investigated the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of Drosophila neural stem cells (Neuroblasts, NBs) during brain development. It was found that glial cells produce ferritin, which cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production. This process is essential for the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin-encoding genes led to energy shortages in NBs, resulting in low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs. The study also demonstrated that ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression and that the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism.

The results showed that only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development, suggesting that ferritin generated in glial cells is crucial for regulating the behavior of NBs. In a proliferative state, NBs receive iron from glial cells via ferritin to fulfill their energy requirements for proliferation and self-renewal. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells.

Furthermore, glial cells can clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring normal NB function during neural development. The study also explored whether bicellular iron homeostasis exists in other stem cells and their niches. When normal NBs are converted into immortal tumor NBs, becoming highly proliferative, they need more nutrients, including iron. However, it remains unclear whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal, and differentiation.

Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms, participating in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that support ATP production used for most cellular activities. The study found that the size of tumors was strikingly decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferritin, suggesting that glial ferritin is required for tumor development and highlighting a potential target for tumor treatment. To verify whether iron is involved in the tumor suppression induced by blocking glial ferritin, the study tried to decrease iron levels by adding the iron chelator BPS in the Drosophila food.
The relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 has been a topic of interest during the pandemic, with some countries reporting that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels. This study aimed to further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US by comparing pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. The study found that nationally in 2020, multiple cause cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to approximately 13, 600 excess deaths. The mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7% ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic, 0–1% ). In contrast, there was a substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37% ) and Alzheimer’s ( 19% ). To understand these differences, the study simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. The results showed that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. The study suggests that the lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer itself rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple cause-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen.
The Smc5/6 complex, a core regulator of chromosome architecture, plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription in eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are common transcriptional by-products consisting of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes are not fully understood. This study demonstrates that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. The Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. The Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions, including active gene transcription and telomere length regulation. The complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also be formed at telomeres and near DNA replication forks. The Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels in the cellular response to R-loop formation: within and between pathways. It contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA, and its role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes. The study reveals a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The results suggest that the severe growth defects of yeast defective in both RNase H and the Smc5/6 complex can be linked to an accumulation of R-loops in the chromosomes of these cells.
Title: Preserved Communication Abilities Promote Healthy Ageing: A Longitudinal Study of Neural Filtering and Listening Behaviour in Ageing Individuals

A longitudinal study of 105 ageing individuals (39-82 years) investigated the relationship between neural filtering and listening behaviour over a 2-year period. The study aimed to determine whether preserved attentional neural filtering could compensate for age-typical loss of sensory acuity and predict individual change in listening behaviour. The results showed that listening-task performance remained stable over the 2-year period, despite a decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity. However, neural filtering and listening behaviour were found to follow largely independent developmental trajectories.

The study used electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioural data to examine the relationship between neural filtering and listening behaviour at two timepoints (T1 and T2). The results showed that neural filtering and listening behaviour were correlated within each separate measurement timepoint, but not longitudinally. Furthermore, the study found that neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies.

The study replicated the previously observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationship, where an individual's neural filtering ability was found to impact their listening performance independently of age or hearing status. However, when analysed in the longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, the study did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain-behaviour links observed within each timepoint.

The study characterised the changes in hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance across the middle to older adult lifespan. The results showed that hearing acuity declined with age, while neural filtering and listening performance remained relatively stable. The study also found that the relationship between neural filtering and listening behaviour was not longitudinally stable, suggesting that neural filtering may not be a reliable predictor of individual change in listening behaviour over time.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between neural filtering and listening behaviour in ageing individuals. The results suggest that while neural filtering may play a role in listening behaviour at a given timepoint, it may not be a reliable predictor of individual change in listening behaviour over time. This has important implications for the development of interventions aimed at promoting healthy ageing and preserving communication abilities in older adults.
The study investigated the relationship between chemosensation, the perception of taste and flavour, and the therapeutic use of botanical drugs in ancient Graeco-Roman times. The researchers generated tasting-panel data for a range of botanical drugs and applied phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavours, could predict their therapeutic use. The results showed that chemosensation was strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with botanical drugs having high therapeutic versatility exhibiting simple yet intense tastes and flavours. In fact, 21 out of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. The study also found that certain chemosensory qualities, such as starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy, were associated with therapeutic versatility, in addition to the common notion of bitter-tasting medicines. These findings suggest that the uses of drugs in ancient Greece and Rome were based on observed physiological effects that are consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology. The study proposes that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explained the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. Furthermore, the study suggests that taste and flavour perception of botanical drugs links humoral theory, the principal underlying concept of Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, to modern medicine. The study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties, showing that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science, even though aetiologies were fundamentally different in Graeco-Roman times. The results of this study provide an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation, in combination with physiological effects, guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times.
Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri, are known to cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia, leading to sepsis and death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying their ability to enter the bloodstream remain poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers used an injection-based microfluidics device to simulate GI bleeding and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is mediated by chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. The researchers report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues.

The study found that Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Furthermore, Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth, and chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. The researchers define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

The study demonstrates that the mechanism of Tsr-mediated chemoattraction to serum is through direct recognition of L-serine, and that serum, and L-serine present in serum, could be a source of nutrients during infection. The researchers also found that while Tsr is not the only chemoreceptor involved in taxis to serum for S. enterica, it does play an important role through chemoattraction to the high concentration of L-serine within serum. The study suggests that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth advantages.

The researchers undertook structural studies to understand the specific recognition of L-serine by Tsr and found that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid, with the motile population reorganizing within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source. Serum taxis occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli within serum, one of which is the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine.
Biomedical researchers have identified a conserved genetic program that defines the cellular identity of male germ cells across animal species, spanning over 600 million years of evolution. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, the study reveals that approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes are required for the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell, with a third of these genes forming a deeply conserved genetic scaffold. This scaffold contains 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, the researchers uncovered 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies. The study suggests that despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes, the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. The researchers propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact. This conserved male germ cell gene expression program can provide clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility.
In the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, eukaryotic flagellate motility is characterized by coordinated flagellar beating and steering through differential modulation of beating amplitudes. This strategy relies on inherent flagellar asymmetries and their effective coordination in synchronous beating. However, the persistence of flagellar asymmetries in synchrony remains unclear. It has been speculated that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties appear to be copied by the other. To elucidate the roles of each flagellum in synchronous beating, the authors combined experiments, computations, and modeling efforts. They employed a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum and found that the coordinated beating responds only to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This asymmetry in response is attributed to a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. The results highlight distinct roles for each flagellum in coordination and have implications for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. The authors also developed a reduced stochastic model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this asymmetry. The model represents selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating, and Monte-Carlo simulations were used to clarify the interplay between flows and flagella. The findings demonstrate that the cis flagellum plays a leading role in the coordination of flagellar beating, while the trans flagellum responds to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of eukaryotic flagellate motility and has implications for understanding the tactic behaviors of biflagellates.
The study investigated the mechanism underlying the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting (IF) and found that it promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in the intestine. IL-22 plays a crucial role in the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, a process that increases energy expenditure and improves metabolic health. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s into diet-induced-obese mice increased beigeing of white adipose tissue, while exogenous IL-22 administration also induced beigeing. Conversely, deficiency of the IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated the beigeing induced by IF. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that IF increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s, suggesting a potential mechanism by which IF promotes IL-22 production. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that IF may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These findings establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue and suggest that the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of IF. The study provides evidence that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by IF, and that IL-22R mediates the effect of intestinal ILC3s on beigeing of white adipocytes. The results reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue, highlighting the importance of ILC3s in metabolic regulation.
The study aimed to investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms contribute to defensive responses in mice subjected to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. A serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) periods was paired with footshock to elicit a range of defensive behaviors, including freezing, jumping, and darting. The paired SCS-footshock group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period on day 2 of conditioning. In contrast, the unpaired and reversed SCS groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely exhibited jumping or darting during WN.

During extinction sessions, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Notably, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings suggest that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.

The study highlights the importance of considering both associative and non-associative mechanisms in Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. The use of a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors provides a more comprehensive understanding of defensive response dynamics. The results demonstrate that associative factors are necessary for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression, while non-associative factors contribute to some defensive responsiveness. The study's findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying defensive behavior and may inform the development of more effective treatments for anxiety disorders.
Insects rely on their ability to track their orientation to navigate their environment. Previous studies have shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a functional advantage. To address this question, the authors establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and demonstrate that many circuits can perform this task with different activity patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal one is found to be the most noise-resilient when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. The authors compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding a strong agreement. Furthermore, they show that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, suggesting that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but can develop during development. The consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but can be explained by basic evolutionary principles. The authors also predict that the position integrating neurons in these insects have sinusoidal activation patterns and propose that the encoding of direction in insects is fundamentally different from that of mammals, which use many more neurons. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the evolution of head direction circuits in insects and highlights the importance of noise-resilience in the sinusoidal encoding of head direction. The findings are supported by electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies that have shown a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern in the neural population encoding head direction in insects. The study also reviews previous models of heading integration circuits in insects, ranging from simplified conceptual networks to sophisticated models constrained by biological data. The authors argue that the sinusoidal activity encoding is not the only reason for its prevalence in insect navigation, as other circuits with different encoding patterns can also enable easy vector addition.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which play crucial roles in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. This study investigated the role of CISD1 in PD pathophysiology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

The researchers discovered that CISD1 has a heightened propensity to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide bridge, rendering CISD1 unable to coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpression of Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila resulted in reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This effect was more pronounced in Pink1 mutant flies. In contrast, complete loss of Cisd rescued the detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure.

The study suggests that CISD1, particularly its iron-depleted form, operates downstream of Pink1 and partially Parkin loss of function in flies and probably also in humans. This sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and implicates CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target. Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation and the presence of a CISD1 multimer in PINK1 mutant neurons, indicating the presence of apo-CISD1, a form of CISD1 devoid of its iron-sulfur cluster, caused by changes in iron homeostasis. Overexpression of Cisd was found to be neurotoxic, disrupting mitochondrial morphology and leading to the accumulation of phospho-ubiquitin, which may block mitophagy and result in the accumulation of defective mitochondria. The study proposes that CISD1 plays a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation, particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1.
The study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants, but previous research showed that insects were attracted to leaves rather than the flowers. The current study found that exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. The study demonstrated that SAP54 suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) was identified as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed SVP null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. The research highlights the dual role of SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction, integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. SAP54 acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. The study provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions. The findings suggest that SAP54 targets a conserved host regulator, SVP, to attract female leafhopper vectors to produce more progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males. This intricate interaction is detailed in the mechanism proposed in Figure 7. The study expands the mechanistic understanding of insect gender-specific factors targeted by parasites and highlights the sophisticated regulatory effect of SVP and other MADS-box transcription factors targeted by SAP54 on plant responses to the different sexes of the herbivores. The research demonstrates that SAP54 promotes fecundity of the AY-WB phytoplasma leafhopper vector M. quadrilineatus and facilitates phytoplasma transmission by promoting the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors. The study illustrates how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments are often ineffective due to the fungus's ability to develop a strong drug tolerance response, allowing some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better understand this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular and single-cell level, researchers used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. The study aimed to characterize the subpopulation characteristics of C. albicans in response to antifungal compounds.

    The researchers used the fungal DROP-seq system to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells from C. albicans populations that were either untreated or exposed to antifungal compounds, with a focus on fluconazole ( FCZ ). The study found that profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage, with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, surviving cells bifurcated into two major subpopulations : one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state ; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persisted at 3 and 6 days post-treatment.

    The study provides evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival. The findings suggest that the underlying mechanisms and implications of antifungal drug tolerance in C. albicans differ from those of bacterial heteroresistance, in which a small subpopulation exhibits growth in bacteriocidal drugs. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular and single-cell mechanisms of antifungal drug tolerance in C. albicans to develop effective treatments against this opportunistic pathogen.
The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that variation among species in the effectiveness of selection determines the minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirical estimates of effective population size are often based on putatively neutral genetic diversity and are assumed to capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. However, a potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. Previous metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in GC content and/or amino acid composition. To address this limitation, a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS) has been proposed, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, which corrects for both confounders.

The CAIS is an extension of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), using information-theory-based Kullback-Leibler divergence to correct for GC and amino acid composition. This allows for the calculation of CAIS without data on polymorphism or mutation rate, without selecting reference genes, and without concerns about demographic history. The CAIS measures the proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective, positing that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias.

Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation than estimates of effective population size based on neutral polymorphism. Both CAIS and the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) can be estimated for far more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances, but only a single complete genome. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies.

A new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level has been developed, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. Vertebrates were chosen due to the abundance of suitable data and as a stringent test case, given past studies finding limited evidence for codon adaptation. The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage that is driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species. This can be estimated from only a single genome, without polymorphism or mutation rate data for that species.
Sepsis is a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), resulting in millions of deaths worldwide each year. The condition is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory immune response, highlighting the need for strategies to target inflammation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a key mediator of inflammation, released by both host cells and bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. This study investigated the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its role in sepsis pathogenesis. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), the researchers found that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane and impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane, which is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, the local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase that hydrolyzes ATP to be released. The results showed that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. Furthermore, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulate expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. The study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. E. coli, a frequent facultative pathogen in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP in a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis. The study found that ATP release is dependent on ATP generation and that released bacterial ATP suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsens survival in a model of abdominal sepsis. The mode of action of released bacterial ATP is limited to the immediate cellular vicinity due to rapid metabolism in the extracellular space. The study also investigated the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or blood, in the context of local and systemic infections. The results show that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner, with E. coli releasing notably more cumulative ATP compared to E. faecalis and S. aureus. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its role in sepsis pathogenesis to develop effective strategies to target inflammation and improve patient outcomes.
The relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in children and the risk of developing psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders has been well-documented. However, the underlying factors contributing to this association are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of PLEs in children, with a focus on the mediating effect of cognitive intelligence. A large-scale longitudinal dataset of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study was used to examine the relationships between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and PLEs.

The study found that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs were significantly associated with lower polygenic scores (PGSs) for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial socioeconomic status (SES), lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence was found to mediate the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. The study also found that higher PGSs for cognitive capacity phenotypes were significantly correlated with higher intelligence.

The study employed a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes PGSs, familial and neighborhood SES, and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. The results were adjusted for ethnicity, schizophrenia PGS, and unobserved confounders using computational confound modeling. The study's findings suggest that improving school and family environments, as well as promoting local economic development, may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

The study's results have important implications for policy and intervention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of psychosis and other mental disorders in children. By highlighting the mediating role of cognitive intelligence in the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs, the study underscores the importance of early interventions that target cognitive development and environmental factors. The study's findings also suggest that supportive parenting and positive school environments are critical in reducing the risk of PLEs in children.
This study investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling in human cerebral organoids, a three-dimensional in vitro model of early fetal telencephalic development. The researchers found that FGF8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains within multi-regional organoids. FGF8 was shown to affect the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in telencephalic regions, resulting in altered spontaneous neuronal network activity.

    Transcriptomic analysis revealed that FGF8 treatment induced the expression of ventral telencephalic genes, such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3, while downregulating dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2. This suggests that FGF8 signaling promotes ventral identity in telencephalic territories. The study also found that FGF8 treatment led to the development of multi-regional organoids with distinct co-developing brain domains, including dorsal and ventral telencephalon, diencephalic, and mesencephalic regions.

    Furthermore, FGF8 was shown to modulate genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including NR2F1, which is an evolutionarily conserved target of FGF8 signaling. The study proposes that FGF8-mediated modulation of key developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior telencephalic axes. The ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes was found to vary based on the regional identity of the FGF8-exposed cells, highlighting the complexity of FGF8 signaling in human cerebral organoids.

    Overall, this study demonstrates that FGF8 signaling plays a critical role in regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids, as well as in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying human brain development and may have implications for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.
The development of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is a critical process that enables the emergence of long-term memory capabilities at the 3rd instar larval stage (L3). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. This study investigates the role of nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. The results show that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding behaviors are spread across the day, but by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3), these behaviors become organized into daily patterns. Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit long-term memory (LTM). Furthermore, the development of the clock (DN1a)-arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. The study also demonstrates that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. The findings suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. In adult Drosophila, Dh44 neurons act as nutrient sensors to regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression through the activity of both glucose and amino acid sensing genes. The emergence of daily sleep-wake patterns in Drosophila larvae is regulated by developmental changes in energetic capacity, and Dh44 neurons may be necessary for sensing of larval nutritional environments. The development of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3, resulting in the emergence of LTM capabilities at the L3 stage but not before. The study identifies the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae.
The study investigated the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements in schools of giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) by characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions. The results show that fish schools exhibit a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second. In comparison to solitary fish, schools of fish reduce total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56%. When swimming at their maximum sustained speed, fish in schools demonstrated a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, resulting in a 53% reduction in TEE and total cost of transport. Additionally, fish in schools recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The study suggests that the non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance, which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These findings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes. The study provides direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements in fish schools. The results support the hypothesis that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority (greater than 50%) of their aerobic capacity. The study directly measured both aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fishes over a wide range of water velocities (0.3–8.0 body lengths per second) and compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. The findings indicate that fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate–speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range (0.3–3 body lengths per second), with no statistical difference in aerobic locomotor cost between solitary fish and fish schools at these speeds. However, fish schools swimming at approximately 1.0 body length per second consume less energy than at slower speeds.
The study investigated the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of human airway macrophages (AM) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) priming. These cytokines are associated with the Th1 and Th2 immune responses, respectively. The researchers found that human macrophages, regardless of origin, exhibited a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation, unlike MDM, which shifted to a "Warburg-like" metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM, and blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) significantly reduced IFN-γ-driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. The study provides evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
For the first time in any animal, nocturnal bull ants have been shown to use the dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The study demonstrates that these ants can detect polarised moonlight and use it as a compass cue to navigate home during the night, even when the sun is hidden by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. This ability has been theorised to be present in other nocturnal insects, but this study provides the first behavioural evidence of its use in goal-directed navigation. Nocturnal bull ants typically leave their nest at twilight and rely on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate, but many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. The study shows that these ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. The ants can detect polarised moonlight throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Furthermore, the study reveals that the ants incorporate polarised moonlight into their path integration system throughout the night, similar to how they incorporate polarised sunlight during the day. This suggests that polarised moonlight is processed through the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight, allowing the ants to use the same underlying neural architecture for both cues. The study provides evidence that nocturnal bull ants use polarised moonlight as a reliable compass cue for navigation, even when the sun is not visible. The findings have implications for our understanding of the visual ecology of nocturnal insects and the evolution of celestial navigation in animals.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that allowed them to shift their center of mass and potentially benefit flight control. The tails of early pterosaurs ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that could compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. To maintain stiffness in the vane, early pterosaurs likely employed a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system. However, the mechanism behind this system remained unclear, particularly since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. To address this knowledge gap, researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to examine the tail vanes of over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence, revealing a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. This lattice supported a dynamic tensioning system that maintained vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure. The findings suggest that the tail vanes of early pterosaurs played a crucial role in flight control and display, and that the loss of vanes in later pterosaurs and their absence in birds and bats may be related to changes in flight style or other factors. The discovery of the cross-linking lattice provides new insights into the biomechanics of early pterosaur flight and highlights the importance of tail vanes in the evolution of vertebrate flight.
Adolescence is a critical period of development characterized by significant changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie these behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. This study aimed to investigate the differences in dopamine release and the mechanisms underlying differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent and adult male rats.

The study used fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release in the NAc core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. The results showed baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood.

The study also found that blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that the α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. This was confirmed using microdialysis in awake rats. The results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

The study highlights the complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release by GABA and nAChRs, which may be age/developmental stage-dependent. The findings suggest that stimulated dopamine release is decreased in the NAc core of early adolescent male rats, and this decrease is mediated by a GABA mechanism involving α6-containing nAChRs. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms driving age-related differences in dopamine release and may have implications for understanding the development of psychiatric disorders.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical and etiological features. Recent studies using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) from individuals with ASD have revealed common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration across two distinct subtypes: idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion. Notably, despite the absence of genetic overlap between the two subtypes, a comprehensive phospho-proteome screen identified hundreds of shared phospho-peptides, including alterations in the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling dysregulation was confirmed in NPCs from both subtypes and was found to drive the developmental defects associated with ASD. Furthermore, modulation of the mTOR pathway rescued ASD phenotypes in both subtypes and reproduced autism-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. These findings suggest that mTOR signaling dysregulation is a shared pathogenic mechanism underlying the common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration observed in genetically distinct ASD subtypes. The ERK/MAPK and PKA pathways were also found to be enriched in the p-proteome analyses, indicating that altered cellular signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The study highlights the importance of mTOR dysregulation in driving autism-associated phenotypes and provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD. Gain and loss of function studies demonstrated that increasing mTOR pathway activity rescued ASD defects in individuals with low mTOR levels, while reducing mTOR pathway activity reproduced autism NPC phenotypes. Conversely, decreasing p-S6 in high mTOR ASD NPCs rescued ASD NPC phenotypes, further supporting the role of mTOR dysregulation in ASD. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of ASD pathogenesis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this complex disorder.
This study investigated the relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity in the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. The researchers used ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. The results showed that synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (SR) were predominantly found on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. The study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. The findings support the presynaptic hypothesis of functional SGN diversity and highlight the importance of synaptic heterogeneity in the encoding of acoustic information in the cochlea. The study used step depolarizations to emulate physiological receptor potentials given that mature IHCs of the ‘high-frequency’ mouse cochlea have graded receptor potentials that primarily represent the rectified envelope of an acoustic stimulus. The researchers compared the physiology of afferent synapses with high and low SR by adapting stimulation protocols routinely employed for in vivo characterization of sound encoding by SGNs. The results suggest that synaptic heterogeneity is a candidate mechanism for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information. However, caution is needed when comparing ex vivo and in vivo data due to the partial disruption of the physiological milieu and incomplete synaptic maturation. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea.
The study investigates the role of Microrchidia (MORC) proteins in the lifecycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. MORC proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across various kingdoms, including plants and animals. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and complementary molecular and genomics approaches, the researchers demonstrate that PfMORC, the MORC protein in P. falciparum, plays a crucial role in modulating chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite's erythrocytic cycle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments reveal that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies show that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite's heterochromatin structure, leading to its death. These findings confirm that PfMORC is essential for parasite survival and validate it as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies. The study also sheds light on the genome-wide distribution and function of PfMORC throughout the parasite's lifecycle, which was previously elusive. The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite's intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validated the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. The study provides powerful evidence that PfMORC is critical for parasite cell cycle progression and survival, and has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation.
Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, researchers found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors, including decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running, indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. These findings suggest that tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior, independently of pain. The elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, but also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. The study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit that extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. The neural connection between tumor and brain, together with the finding that TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons within this circuit become functionally altered, might contribute to the poor mental health experienced by cancer patients and survivors. Overall, the study highlights the importance of unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain to develop targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.
The study examines the impact of genetic diversity on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in SARS-CoV-2, a highly expressed and multifunctional protein in the virus. By analyzing the large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers found that variations in the physicochemical parameters of the protein's extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for local plasticity, but also impose functional constraints similar to those observed in related coronaviruses. Biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants revealed that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal effects, influencing thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs were found to have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties and creating a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. The study suggests that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, particularly in the IDRs. The researchers used computational methods to evaluate the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum, as well as related coronaviruses. Biophysical experiments with several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern characterized their variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and liquid-liquid phase separation propensity. The study found that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties. The results provide insights into the salient mechanisms of N-protein functions and the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution, and highlight the importance of exploring the emerging mutational landscape and sequence space to uncover the functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.
The study aimed to investigate whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization in small and large mammal species. The researchers isolated muscle fibers from hibernating Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, Eliomys quercinus, Ursus arctos, and Ursus americanus and conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. The results showed that myosin structure was preserved in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, while in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor led to higher levels of energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20°C). However, when the experiments were repeated at 8°C, a temperature closer to the body temperature of torpid animals, myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. The study also observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemlineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. The results suggest that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle, and that it is further altered in response to cold exposure. The study highlights myosin as a potential contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.
This study investigated the role of chondrocyte columns in bone elongation by analyzing the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice. Chondrocyte columns are a hallmark of growth plate architecture and are thought to drive bone elongation. However, the authors found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that gives rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. The authors used a modified version of 3D MAPs to analyze the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice. They found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate, and that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is also rare in the embryonic growth plate. The authors discovered that the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate correlate with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion. This suggests that clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development. The study highlights the importance of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements and provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. The findings suggest that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determine the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Overall, the study provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are a family of transporters that play a crucial role in the oral bioavailability of various drugs due to their promiscuous substrate binding site. Recent cryo-EM structures and alphafold models of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, have provided new insights into their conformational states. However, these studies have left open questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling. To address these questions, the authors employed extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces.

    The simulations computed conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, identifying a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. Key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs were also identified, which were validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays. The results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations established a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underlying secondary active transport in POTs.

    The study provides a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs. To investigate the mechanism underpinning peptide-proton coupling, the authors constructed simulation boxes with a bound Ala-Phe substrate molecule and calculated the Ala-Phe affinity using ABFE simulations in different protein states. The results showed that the affinity is similar in the OF and IF states, indicating that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from OF to IF. Enhanced sampling simulations were then employed to obtain conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation state and substrate binding conditions.

    The simulations revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides, with distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism. POT family transporters belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and share a conserved topology of two six-helix bundles that form the functional transport domain, with their N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasm. The study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and paves the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.
The neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization across the animal kingdom, including humans. This suppression is thought to increase sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. However, a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings were obtained from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. The results showed that auditory suppression varied across the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ), with overlapping sites exhibiting both suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. A strong correlation was found between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting that suppression might be a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring. Furthermore, when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if they were engaged in a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) paradigm, indicating that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. These findings support the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in humans, and provide evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring. The results also suggest that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions can increase feedback sensitivity and elicit larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal speech production. The study used intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings in neurosurgical participants to achieve a high level of spatial detail and temporal precision, allowing for the identification of sites that show auditory suppression during speech production and sensitivity to perturbed feedback. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human speech monitoring and the role of auditory suppression in detecting and correcting speech errors.
A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, a type of prokaryotic Type IV restriction system, has been conducted, revealing their widespread presence in diverse prokaryotes and numerous genomic associations. A previously uncharacterized branch of McrBC systems, denoted as coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoCoNuTs), has been identified, characterized by extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. CoCoNuTs exhibit remarkable diversity, comprising three distinct types and multiple subtypes, each with unique domain compositions and genomic associations.

CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, including OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein, YTH-like domains, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, as well as RNases such as HEPN domains. These features suggest that CoCoNuTs target RNA. Additionally, some CoCoNuTs may target DNA via McrC nuclease homologs. CoCoNuTs are often encoded in the same predicted superoperons as other restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind associated CARF domains.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that CoCoNuTs, along with ancillary restriction factors, may employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. This strategy involves an initial immune response eliminating viral DNA and/or RNA, followed by an abortive infection response leading to programmed cell death (PCD) or dormancy via host RNA cleavage if the initial response fails.

Further investigation of CoCoNuTs has shown that they contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, including SmpB-like OB-folds, Hsp70 homologs, and YTH domains, as well as RNases such as HEPN. This suggests that at least one activity of these systems targets RNA. The RNA targeting capability of certain CoCoNuT types can be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. The conserved association of CDC48-like ATPases with Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which encode the potentially tmRNA-binding SPB domain, provides support for the scenario of tmRNA interaction.
This study investigated the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity and lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Calcineurin is a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in various cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. The researchers found that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans, and its inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Notably, the intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The study also identified the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, as required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Furthermore, the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, was found to be upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and necessary for the increased lifespan. These findings uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension. Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, which activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of calmodulin. The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves. The relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood. The study highlights the importance of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans innate immunity and provides insights into the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity.
The present study aimed to investigate the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation using a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. According to the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. The study hypothesized that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space. To test this hypothesis, the researchers designed a task with five types of conflicts and measured human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results showed that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, suggesting that cognitive space is a principle for representing conflicts. The study also found that the distance between the points in the cognitive space scales with the difference in the sources of the conflicts being represented by the points. This suggests that the dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be the aforementioned domains, in which domain-specific cognitive control processes are defined. For a specific type of conflict, its location in the cognitive space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, which reflect how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes. The cognitive space can also represent different types of conflicts with low dimensionality. The study further hypothesized that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts may be located in the frontoparietal network due to its essential roles in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving different conflict types were proposed, differing based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. The domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment.
The study aimed to investigate the vaginal immune response in pregnant women at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), which is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The researchers collected vaginal swabs from 739 women across gestation and analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. The results showed that the vaginal immunoproteome, or the collection of immune molecules in the vagina, has a homeostatic profile during uncomplicated gestation. However, in women who ultimately experienced spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL) or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), the vaginal immunoproteome was skewed towards a pro-inflammatory state. This inflammatory profile was characterized by increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The study found that the vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early (less than 34 weeks) sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome underwent homeostatic changes throughout gestation, and deviations from this shift were associated with sPTB. The study suggests that the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes. The research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NICHD/NIH/DHHS) under contract HHSN275201300006C. The study also received support from the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and Child Health.
The Hernandez–Hernandez model is a novel in silico model of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes that aims to describe the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. The model is based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The results suggest that KV1. 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, but simulations indicate that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In contrast, KV2. 1 channels play a primary role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes, which have larger KV2. 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes. The model predicts that the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels drives sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability over the physiological range of membrane potentials. Furthermore, the model suggests that female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. The Hernandez–Hernandez model also predicts that clinically used antihypertensive CaV1. 2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in CaV1. 2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes. A one-dimensional ( 1D ) vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series suggests that Ca2+ channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial [Ca2+]i reduction in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez–Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in CaV1. 2 and KV2. 1 channels in the regulation of membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes. The model provides a new framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.
The study investigated the relationship between litter decomposition and precipitation levels across a sharp aridity gradient. Contrary to the expected positive association between litter decomposition and precipitation, the results showed that decomposers of different sizes responded differently to precipitation levels. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter, while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments, highlighting the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands. The findings suggest that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna result in similar overall decomposition rates across the precipitation gradient, except in hyper-arid sites where decomposers' activity is minimal. The study used litter baskets of different mesh sizes and pitfall trapping to characterize the macro-decomposer assemblages across the aridity gradient. The results support the hypothesis that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts, resolving the long-suggested but largely overlooked dryland decomposition conundrum. The study emphasizes the need to consider decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes and highlights the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands. The findings have significant implications for understanding the role of decomposers in shaping ecosystem processes in arid environments. The study's results suggest that macro-decomposers play a crucial role in decomposing plant litter in arid ecosystems, and their activity peaks in arid environments. The opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers lead to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationships between decomposers, precipitation, and litter decomposition in arid ecosystems.
The study investigated the role of CYRI-B in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all PDAC tumours drives RAC1 activation, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity, as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signalling receptors is not well understood. The study found that CYRI-B is highly expressed in PDAC tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib, the gene encoding CYRI-B protein, accelerated tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions. However, as the disease progressed, loss of CYRI-B inhibited metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells showed reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. The study implicated CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis. In the KPC mouse model, loss of Cyrib accelerated PanIN formation and progression, likely due to the loss of CYRI-B's capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS, leading to abnormal architecture and hyperactivation of ERK and JNK to drive proliferation. CYRI-B localised on macropinosomes in pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting a possible mechanism for how CYRI-B loss could affect tumour progression. The study suggests that CYRI-B plays a complex role in pancreatic cancer, acting as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages, but inhibiting metastasis as the disease progresses.
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have integrated into the human genome over millions of years. HERV-K (HML-2) is the youngest clade of HERVs, characterized by the presence of intact or nearly intact proviruses. However, no replication-competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. In contrast, HML-2-related proviruses have been found in other primates, including rhesus macaques. A recent study has identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. The age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques.

The study found that 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an approximately 750-base pair sequence between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K (HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM) but not great apes, indicating it originated after the ape/OWM split. Similar proviruses were also identified in white-cheeked gibbons, which cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons.

The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in the U3 region, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. However, the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

The study also characterized a clade of HERV-K HML-2-related ERVs in rhesus macaques and other OWMs that include an approximately 750-base pair non-coding region between env and the 3' LTR, derived from a recombination with a HERV-K11 HML-8 retrovirus. This suggests that rhesus macaques may harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses. The study provides a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis.
The study investigated the role of Enterococcus faecalis in wound infections using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model. The analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, highlighting the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. The study identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2-like macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in the scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, the study discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, regulating chemokine signaling pathways and promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The findings suggest that E. faecalis infection induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. The study generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the host response to persistent E. faecalis wound infection, providing new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. The results offer a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing. The study also highlights the importance of immune cells in wound healing, including their role in eliminating pathogens, promoting keratinocyte and fibroblast activity, and resolving inflammation and tissue repair. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds.
The study investigated the temporal dynamics of plant defense responses in neighboring plants exposed to volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants. Using a custom-built proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) system, the researchers analyzed the volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. The results showed that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles resulted in a clocked temporal response pattern in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst was not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincided with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurred independently of day-night light transitions and could not be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it was the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. The study revealed that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence. The study suggests that responding most strongly to volatile cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The researchers propose that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day. To test this hypothesis, the researchers exposed receiver plants to volatiles from control plants or volatiles from herbivory-induced plants for 1.25 hours. They then disconnected the receiver plants and exposed them to clean air for 17 hours, until the beginning of the next day. Half of the plants were then exposed to HAC as a secondary trigger. The results showed that the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of an initial volatile burst that primes plants for higher volatile release at the onset of the second day, and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive volatiles released from sender plants at the onset of the second day. The study highlights the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real-time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors.
The article presents evidence of recursive vocal combinatorics in wild flanged male orangutans, a nonhuman great ape, in the form of rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences. These recursive structures are characterized by two hierarchical strata, where three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum are not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples. This suggests that the recursive structures are not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances. The findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. This discovery opens the possibility that recursive vocal combinatorics were first a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited and ‘re-engineered’ for the generation of linguistic combinatorics. The authors propose that second-order combinatorics, involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids, may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. Future studies on primate vocal combinatorics, particularly undertaking a structural approach and in the wild, offer promising new paths to empirically assess possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the hominid family, also adding temporal recursion as a new layer of analysis. A novel, direct approach to recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates is desirable to help infer signal patterns that were recursive in some degree or kind in an extinct past, and molded subsequently into the recursive structures observed today in humans. The authors suggest that a structural approach opens the field to potentially untapped signal diversity in nature and yet unrecognized bona fide combinatoric possibilities within the human clade. The discovery of recursive vocal patterning in a wild great ape in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music opens a new charter for possible incipient and transitional states of recursion among hominids.
The interaction between viruses and their hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that have shaped the evolution of life. A key aspect of this interaction is the relationship between viral receptors and viruses, which are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. A recent study has shed light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. The study found that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. This suggests that MDA5 has acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I. The study also found that 5’ppp-RNA SCRV virus can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. The study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. The findings suggest that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA virus in the absence of RIG-I, and that SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m6A strategy to degrade MDA5 for immune evasion. The study also provides a new perspective for vertebrate groups that have lost RIG-I, and sheds light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and the complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates. The study used Miichthys miiuy and Gallus gallus, two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, and two 5’ppp-RNA viruses, SCRV and VSV, to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The results demonstrated that the MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA, and that SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m6A strategy to degrade MDA5 for immune evasion.
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels and body composition parameters, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PC) undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Twenty-nine consecutive PC patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. Body composition parameters, including fat body mass (FBM), lean body mass (LBM), and BMD, were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM, fat mass at arms, and fat mass at trunk assessed after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was also observed. The study found that FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, particularly on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT.

This study is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and is limited by its small sample size. However, the results suggest that FSH serum levels may be associated with changes in body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. The study highlights the potential role of FSH as a marker for monitoring the risk of sarcopenic obesity and guiding clinicians in the evaluation of body composition in PC patients. The findings of this study are hypothesis-generating and require further investigation to confirm the relationship between FSH and body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, have been underexplored in this context. Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD, and improves contractile function.

To test this hypothesis, a guinea pig model was used that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic heart failure (HF), including a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. The incidence of VT/VF and SCD, ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation were assessed.

The results showed that DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigated the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improved contractile function. These findings suggest that RyR2 inhibition with dantrolene may be a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.
This study investigated the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, specifically the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. The study identified functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri using ChIP-seq peaks and RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. The results showed that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA-9 directing both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppressed the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. The findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. The study used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva. The analysis revealed that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate target genes that they independently and exclusively regulate. ChIP-seq data demonstrated that 73.7% of SMA-3 binding peaks overlap with SMA-9 binding sites, while approximately half of all SMA-9 binding sites did not overlap with SMA-3 sites. The study also identified SMA-9-exclusive target genes that imply Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in functions such as immunity, consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity.
The study investigated the role of the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 in cancer immune evasion and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. DUX4 was previously identified as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation in a small subset of primary tumors. This study found that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. The expression of DUX4 was significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. Furthermore, DUX4 expression was a significant predictor of survival in this cohort, with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features. The study also found that DUX4 expression in advanced urothelial carcinoma tumors was associated with an immune exclusion phenotype, characterized by a higher proportion of immune-excluded or immune-desert tumors compared to those without DUX4 expression. Additionally, DUX4 expression was correlated with reduced PD-L1 levels in the tumor and immune compartments. The study suggests that DUX4 expression in metastatic cancers induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, consistent with its established function in inhibiting JAK–STAT signaling in primary cancers. The high rates of DUX4 expression observed across metastatic cancer cohorts were found to be consistent with expression of a polyadenylated DUX4 transcript in both primary and metastatic cancers. The study highlights the potential of DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance in metastatic cancers, particularly in urothelial carcinoma.
The study aimed to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in Tanzania by establishing a surveillance platform in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Between 2017 and 2019, 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats were reported by farmers to livestock field officers and investigated by research teams. The study found that attribution of the causes of abortion was achieved in 19.5% of cases, which was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid sample deterioration, while vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection, and application of molecular diagnostic platforms. The findings suggest that livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study also highlights the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. The study's results have implications for establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa. Non-infectious conditions, including nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions, are also likely to cause livestock abortions in Tanzania, and recent stressful events, such as drought and wild predator attacks, may play a role in unattributed abortion cases. The study's findings contribute to the limited information available on current practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities of livestock abortion surveillance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
This study investigated the effects of nicotine ( NIC ) on murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and its potential role in the development of intestinal tumors. The results show that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of ISCs in vivo and ex vivo. This effect is mediated by the activation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ), leading to the induction of Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs. Notably, this effect was not observed in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. Furthermore, NIC enhanced in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. These findings suggest that NIC triggers a pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs, and that DBZ may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. The study also highlights the role of NIC as a stimulant of cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, which may explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. The results indicate that blocking the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling pathways may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers. The study contributes to the understanding of how stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggests an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.
The Hsp70 chaperone system plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which are associated with stress, aging, and disease. Hsp70 solubilizes aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones, including J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study elucidates the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. The results show that Hsp110 plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining the final efficacy of the process. Hsp110 catalyzes the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto the aggregate surface, modifying aggregates into smaller species that are more readily processed by chaperones. The NEF stimulation of Hsp70 is stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, the study demonstrates for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction, which might improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. The balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential. Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages, including chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding. The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase. The study also shows that the positive effect of the Hsp110 NEF on protein recovery from aggregates is substantially more pronounced when the Hsp70 chaperone system comprises a class B JDP.
Biomedical research has shown that gait impairments are common in individuals with musculoskeletal conditions such as knee arthropathy. Gait analysis is a valuable tool in clinical practice for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression or response to interventions. However, traditional clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking, as objective gait analysis has been limited by the need for expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff. Wearable digital insoles have been proposed as a potential solution to these challenges. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using digital insoles to measure osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures and compare them to traditional gait-lab standards. A machine learning model was constructed and trained on force plate data collected from participants with knee arthropathy and controls. The model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set and a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects. The results showed that digital insole-derived gait characteristics were comparable to traditional gait measurements. Furthermore, a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, indicating that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This study provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods and supports the development of at-home gait assessments. The findings have the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring. A support vector machine model was used to differentiate controls versus knee arthropathies using vertical ground reaction force ( vGRF ) data from force plates. The model was trained on 85% of the vGRF force plate dataset and tested on the remaining 15%. The results showed that the model was highly predictive of knee arthropathy status. The study also aimed to clinically validate the measurement of gait with digital insoles in individuals with knee arthropathy. A novel machine learning framework was developed based on gold-standard force plate data to detect knee arthropathy status using digital insoles. The results showed that the digital insole-derived gait outcomes and raw sensor signals could identify disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy. The study highlights the potential of wearable digital insoles for gait analysis in knee osteoarthritis and provides a foundation for further research in this area.
The article reports on the development of a non-opioid therapy for managing post-surgical pain using a human amniotic membrane (AM) product called Clarix Flo (FLO). FLO, a naturally derived biologic from human birth tissues, was found to attenuate established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice without causing the severe side effects associated with opioid analgesics. This effect was achieved through the direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. The researchers further purified the major matrix component, heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), from human AM, which exhibited greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons. These findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, the study unravels the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. The study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain, and HC-HA/PTX3 is identified as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. HC-HA/PTX3 induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. The researchers used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO, and found that HC-HA/PTX3 mimics FLO in its ability to inhibit pain behavior and has higher purity and greater water solubility compared to FLO. These findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control, such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD, and fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties.
The study investigated the relationship between the color intensity of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (iPSC-RPE) and their gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. The researchers utilized the Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System (ALPS) to photograph each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. The iPSC-RPE cells were categorized into four clusters based on gene expression, but the color intensity of the cells did not correlate with any specific gene expression profiles. This suggests that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics. The study also found that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, and there is a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of enzymes, and synthesis of melanin. Furthermore, the study found that gene sets related to retinoid recycling, an important feature of RPE cells, showed weak correlation with the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells. The results suggest that in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation. For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted, and iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared become heavily pigmented after engraftment. These findings imply that the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition rather than a strong indicator of their functional characteristics. The study highlights the importance of considering the dynamic regulation of pigmentation in RPE cells and the need for further investigation into the underlying biological mechanisms.
The field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, a novel behavioral apparatus called the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ) was developed. MarmoAAP is designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets and addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings. This allows for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. The apparatus also provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. It bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism. The combination of a highly modular and adaptable design, high-resolution behavioral data, and integration with neural recordings positions MarmoAAP as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior. By incorporating behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with the timing of marmosets’ pulling behaviors and reward delivery, one can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in this species. MarmoAAP significantly increases the number of trials available for analysis and thus ensures ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors. The apparatus and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP.
The study aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on genome regulation in the developing offspring using a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate PAE. The results showed that early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential, indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation.

    Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) suggested that some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. The study also found that a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. These findings demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.

    The study employed a controlled intervention design, comparing exposed and unexposed mice, with an additional arm comparing the effect of alcohol exposure in the context of a high-maternal-diet (HMD) maternal diet. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was used for unbiased assessment of CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol. The exposure period covered the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition. The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation, and secondary outcomes of behavioral deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD were also examined.

    The study found that regions identified as sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure were replicated in human cohorts. DNA methylation array data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) cohort were analyzed, and no evidence of differential DNA methylation was found at CpG sites corresponding to mouse differentially methylated regions (DMRs). However, in the murine model, alcohol effects on DNA methylation were predominantly tissue-specific, with only two genomic regions and four genes that were similarly affected in both liver and brain. These perturbations may have been established stochastically due to PAE to the early embryo and maintained in the differentiating tissue.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) -mediated RNA interference ( RNAi ) is a powerful tool for silencing a wide range of genes. However, previous studies have shown that the loss of certain regulators of RNAi can selectively impair the silencing of specific genes, suggesting that not all genes are equivalent targets for RNAi. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers have identified an intersecting network of regulators that act on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. This network includes the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3. The study found that any two of these proteins are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. Notably, the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. The researchers used quantitative models and simulations to explore the dynamics of RNAi and found that changing the cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3. They also discovered that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells and that cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. These findings suggest that crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. The study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of RNAi and highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of target genes in RNAi experiments. The results also have implications for the development of RNAi-based therapies in plants, insects, and humans, where gene-specific factors may influence the functional outcome of RNAi.
The study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) pathogenesis and mortality by analyzing whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, and 30 healthy controls. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, the researchers identified hub genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality. A consensus analysis revealed distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. The study found that increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were linked to TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—were identified as strong predictors of TBM mortality. These findings suggest that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death. The study also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. The researchers employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, followed by logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose the best predictors. The study's results provide insights for potential therapeutic targets and a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes in TBM patients. Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality stratified by HIV status showed that HIV-negative individuals had 786 differentially expressed genes, while HIV-positive individuals had 1620 differentially expressed genes. The study's findings suggest that host transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality differ according to HIV status. The study's results highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of TBM pathogenesis and mortality to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
Antibodies are essential reagents in biomedical research for detecting and characterizing proteins. However, a significant proportion of commercial antibodies fail to recognize their intended targets. To address this issue, researchers developed a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins. The study found that more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, but approximately 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody. This suggests that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The study also identified hundreds of underperforming antibodies that had been used in numerous published articles, highlighting the need for improved antibody validation. Encouragingly, many manufacturers reassessed these underperforming antibodies and made changes to their recommended usage or removed them from the market. The study provides an efficient strategy for achieving coverage of the human proteome by mining the existing commercial antibody repertoire and using the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. The researchers developed optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence applications and tested 614 commercially available antibodies against 65 human proteins. The results suggest that approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody. The study provides an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for representing and comparing antibody performance, estimating the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, and assessing the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods.
The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is a significant need in the field of inter-organ communication studies. To address this need, researchers have developed technologies that combine the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary expression system, such as the LexA system or QF system. This summary describes a resource of reagents that facilitate the combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues. The authors generated a set of over 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. They also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, allowing for the isolation of fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, the authors evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown using new compatible shRNA vectors and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. These LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. This resource will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously. The authors used CRISPR-based HDR to generate LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions in a set of genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, encompassing most of the major organs of the fly. They selected genes that had previously characterized GAL4 insertions and strong evidence of tissue specificity from publicly available scRNAseq, in situ, and immunohistochemistry data. The resulting LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions were verified for tissue specificity in larvae. The authors also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, allowing for the isolation of fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. This resource will facilitate the study of inter-organ communication and provide a new set of tools for Drosophila researchers.
The transcription factor Bcl11b plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is essential for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Bcl11b regulates mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. The researchers found that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b and regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, they demonstrated that C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. These findings identify a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown that Bcl11b is essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. The researchers have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and hippocampal learning and memory. In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses. This study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of mossy fiber synapse function. The researchers found that reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant DGN, rescues the structural and functional changes of mossy fiber synapses caused by Bcl11b ablation. This study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction.
The zinc-finger protein Sfp1 plays a crucial role in regulating the transcription of proliferation-related genes by interacting with the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries. The study reveals that Sfp1 can regulate transcription by binding to both promoters and transcribed regions (gene bodies) of the DNA. When Sfp1 binds to promoters, it affects the configuration of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), leading to dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Furthermore, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin. The study also shows that Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol II.

    Sfp1's co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs. The study proposes that following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1's relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. The interplay between Sfp1's two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined.

    The study provides evidence that Sfp1 impacts the mRNA life cycle, from transcription to degradation. Sfp1's effect on transcription elongation is linked to its function on mRNA stabilization, suggesting that all its functions are connected. The binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies correlates with Pol II occupancy in all genes, and the general capacity of Sfp1 to alter elongating Pol II in the context of Rpb4 and to affect backtracking likely underlies its widespread effect on transcription.

    The study also shows that Sfp1's function in a subset of its target genes extends beyond transcription initiation and encompasses transcription elongation. The interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin has an effect on both Pol II elongation and mRNA half-lives, suggesting a mechanistic linkage. The study proposes that backtracking is associated with co-transcriptional binding of Sfp1 to nascent RNA. Reassuringly, RiBi genes that exhibit Sfp1-dependent backtracking also imprint Sfp1, whereas those that do not also do not imprint. Unexpectedly, in addition to its chromatin binding feature, Sfp1 binds a subpopulation of mRNAs whose transcription is stimulated by Sfp1.
This study investigated the relationship between programmed cell death (PCD) during plant development (dPCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The researchers focused on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations in both dPCD regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This suggests that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root.

    Reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells. This indicates a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. The study proposes that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. S. indica was found to downregulate BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. The results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.

    Transcriptome analysis was performed to track developmental cell death-marker gene expression during different colonization stages. The major regulator in LRCs, SMB, showed no significant changes in expression during fungal colonization. However, a significant decrease in BFN1 expression was observed after 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica. Reporter lines showed a reduction in promoter activity in epidermal cells that were in contact with the fungus compared with mock-treated roots. BFN1 expression and nuclear localization in the root cap or xylem was not affected by S. indica colonization. These findings suggest that beneficial microbes can manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation by S. indica remains to be investigated.
Biomedical research has identified large vesicle extrusion from neurons, known as exophers, as a potential mechanism contributing to neurodegenerative disease through the spreading of pathogenic protein aggregates and inflammatory responses. In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), proteostressed neurons produce exophers, but the factors regulating this process are poorly understood. This study investigated the role of mechanical force in exopher extrusion from C. elegans neurons. The results show that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. The study also found that genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths, while those that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. Furthermore, the study suggests that the mechanical force of uterine occupation, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, is the stimulus for exopher extrusion. This is supported by the finding that filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid can enhance ALMR exopher production. The study concludes that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons, highlighting the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and aggregate spreading mechanisms. These findings make a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
The study investigated the role of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), a secreted Wnt antagonist, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DKK3 was found to be upregulated in the brains of AD patients and increased at early stages of the disease. In AD mouse models, extracellular DKK3 levels were elevated, and DKK3 accumulated at dystrophic neuronal processes around amyloid plaques. Functionally, DKK3 was shown to trigger the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway and a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restored synapse number and memory in AD mouse models. The study demonstrated that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways. DKK3 loss-of-function was found to ameliorate synaptic defects in AD mouse models, supporting the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in AD. Furthermore, DKK3 was shown to directly affect the integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and its knockdown did not affect the number or size of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus. The study suggests that DKK3 is a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD, and its dysregulation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying synaptic vulnerability in AD and highlight the potential of DKK3 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.
In response to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, researchers have turned to natural compounds produced by microbes to inhibit bacterial pathogens. A recent study investigated the antibacterial properties of pyoverdines, iron-chelating siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. The study screened 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens and identified several pyoverdines with high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Furthermore, pyoverdine increased the survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. These findings suggest that pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. The study proposes that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition. The researchers screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, the chemical structure was elucidated to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition. The study applied the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens, focusing on pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. When administered as treatment to infected G. mellonella larvae, the study observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts. The study also found low toxicity of pyoverdines at effective concentrations and observed low potentials for resistance evolution. Overall, the results reveal pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. as a promising new class of antibacterials against specific human pathogens.
Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by a failure of prefrontal networks, but the exact mechanisms underlying this failure are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have shown that disruptions in synaptic function contribute to the development of schizophrenia, but the link between these disruptions and network-level failures remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits to investigate the relationship between N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) synaptic function and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia.

The model revealed that the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influences oscillatory spike synchrony. Specifically, reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as those that occur during behavior. This finding parallels the dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this synchrony by administration of NMDAR antagonists.

The results of this study establish a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism explaining how the reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits. The model shows that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking between individual prefrontal neurons when external inputs to the network push it across this state boundary, and the failure of synchronous spiking to emerge between prefrontal neurons when NMDAR synaptic currents are reduced.

These findings provide a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. The model also highlights the importance of slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input in influencing spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA synaptic transmission.
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is a morphogenic process that typically occurs in hypoxic micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis involve the differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, which is controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are not fully understood. To investigate this process, a controlled experimental angiogenesis model was combined with mathematical and computational analyses. The results show that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. This transition leads to robust but temporally unstable differentiation, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. Furthermore, sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. The study suggests that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation that enables but does not instruct subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. The findings of this analysis can contribute to a better understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip–Stalk fate in future models of angiogenesis. The results support a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. However, the inputs specifying cell fate can be contradictory, leading to complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood. The study provides a framework for further investigation into the mechanisms of angiogenesis and other complex multicellular processes, such as collective epithelial migration.
The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brain region that plays a critical role in learning and memory, particularly in the hippocampus. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and the specific neurotransmitters involved in memory formation in the hippocampus are not well understood. The LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity through the release of norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. This study aimed to investigate the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. The results show that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. The study also found that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus, and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not. These findings suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long-term memory formation. The study provides direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the hippocampus, and that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not. The results support the idea that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning. The LC and its interaction with the hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation, but the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood. This study provides new insights into the role of the LC in learning and memory, and highlights the importance of dopamine release from the LC in trace fear memory formation.
