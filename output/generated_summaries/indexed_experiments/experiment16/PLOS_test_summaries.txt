Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of cases of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), also known as sleeping sickness, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades. Despite this progress, pockets of infection remain, and it is essential to assess which regions are on track for elimination and where intervention efforts should be focused. A previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the DRC was used to analyze data from 16 health areas in the Mosango health zone in Kwilu province. This analysis was the first time a stochastic gHAT model was fitted directly to case data, allowing for a better understanding of the uncertainty in the results. The study used a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to fit the model to the data. The results showed that the health area of Kinzamba II, which accounts for approximately one-third of the health zone's cases, is expected to have the latest year for elimination of transmission (EoT) under current intervention strategies. The study also found that fitting a deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC had faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model, but produced virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterization. This suggests that expanding health area fitting to cover more of the DRC should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency, but with stochastic projections used to capture both parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) to better understand cancer and predict patient outcomes. TMEs contain a vast amount of information about a patient's cancer, including the cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cells. By exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, researchers can identify specific interactions that are useful in making predictions about patient survival and treatment success with emerging immunotherapies.

The new approach uses spatial K functions to summarize the relationships between different cell types in the TME. It then applies functional data analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach was tested on simulated data and found to be effective in identifying important spatial interactions while controlling the false discovery rate.

The researchers applied this approach to two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. In the triple negative breast cancer data, the approach was used to compare two groups of tumors that were separated into "compartmentalized" and "mixed" groups based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions. The results showed that the approach was able to identify significant differences between the two groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes and protein antigens.

The new approach is publicly available in a companion R package called "funkycells" and can be used to analyze TME data from various cancer types. It has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer biology and guide therapeutic interventions.
Researchers investigated how abnormal neural synchronization, a phenomenon observed in several brain disorders, affects brain function. They used computational models to study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure interact and evolve during synchronization and desynchronization processes. The study focused on the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), on network behavior.

The researchers created a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with varying synaptic weight and structural plasticity mechanisms. They found that structural reorganization can significantly enhance network synchrony, particularly when weaker connections are eliminated through weight-dependent pruning. This process allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections than in randomly structured networks.

The study also showed that the strengthening of connections between neurons with higher firing rates and those with lower rates, followed by the removal of weak connections, enables strong synchrony. This activity-led network reorganization leads to the emergence of degree-frequency and degree-degree correlations, as well as a mixture of degree assortativity.

The researchers compared the desynchronization of synchronized states in networks with different plasticity mechanisms and found that those with a combination of STDP and structural plasticity require significantly higher stimuli to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future studies on inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have discovered a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of flatworm. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. The study found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a specific gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Later, glia are specified from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or Notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. The study suggests that patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types. This mechanism could facilitate evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system by allowing any particular neuron population to acquire or lose expression of delta-2 and have access to dispersed phagocytic progenitors. Notch signaling, which is essential for cell-fate specification and tissue patterning, plays a role in planarian glia regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal progenitors. The study proposes a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons interact with Notch-expressing phagocytic progenitors to accomplish coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV. They analyzed blood samples from individuals who were previously identified as either "broad" or "non-broad" neutralizers. The study found significant differences in the expression of certain surface markers on γδ T cells between the two groups. Specifically, participants who developed bNAbs had higher levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells during acute HIV infection (AHI). These markers were associated with the development of bNAbs years later. Additionally, the study found that the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells were linked to the early production of IgM antibodies against the HIV envelope protein. The researchers also observed that Vδ2 T cells were reduced during early AHI in participants who developed bNAbs, and this reduction was associated with higher viral loads. The study suggests that γδ T cells may play a role in promoting the development of bNAbs, which could have implications for HIV vaccine strategies. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which γδ T cells contribute to the humoral immune response against HIV. This knowledge could lead to the development of new vaccine approaches that target these cells to improve the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 Env.
Researchers have developed a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, that targets two key cell surface receptors, IL-6Rα and IL-8RB, which are involved in a synergistic pathway that drives tumor metastasis. The BS1 antibody combines the variable domains of two distinct antibodies: tocilizumab, which targets IL-6R, and 10H2, which targets IL-8R. Studies have shown that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality.

A quantitative, computational model of the BS1 bispecific antibody has been developed to understand its binding and inhibition mechanisms. The model simulates the binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, providing insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects. The results demonstrate how the balance of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes drives receptor inhibition.

Simulations of BS1 binding over a range of initial antibody concentrations and for cells with differing levels of combined IL-6R and IL-8R expression reveal that the relative amount of the two target receptors is critical for bispecific antibody binding. When IL-6R and IL-8R are present in a 1:1 ratio, bispecific antibody binding is nearly identical to the binding of the combination of anti-IL-6R and anti-IL-8R monospecific antibodies. These findings provide important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, in the assembly and stability of acentrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. Acentrosomal spindles lack centrosomes, which are essential for organizing spindles in most cell types. The study found that ZYG-8 depletion resulted in overelongated spindles with defects in pole and midspindle formation. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role for ZYG-8 in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. The study also found that ZYG-8 is required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that its kinase activity is necessary for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain, and previous studies have shown that it regulates microtubule assembly in mitotically dividing embryos. The researchers propose that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in oocytes: regulating microtubule dynamics and influencing the activity of motors that walk along microtubules to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. The study provides new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division and sheds light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles.
Researchers investigated the relationship between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and circulating metabolite levels in a large dataset from the UK Biobank. They found that 79 metabolites, mostly related to lipids and lipoproteins, have a causal association with T2D. In contrast, twice as many metabolites are affected by T2D liability, including branched-chain amino acids. This suggests that T2D has a broader impact on metabolite levels than previously thought.

The study also identified four metabolites whose genetic regulation is altered in T2D patients compared to controls. These metabolites were consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank. The genetic variants associated with these metabolites are significant in the general population but not linked to T2D risk, indicating that T2D affects the genetic regulation of metabolite levels.

Furthermore, the researchers found that 165 metabolites are associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications. However, only a few of these metabolites are causally linked to T2D, suggesting that there are biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. The study provides a comprehensive map of the consequences of T2D on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, shedding light on the T2D trajectory leading to complications.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors behind the ability of mice to tolerate Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. They crossed two mouse lines, CC061, which is highly susceptible to MRSA, and CC024, which is tolerant of the infection. The resulting F1 and F2 generations were infected with MRSA, and their survival rates were monitored. The results showed that the F1 generation had a 65% survival rate, while the F2 generation had a 55% survival rate, indicating a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the tolerant phenotype.

A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak was identified on chromosome 7, which was associated with survival and weight change after infection. The WSB/EiJ allele, present in CC024 mice, contributed to their tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, which are receptors for the complement factor C5a, were found to have high-impact variants in this region. C5a is an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response. The researchers hypothesize that altered binding of C5a to variant receptors in CC024 mice may reduce the damage caused by the cytokine storm, allowing them to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and survive longer. The study suggests that genetic factors, specifically the C5ar1 and C5ar2 genes, play a crucial role in the ability of mice to tolerate MRSA infections.
Researchers studied how genetic networks influence adaptation in populations. They used a simple gene regulatory network to model a quantitative trait and simulated adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum. The study aimed to understand how genetic interactions affect the availability of beneficial alleles and the distribution of fitness effects among mutations. The results showed that both additive and network models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. However, the network model had a more complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects, with a higher density of deleterious mutations. This suggests that genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. The study also found that the network model approached the optimum more slowly than the additive model on average. The research highlights the importance of considering genetic interactions in models of adaptation, as they can significantly impact the distribution of fitness effects and the rate of trait evolution. The findings have implications for understanding how populations adapt to changing environments and how genetic networks influence the availability of beneficial alleles. The study's approach combines the biological realism of network modeling with existing tools for studying the evolution of quantitative traits, providing new insights into the role of genetic networks in adaptation.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the brain integrates information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to optimally perform this integration according to Bayesian probability theory. In this framework, apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, such as effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances.

The researchers demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. They also derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. This theory explains various experimental findings related to multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity.

The researchers interpret the biophysics of cortical neurons as Bayesian computations, showing that conductance-based neuron models naturally compute posterior distributions from Gaussian likelihood functions and prior represented in dendritic compartments. They derive somatic membrane dynamics from stochastic gradient ascent on this posterior distribution and synaptic plasticity from matching the posterior to a target distribution. This framework predicts neuronal response properties that differ from those of classical neuron models and allows each dendritic compartment to adjust its relative reliability according to its past success in contributing to matching desired somatic distributions.
Researchers have used the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) framework to classify domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. The team was able to provide positive classification for 90% of residues in all proteomes, identifying 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins containing over 226,424,000 amino acid residues. The study found that eukaryotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions, unassigned domains, and repeated proteins compared to bacteria. However, both eukaryotes and bacteria share highly populated domains such as Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains.

The researchers compared the sampling of homologous groups from the whole proteome set to their stable ECOD reference and found that structure predictions have enriched certain groups. The study suggests that highly accurate structure predictions have facilitated convergence between sequence and structural classifications for well-understood protein families. Additionally, structural domain classification has identified domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications, particularly in less populated homologous groups.

The findings have implications for protein target selection and future classification strategies for large protein sets. The team notes that the division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or unstructured regions will continue to be a useful strategy for handling large structural datasets. The widespread access to previously difficult or unamenable proteins has dramatically diminished the gap between structural and sequence classification, expanding our knowledge of previously unknown domains.
Researchers have shed new light on the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure for which there is currently no antiviral treatment. Using single-cell analysis, the study found that BKPyV requires an initial host cell S phase to express its large T antigen (TAg) and produce viral particles. This contradicts the previous model, which suggested that TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the initial S phase for viral replication. Instead, the study found that robust TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial host S phase. The researchers also discovered that BKPyV promotes cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase without passing through mitosis or G1 phase, to prolong S phase for viral replication. This results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. The study found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA rely on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators, despite BKPyV infection. The findings suggest a new model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. This new understanding of the molecular events required for BKPyV production may help identify effective therapeutic targets against the virus. The study's results also align with the replication mechanisms of other small DNA tumor viruses, such as papilloma- and adenoviruses.
Researchers have developed a new method called FABIO, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping approach specifically designed for identifying genes associated with binary traits, such as diseases. Unlike existing methods, FABIO models all genes on an entire chromosome simultaneously to capture correlations between genes and improve the power of TWAS fine-mapping. This is achieved through a probit model that links genetically regulated expression (GReX) of genes to binary outcomes, taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes on a chromosome.

FABIO was evaluated through extensive simulations and applied to six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank dataset. The results showed that FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27.9-36.9% compared to existing approaches. FABIO also successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension.

FABIO's performance was compared to existing fine-mapping methods, FOCUS and FOGS, through simulations using real genotype data and simulated gene expression and binary outcome traits. The results showed that FABIO achieved substantial power gains over existing methods while effectively controlling false discoveries. FABIO's ability to model all genes on an entire chromosome allows it to capture GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually, potentially increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp42, play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when cells are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Normally, cells have quality control mechanisms to refold or degrade misfolded proteins. However, when these mechanisms fail, misfolded proteins can accumulate and cause cell dysfunction and toxicity. Btn2 and Hsp42 act as "sequestrases" to sequester misfolded proteins into specific sites within cells, preventing their accumulation and potential toxicity.

In the absence of Btn2 and Hsp42, cells become sensitive to oxidative stress and accumulate protein aggregates. The researchers found that these proteins are required to sequester oxidized proteins into defined protein quality control (PQC) sites following ROS exposure. They also identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and showed that Btn2 and Hsp42 suppress the formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35.

The study suggests that protein sequestration is a key antioxidant defense mechanism that helps mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. The researchers found that the absence of Btn2 and Hsp42 leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates, including both amorphous and amyloid forms, which is consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of protein sequestration in maintaining proteostasis and preventing protein misfolding diseases.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screen to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in glioblastoma (GBM) invasion. While previous studies have focused on coding genes, this study aimed to evaluate the role of lncRNAs in GBM invasion. The researchers used CRISPRi to knockdown 2,307 candidate lncRNAs and assess their association with invasion capacity in Matrigel. The top candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown in three tumor lines.

Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with a decrease in invasion upon knockdown, with the top candidate, LINC03045, showing an 82.7% decrease in tumor cell invasion. LINC03045 expression was also significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that WASF3, a gene previously implicated in tumor invasion, was highly correlated with LINC03045 expression. Knockdown of WASF3 was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and overexpression of WASF3 rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown.

The study identified LINC03045 as a critical lncRNA involved in GBM invasion, and its expression was significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. The results suggest that LINC03045 may regulate invasion via WASF3, providing a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment. This study highlights the importance of lncRNAs in GBM invasion and the potential of CRISPRi screening for identifying novel therapeutic targets.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli. They used electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants who listened to a sequence of sounds generated by a random process. The goal was to identify the type of model the brain uses to understand these sequences. A new clustering procedure was developed to analyze the EEG data and group similar patterns together. This approach allowed the researchers to identify the regularities in the sequence of sounds that the brain uses to build a model.

The study found that the brain uses the repeated occurrence of a strong beat in the sequence of sounds to build a model of the sequence. This suggests that the brain is able to identify patterns in the sequence and use them to make predictions about what comes next. The researchers used a context tree to generate the sequence of sounds, which is a mathematical model that describes the probability of each sound given the context of the previous sounds.

The study's findings provide evidence that the brain uses a specific type of model to process sequences of auditory stimuli, and that this model is based on the repeated occurrence of strong beats in the sequence. This has implications for our understanding of how the brain processes complex patterns and makes predictions about the world around us.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at the single-cell level. However, it has limitations when applied to highly heterogeneous solid tissues and organs, which require cell dissociation for analysis. This can lead to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq results using composite scRNA-seq data. To address this issue, researchers have developed a computational method to calculate cell type-specific weighting factors (cWFs), which account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression.

The cWFs were computed for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs and validated using five methods: reconstitution, deconvolution of whole-organ RNA-seq data, comparison to experimentally measured transcript contents, independence from differential cell-type ratios, and prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. The results show that cWFs accurately reconstitute and deconvolve whole-organ RNA-seq data and recapitulate experimentally-determined total mRNA content differences. Furthermore, cWFs were found to predict aging progression, suggesting their potential diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanisms. This study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues and organs, and highlights the diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) extends this approach to estimate the direct effects of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, both MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants, which violate one of the core assumptions of instrumental variables. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a radial formulation of MVMR, which allows for the visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are outlying based on their association with all exposures.

The radial MVMR approach includes an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which enables the visualisation of the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis. Additionally, radial MVMR includes an option for the removal of outlying SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A new R package, RMVMR, has been developed to implement the radial MVMR methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses, highlighting its ability to visualise causal effect estimates and provide valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. The radial MVMR approach is particularly useful for identifying SNPs that contribute to global heterogeneity with respect to each included exposure.
Researchers studied the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, also known as fruit flies, over a period of up to 7 days. They used high-speed cameras to record the flies' movements at 100 frames per second, capturing nearly 2 billion instances of the flies' postures. By analyzing this data, the researchers identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion. They found distinct daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed.

The study revealed that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, and that this time point tracks well with other indicators of health, such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spent moving versus resting. The researchers also found a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days.

The study provides a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms. The researchers used a deep learning framework called SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individual flies, allowing them to explore how the flies' behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. The study's high-resolution data also revealed differences in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily appearing in the grooming component of behavior.
Researchers have explored the role of protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type (PTPNs) in the adaptive immune system, but their functions beyond immunoregulation are not well understood. A study in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has identified a novel function for the conserved phosphatase PTPN-22 in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A genetic screen revealed that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, which regulate membrane trafficking and actin dynamics. Proximity labeling studies identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22, and loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed molting defects. PTPN-22 was found to be involved in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting a role in maintaining tissue structural integrity. Additionally, PTPN-22 was implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline. The study highlights the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions.
Researchers have developed a new tool to track the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, a major challenge to malaria elimination efforts. Artemisinin derivatives are the current gold standard treatment for malaria, but resistance to these drugs has been increasing in the region. A comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network was used to analyze the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) gene, which are associated with artemisinin resistance. A Bayesian geostatistical model was applied to the data to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance. The resulting maps show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022, with the most significant spatial change occurring between 2010 and 2015. This study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by predicting the spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at a subcontinent level. The maps can be used to support monitoring of drug resistance, target preventive strategies, and guide malaria elimination efforts. This is the first time such fine-scale predictive maps have been produced for artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. The study's findings are consistent with earlier modeling work and provide a valuable tool for health organizations to prioritize malaria control measures and prevent the further spread of resistance.
Researchers have studied the function-to-find domain (FIIND)-containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response through the inflammasome signaling pathway. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides. The researchers found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b (mNLRP1b) and the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 (rNLRP1) and CARD8 mediate these interactions. The study also explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 (DPP9) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complexes. However, DPP9 does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. The study provides new insights into the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation, highlighting the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.
Researchers have identified a protein called Rer1 as a key regulator of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is crucial for maintaining cellular fitness and overall tissue health. Defects in proteostasis can lead to proteotoxic stress, which can cause cells to become "losers" and be eliminated by their healthier neighbors through a process called cell competition.

The study found that Rer1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, and its loss leads to proteotoxic stress and activation of the PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This suggests that Rer1 plays a role in regulating ER proteostasis. The researchers also found that Rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells.

Interestingly, the study found that Rer1 levels are upregulated in cells that overexpress the Myc protein, which causes overgrowth. This suggests that Rer1 provides cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. The results demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of proteostasis and cell competition, and highlights the importance of Rer1 in maintaining cellular fitness and tissue health.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between mutations in the CHEK2 gene and an increased risk of breast and other cancers. The CHEK2 gene encodes a protein called CHK2, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene can result in 3,188 unique amino acid changes, but most of these changes have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHK2 protein. To address this knowledge gap, scientists used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of all but two of the 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. The results showed that 770 of the non-synonymous changes were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. These findings correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. This approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using yeast RAD53 complementation as a method for assessing the function of CHEK2 variants and provides a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers to better understand the relationship between CHEK2 mutations and cancer risk.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae regulates its epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. The pathogen forms multiple intra-populations with distinct epigenetic and phenotypic traits, such as colony opacity, due to invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. The researchers found that the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin (TA) system regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, thereby controlling the pathogen's epigenome and associated traits. The SpxA1-TenA system is a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, where the toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. When TenA is overexpressed, it binds to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX, which in turn enhances the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, favoring the formation of transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations. The researchers found that spontaneous variations in the number of AT dinucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon act as a programmed genetic switch, generating pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. The SpxA1-TenA system is controlled at the transcriptional level by the variable length of the AT-rich region upstream of the spxA1-tenA promoter. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic adaptation in S. pneumoniae and highlights the importance of the SpxA1-TenA system in regulating the pathogen's epigenome and associated traits.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare two high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can only analyze one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) was previously proposed to address this issue, but it requires a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned, resulting in multiple possible solutions with no clear correct answer. Additionally, cPCA treats the two conditions asymmetrically, making it difficult to compare them equally.

The new gcPCA method eliminates the need for a hyperparameter and allows for symmetric comparison of the two conditions. This is achieved by introducing a normalization factor that mitigates the bias towards high-variance dimensions. The gcPCA method is based on the covariance structure of the datasets and finds dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions.

gcPCA has been implemented in an open-source toolbox, available in Python and MATLAB, with several variants tailored for different scenarios. The method has been demonstrated to be useful in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, including neurophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Specifically, gcPCA was used to detect hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and to identify heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. The gcPCA method is fast, robust, and easy to use, making it a valuable resource for analyzing high-dimensional datasets and gaining new insights into complex biological phenomena.
Researchers have developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. BCR signaling is crucial for B cell survival and maturation, but its downstream pathways are not well understood. The model, based on systematically perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells, revealed feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. This crosstalk was verified in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites.

The trained network for BL-2 cells was found to be transferable to BL-41 cells, and it was also suitable for modeling BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling. This suggests that BCR aberration does not cause significant downstream rewiring. The model also discovered three novel connections that improved the model fit, including a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70, and a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK.

The researchers aimed to assess whether the final network describes BCR signaling in a general way and found that the BL-2-derived network structure forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in DLBCL cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling. The model's insights may apply to other B cell lymphomas, as the signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types.
Researchers have explored the Notch receptor signalling network, which plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance. Notch receptor activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular transactivation and intracellular cis inhibition. The study investigated the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Using a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, the researchers found that DLL4 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation, while JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. This heteromeric complex enables angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tip cells and trailing stalk cells. The study proposes a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The findings suggest that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes, which could underlie the observed opposing effects of JAG1 and DLL4 in sprouting angiogenesis. The study contributes to the understanding of Notch signalling and its role in angiogenic patterning, and highlights the importance of heteromeric complexes in regulating Notch receptor activity.
Researchers have developed a new method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc) to improve clustering in bioinformatics and other fields. Clustering is a technique used to group similar data points together, but it often ignores uncertainty or measurement error associated with the data. DPMUnc is an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that takes into account the uncertainty associated with each data point. The researchers tested DPMUnc on simulated data and found that it outperformed existing methods. They also applied DPMUnc to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using genetic data, which has uncertainty linked to the sample size of the study. DPMUnc successfully separated autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and identified other subgroups, such as adult-onset arthritis. Additionally, the researchers used DPMUnc to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. They developed a novel procedure to generate a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from the one where it was discovered, incorporating a measure of variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. This procedure was applied to three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. The results showed association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work lies in demonstrating the importance of using uncertainty to inform clustering and presenting a method that does this, as well as extending the use of gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined.
Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling the primate visual system, but they struggle to account for the importance of shape in human vision. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on shape to determine category membership, deep networks rely more on color and texture features. Researchers designed artificial image datasets to investigate why this is the case. They trained networks from scratch to classify images using single features and combinations of features, and found that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. This bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates during mini-batch gradient descent. The study suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are needed to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their ability to describe human vision. Convolutional neural networks, in particular, developed a bias towards color and texture features, even though they were able to learn shape-based classification. This bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning, specifically from the alignment of gradients for color and texture features with image classes. The researchers propose that changing the learning algorithm, rather than the network architecture, is necessary to enable deep networks to recognize shapes. They found that reducing the alignment between color- and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape-based classification.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the behavior of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic liver diseases. The model, based on the Kappa graph rewriting language, simulates the interactions between HSCs and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) molecules, which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, a key component of the extracellular matrix. The model reveals the critical role of HSC inactivation in fibrosis progression and reversion, and predicts the accumulation of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) during chronic liver disease. Simulation studies also show that reactivation loops of iHSCs are required to sustain fibrosis. The model's sensitivity to TGFβ1 parameters suggests its adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis validates the predicted ECM dynamics. Furthermore, analysis of RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis confirms the accumulation of iHSCs, identifying them as novel markers of fibrosis progression. This study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease, which can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis, and can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a new meta-analysis framework to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex human traits and diseases. This framework is particularly useful for large-scale genomic consortia, like the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies. The new method, called MEGA, requires only summary statistics and can account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic profiling platforms. In simulations, MEGA was found to be more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory results comparable to analyzing individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. The researchers applied MEGA to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The results showed that the proposed method can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies. The MEGA method is available in the R package MetaR2M on GitHub. This new framework can be used to identify potential mediators influencing health-related outcomes and has the potential to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method called PDRWH to identify personalized driver genes in cancer. Driver genes are mutations that contribute to tumor growth, while passenger mutations do not. Current methods often provide a single list of driver genes for a group of patients, ignoring individual differences. PDRWH prioritizes mutated genes based on their impact on downstream gene expression in patients with similar genetic profiles. The method was tested on 16 cancer datasets and outperformed existing methods in identifying known driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. PDRWH was also able to identify both common and rare drivers. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed individual-level and cohort-level methods. The personalized driver profiles generated by PDRWH can improve tumor stratification and provide new insights into tumor heterogeneity. One predicted novel driver gene, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), was validated in vitro, showing a promoting effect on tumor cell proliferation. The PDRWH method integrates genome and transcriptome analysis to identify candidate personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across cohort samples. It requires knowledge of cohort samples from a specific cancer type, including somatic mutation and gene expression profiles, as well as a gene interaction network. The method has the potential to assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy called the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP). The VEP combines personalized anatomical data with mathematical models of abnormal brain activity to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods. This allows for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. To improve the effectiveness of the VEP, the researchers used a global optimization approach called SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm that can perform parallel computation. This approach yielded high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. The researchers also used a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, which resulted in significant gains in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, they added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. The VEP has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, which can inform clinical decision-making. By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, the VEP offers a versatile platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid in clinical decision-making. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, showing better scalability and superior performance compared to other parallel solvers.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Researchers investigated the dynamics of Mtb growth in rabbit lungs using a novel, virulent clinical isolate, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid, pBP10. In vitro experiments showed that pBP10 was more stable in HN878 than in a commonly used laboratory-adapted strain, H37Rv. However, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in rabbit lungs did not follow a monotonic decline. Instead, the percentage of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection, despite a significant increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that this non-monotonic change could be explained by the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication and death kinetics. One sub-population expanded early and was controlled or eliminated, while another, smaller population expanded at later times, causing an increase in the percentage of plasmid-bearing cells. The study's findings highlight differences in Mtb dynamics between rabbits and mice, emphasizing that "rabbits are not mice." The results also suggest that individual granulomas in rabbit lungs may have independent bacterial dynamics. Future research will focus on correlating estimated replication and death rates with the magnitude of immune response components in individual granulomas.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool called GlycanTreeModeler to predict and design complex carbohydrate structures, known as glycans, that are attached to proteins. Glycans play a crucial role in various biological functions, but determining their structure is challenging due to their complexity. The GlycanTreeModeler algorithm builds glycans layer by layer, using data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations. The tool was tested on a set of glycan structures of varying lengths and showed high accuracy in predicting their native structures. The researchers also used GlycanTreeModeler to design glycans to shield regions of a protein nanoparticle vaccine from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified the shielding effect. This work has the potential to aid in glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination. The tool can also be used to analyze new protocols and results in the field of glycoprotein modeling. The GlycanTreeModeler algorithm and associated tools allow for accurate modeling of glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling, with a median root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.7 angstroms for glycans of varying length and complexity.
Researchers have identified a new ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, in the fungus Penicillium oxalicum. This pair plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality and gene expression. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF complex, which includes the F-box protein Fbx23, recognizes and targets the transcription factor Ace1 for degradation. However, in the absence of Fbx23, Ace1 accumulates and becomes dysfunctional, losing its ability to bind to target gene promoters. This leads to the upregulation of cellulase genes, which are responsible for breaking down cellulose, and the repression of genes involved in asexual development and spore pigmentation.

The study found that Fbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace1, allowing it to regulate gene transcription in response to different signals. In the presence of glucose, Fbx23 promotes the degradation of Ace1, leading to the repression of cellulase genes. In contrast, under cellulose signal, Fbx23's absence results in the accumulation of dysfunctional Ace1, leading to the upregulation of cellulase genes.

The researchers propose a model in which Fbx23 and Ace1 work together to regulate gene transcription in response to different signals. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in fungi and highlights the importance of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system in controlling protein quality and gene expression.
Researchers have identified the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of the basement membrane (BM), a crucial structural element in tissues that plays a key role in organ development. The BM is composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix, but the pathways involved in its formation and diversification have been poorly understood. A study in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium has shed light on the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. The study found that two parallel routes, defined by Rab10 and Rab8, are responsible for BM protein secretion. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, resulting in the formation of a homogenous matrix. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and Rab10 are present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins, and DAPC is essential for fibril formation. The exocyst complex has a dual function: it interacts with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization and is also required for the Rab8 route. The study suggests that the co-existence of parallel secretory routes, orchestrated by these Rab proteins, is the basic mechanism explaining BM diversification during development. The findings provide new insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrate that BM diversification can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The model, called the Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), uses a technique called multi-task learning (MTL) to improve predictions. MTL involves training the model on multiple antibodies at once, rather than one at a time. This approach has been shown to increase the model's performance and address two key challenges in HIV-1 research: underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance.

The LBUM was pre-trained on HIV-1 Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned with sequences that included both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. The model was compared to classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, and outperformed them in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 bnAbs. The researchers also demonstrated that MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and allow the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies. This information can be used to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bnAb combinations. The LBUM is publicly available and can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy. The study's findings have the potential to increase the therapeutic benefits of bnAbs and address key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research.
Researchers have developed new predictive models for multiple myeloma (MM), a type of blood cancer characterized by the abnormal growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Current treatments for MM vary in effectiveness between patients, highlighting the need for more accurate prognostic models to inform treatment decisions. Previous models have focused on gene expression data, but this approach has limitations, as the dysfunction of specific pathways is closely linked to disease development and progression.

To address this, the researchers explored two strategies that incorporate pathway information into predictive models: the pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The pathway score method converts gene expression data into sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting, while group lasso identifies the most relevant pathways associated with the disease. The researchers implemented these methods in microarray data from MM patients and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in internal validation.

The new model, which incorporates immune-related pathways, outperformed gene-based models and previously published models in both internal and external validation. The model was also more resistant to missing values, and a missing data imputation method was integrated to facilitate future validation. The results suggest that pathway-based models are competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM, providing a more stable and interpretable approach to predictive modeling. The new model has been documented in an R package, along with a missing data imputation method, to facilitate future research and validation.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. Mitochondrial fission is a critical process that occurs in response to cellular injury and is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. The model focuses on the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a protein that plays a key role in mitochondrial fission.

The model, called the Fission Model, is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. The researchers used the model to identify parameters that regulate the total fission rate (TFR), which is the rate at which mitochondria divide. They found that the TFR is strongly influenced by a single parameter, μ, which represents the maximum build rate of Drp1 oligomers over their disassembling rate.

The researchers discovered that the cumulative total fission (TF), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, does not increase monotonically with μ. Instead, it increases with μ to a certain point and then decreases as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting certain regulatory parameters, such as the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of these regulatory parameters may aid in the selection of future therapeutic targets.
Researchers have developed a novel CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. The system targets the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest, and Drosophila melanogaster, a model insect. To mitigate the development of resistance, the researchers used multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target functionally constrained regions of the Tdc2 gene. They found that feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, making it easier to maintain the gene drive system. The researchers also tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Their findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles and that the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. This study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. The researchers demonstrated the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct gene drive systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster.
Researchers have found that the brain's ability to learn and form memories is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required for synaptic plasticity, the process of changing the strength of connections between neurons. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks can be metabolically costly, and more complex tasks can require a significant amount of energy. To better understand how the brain learns efficiently, the researchers explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. They proposed two algorithms that restrict plasticity to save energy: one that only modifies synapses with large updates, and another that restricts plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. These algorithms were found to save energy while only slightly increasing learning time. The results suggest that competitively restricting plasticity can help reduce the metabolic energy associated with synaptic plasticity. This research may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a more efficient match between artificial and biological learning. Additionally, the algorithms could benefit hardware design, as electronic memory storage is also energetically costly.
Researchers investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects caused by genome streamlining in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx. They created six variants of the strain with deletions of 22- to 42-kilobase regions and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. The researchers then evolved replicate populations of these strains in chemically defined minimal medium or complex medium for approximately 300 generations and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates.

The results showed that fitness increased in all cases except for two ancestors that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, although the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment.

The study demonstrates that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution. This recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. The results suggest that laboratory evolution is a viable strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains and provide a path forward for engineering a minimal-genome A. baylyi strain.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism. The tool, called RiboFlip, uses a self-cleaving ribozyme to reduce mRNA levels of a target gene. The ribozyme, T3H48, was inserted into the second intron of the albino gene in zebrafish, resulting in a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. The researchers used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to insert the ribozyme and a base-editing strategy to inactivate it, demonstrating the specificity and reversibility of the approach. A Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, was also developed to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. Activation of RiboFlip induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Additionally, a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter was integrated into the RiboFlip cassette, allowing for the labeling of knocked-down cells independently of the target gene expression. The RiboFlip cassette is presented as a flexible tool for controlling endogenous gene expression in vertebrates, offering an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. This approach has the potential to expand the genetic toolbox available for functional genomics in vertebrates, particularly in the zebrafish model, which allows for efficient screening of genetic tools due to its external fertilization and rapid early development.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called aiSEGcell to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for transgenic or dye labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. aiSEGcell uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cellular structures in transmitted light images. The software is designed to be accessible to users with no prior coding experience and can be used with a command line or graphical user interface. It is also adaptable to new use cases and can be retrained with as few as 32 images. aiSEGcell has been extensively evaluated for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from various imaging modalities, including hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. The software accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, retaining biologically relevant information. This is particularly useful for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. The researchers provide a curated ground-truth data set with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images to support the development and evaluation of aiSEGcell. The software's generic image segmentation approach is not limited to bright field microscopy and can be applied to other imaging modalities.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to identify features that predict rewards in new environments. They asked 295 participants to learn the rewards associated with two-dimensional stimuli, where one feature predicted the reward and the other did not. The researchers manipulated the speed at which the features changed and found that participants learned faster when the reward-predictive feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly, compared to when the opposite was true. This suggests that humans have a bias towards learning from features that change slowly.

The study used a decision-making task where participants had to repeatedly learn which feature predicted the reward. The results showed that participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predictive feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly. After learning, participants could generalize the learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions.

The researchers used a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models to test how feature speed affected learning. The results showed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and speed of feature changes. The study found that the larger the improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates.

Overall, the study provides evidence that human reinforcement learning favors slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. The findings suggest that humans use a "slowness prior" to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning, which aids in learning task states in a reinforcement learning domain.
Researchers have identified a new gene, Resf1, as a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancer. This type of breast cancer has the worst prognosis and often leads to rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, the study found that reducing Resf1 expression in mice led to increased tumor growth, shorter overall survival time, and more lung metastases. These results are consistent with patient data showing that lower Resf1 expression is associated with worse outcomes.

Resf1 is a poorly characterized gene that produces a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. The study used CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed with the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model (MMTV-PyMT) to investigate the role of Resf1 in breast cancer. The results suggest that Resf1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss enhances tumor progression in ER-negative breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.

Mechanistic analysis revealed that Resf1 may play a role in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. The study provides evidence that Resf1 is a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER-negative breast cancer, and its loss may contribute to the aggressive behavior of this type of cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Resf1 in breast cancer and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
Researchers studied the roles of two proteins, Mec1 and Rad24, in meiotic recombination, a process that occurs during cell division in yeast. Meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair through a process called homologous recombination. Mec1 and Rad24 are part of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is activated in response to DSBs. The study used two approaches to examine the genome-wide roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination: deleting the mismatch repair protein Msh2 and controlling the length of meiotic prophase using the Ndt80 transcription factor. The results showed that loss of Rad24 led to severely impacted spore viability and reduced recombination frequency due to a shortened prophase. In contrast, loss of Mec1 function increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. However, both Rad24 and Mec1 loss led to an increase in complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. The study also found that Mec1 and Rad24 play important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers (COs), with loss of either protein leading to more random CO distributions. The results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, with Mec1 loss helping to suppress broader defects in CO regulation caused by DDR abrogation.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis jirovecii, a deadly fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. The model aims to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder the growth of this pathogen in vitro. Pneumocystis jirovecii is notoriously difficult to culture in a laboratory setting, limiting research efforts to understand its biology and develop effective treatments.

The model was created using recently published genome data and bioinformatics tools, and was validated through relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches. The researchers used the model to make predictions about metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. They also analyzed Merali's growth medium and suggested how to supplement it to enhance Pneumocystis growth.

The model has the potential to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing Pneumocystis in vitro. It can replicate drop-off and gene knockout experiments, making it a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets. Additionally, the model can provide insights into the biology of Pneumocystis, including its composition, physiological and biological characteristics, kinetics of nutrient uptake, and enzymatic activities.

The researchers also developed a genome-scale metabolic model for the mouse-specific fungal pathogen, Pneumocystis murina, which can be used as a control to compare the growth of Pneumocystis in vitro with its growth in vivo in the host. Overall, the model offers a novel strategy to overcome the major bottleneck in Pneumocystis research and advance our understanding of this deadly pathogen.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) in cell proliferation. At low cell density, YAP/TAZ promotes cell growth by localizing to the nucleus. However, at high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated, leading to YAP/TAZ translocation to the cytoplasm and cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells have higher levels of YAP/TAZ than normal cells, but it is unclear if this increase alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition at high density.

To address this question, a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model was developed to simulate cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. The model includes a novel component that inputs cell density, reflecting cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway. Simulations were performed at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density.

Results showed that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. This model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress abnormal cancer cell proliferation, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The model's integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of cell density and YAP/TAZ concentration on proliferation.
Researchers have discovered that low-complexity domains (LCDs) in eukaryotic proteins and RNAs have a tendency to form phase-separated biomolecular condensates. These condensates can transition to solid-like states when their dynamics are disrupted by mutations. To understand how the molecular sequence of LCDs influences condensate behavior, scientists have developed an energy landscape framework. This framework uses a continuous "stickiness" scale to analyze the effects of LCD sequence patterns on condensate dynamics and material properties.

The framework, called the Free Energy Landscape of Stickers (FELaS), reveals that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. The researchers found that maintaining fluidity in condensates requires a minimum level of periodicity in LCD patterns, preventing transitions to glassy or solid-like states. The energy landscape framework also explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic changes in condensate viscoelasticity based on variations in sticker periodicity and strength.

Using FELaS, scientists can dissect how the complexity of LCD patterns affects the dynamics and material properties of resulting condensates. The framework provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, advancing our understanding of their dynamics and functional roles. The study addresses a critical gap in the field by elucidating the role of sequence complexity in governing the behavior of phase-separating biomolecules.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that drives the formation of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, during embryonic development. The process begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme. Signaling molecules, including Shh, play a crucial role in this process, but how they lead to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes was not well understood. Using the mouse dentition as a model, scientists found that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination. They discovered that myosin II promotes cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer of the tooth bud. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation through the AKT pathway. The researchers also found that pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh signaling. These findings support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. The study highlights the importance of myosin II in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium, which is critical for the proper formation of teeth. The results also suggest that the Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis plays a key role in promoting cell-cell adhesion and cell movement during tooth development.
Researchers have developed a new method called scTGCN, a deep transfer model based on graph convolutional networks, to integrate and analyze large-scale single-cell multiomics data. This method enables the transfer of labels from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological mechanisms. The current label transfer methods have limitations in preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets.

The scTGCN model addresses these challenges by formulating and aggregating cell-cell relationships and gene expression using graph convolutional networks, which are based on the kinetic relationships between the specific regulatory mechanisms of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. The model uses a multistage transfer learning strategy to efficiently integrate gene expression and chromatin accessibility data into a unified multi-omics mouse cell atlas. The scTGCN method is versatile and can effectively combine different types of measurements, even if the data is unpaired.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of scTGCN in transferring cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. The scTGCN model achieved high label transfer accuracy and effectively transferred knowledge across different modalities. This method has the potential to empower the exploration of single-cell omics data and provide new insights into complex biological mechanisms.
Researchers have characterized the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, to understand how it is directed into the cell nucleus. The NLS is a short motif rich in basic amino acids, but identifying it can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) modeling, the study found that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth.

The study identified specific basic residues within Mcm3's NLS that are critical for its function, including positions 2 and 3, which interact with importin alpha. Mutations at these positions result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth. The researchers also used AF3 to model the interaction between importin alpha and Mcm3's NLS variants, demonstrating that the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen share similar contacts with Kap60.

The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. Further characterization of Mcm3's NLS will help elucidate its cell cycle-dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, and refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins.
Ataxin-2, a protein encoded by the ATXN2 gene, plays a crucial role in various neurodegenerative diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type II, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinsonism. Research has shown that Ataxin-2 functions in translational activation, repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm domain of Ataxin-2, which stimulates mRNA translation, has been found to antagonize mRNP-granule assembly.

Recent studies have identified a polyA-binding protein (PABP) interacting PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 as a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments using Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins revealed that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both contribute to Ataxin-2-induced cytotoxicity. The data suggest that Ataxin-2 interactions are remodeled during translational control, with structured and non-structured interactions playing different roles in the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.

Ataxin-2 has three conserved regions: a Like-Sm (LSm) domain, an LSm-associated domain (LSm-AD), and a PAM2 motif, which is flanked by extended IDRs. The PAM2 motif and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit Ataxin-2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Ataxin-2 function and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers studied the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different parts of the body, specifically in the extraocular muscles (EOMs) and limb muscles. They found that the gene Pitx2 plays a crucial role in the early development of muscle stem cells in EOMs, but becomes less important as the cells mature. In contrast, the gene Pax7 is essential for the maintenance of muscle stem cells in both EOMs and limb muscles. The researchers also discovered that muscle stem cells in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not proliferate in the adult. However, EOMs have a higher number of muscle stem cells per area compared to limb muscles. In a model of muscular dystrophy, the researchers found that muscle stem cells in EOMs were less proliferative and fewer in number compared to controls. This study provides new insights into the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different parts of the body and sheds light on the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy. The findings suggest a relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance and highlight the heterogeneity of muscle stem cells along the body axis.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called VOCs-INN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. This algorithm combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. The VOCs-INN algorithm emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting.

The algorithm was tested using reported data from the British Columbia province in Canada and its five internal health agencies. The results showed that VOCs-INN can accurately fit the reported data and simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The algorithm also performed well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

The researchers note that SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune evasion capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments. To evaluate the risk of these variants, simulating the transmission mechanism within the population and determining the time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial. The VOCs-INN algorithm leverages available observational data and the underlying physical principles governing infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters.

The integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with infectious disease models, particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach, represents a significant research contribution. The VOCs-INN method can accurately fit data and infer complex time-varying parameters by encoding real VOCs infection data, epidemiological transmission mechanisms, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into neural networks.
Researchers have developed a new approach called CytoSummaryNet to improve the analysis of cell populations in biomedical research. Traditional methods of analyzing cell populations involve averaging the features of individual cells, but this approach fails to capture the diversity within the population. CytoSummaryNet uses a technique called self-supervised contrastive learning to identify the optimal way to aggregate single-cell feature data. This method brings together data points from the same sample and pushes apart data points from different samples in a feature space. By doing so, it captures generalizable features that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. The researchers applied this approach to a public dataset and found that CytoSummaryNet improved mechanism of action prediction by 30-68% compared to traditional averaging methods. This improvement is attributed to the model's ability to downweight small or noisy cells and prioritize larger, uncrowded cells. CytoSummaryNet requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in most cell profiling datasets. The approach offers a straightforward post-processing step that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. The researchers suggest that CytoSummaryNet can be applied to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics. Overall, CytoSummaryNet provides an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies.
Researchers have developed a new framework to measure cognitive effort in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The framework identifies discrete patterns of brain activity, known as EEG microstates, and uses optimal transport theory to quantify the effort involved in transitioning between these states. This approach was applied to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect. The results showed a correlation between the cost of transitioning between brain states and the level of cognitive demand during the task. This is the first time this framework has been applied to EEG data, providing a new method for quantifying cognitive demand in EEG experiments. The study's findings highlight the importance of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes and offer insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance. By using a fully data-driven method, this research opens up new perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aMBCs) in the immune response to Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria. They found that individuals exposed to P. vivax developed aMBCs, which persisted even after recovery from the infection. To understand the function of these cells, the researchers generated probes to detect P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPII)-specific aMBCs and tested their ability to produce neutralizing antibodies. They isolated single aMBCs and found that some produced antibodies with high levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG, comparable to classical MBC clones. Two clones, A1F12 and B4E11, produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. The researchers also found that the B cell receptors of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, similar to classical MBCs. These findings suggest that P. vivax infections elicit the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs, which may play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. The study highlights the potential of aMBCs in the humoral immune response to malaria and may facilitate the development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines. The researchers also demonstrated that aMBCs can differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes.
Researchers have developed a new method called mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model, to improve polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes. Unlike mr. mash, which requires individual-level data, mr. mash-rss uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. This allows mr. mash-rss to be applied to data sets that are not publicly available and makes it scalable to large biobank data sets. Through simulations, the researchers showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with and often outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction. The method's performance was evaluated in various scenarios, including different patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of causal variants, and genomic heritability. In a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, mr. mash-rss achieved higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set had a smaller sample size. The researchers also demonstrated that mr. mash-rss is robust to a small to medium amount of missing phenotypes and can be efficiently fitted in specific cases with complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes. Overall, mr. mash-rss addresses the limitations of mr. mash, including the need for individual-level data and lack of scalability to large data sets, making it a valuable tool for polygenic prediction in human genetics.
Researchers have developed a new modeling framework to improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions by incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into traditional homogeneous models. The framework, called the Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model, uses a neural network to approximate the recruitment rate of susceptible individuals during an outbreak. This approach allows for more accurate predictions of epidemic trends, including peak size, final size, herd immunity, and outbreak duration.

The UDE model was tested using data from the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, China, and compared to a traditional homogeneous model. The results showed that the UDE model provided an 18.6% improvement in prediction accuracy, with an attack rate of 80.06% and a peak of new infections of 3.17% of the population. In contrast, the homogeneous model predicted an attack rate of 99.97% and a peak of new infections of 32.78% of the population.

The study also found that incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the model decreased herd immunity for approximately 37.36% of the population and prolonged the outbreak period from 30 days to 70 days. These results align with real-world data and demonstrate the potential of the UDE model to improve epidemic predictions. The researchers believe that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models that can better capture the complexities of real-world epidemics.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which is surprising given the high energy cost of synapses. A new mathematical framework proposes that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. According to this framework, synapses interact with the postsynaptic neuron in a way that is similar to an agent navigating an uncertain environment. The framework suggests that synapses use an internal model of the postsynaptic neuron's membrane dynamics, which is updated by a synaptic learning rule similar to established mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). This approach implies that synapses use their noisy synaptic release to encode their uncertainty about the postsynaptic neuron's state. The researchers show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a network can resolve learning problems such as pattern classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments. By coordinating themselves, synapses can represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level, even in behaviorally ambiguous situations. This framework makes precise predictions about the interplay of synaptic and neural dynamics, including synaptic plasticity changes in response to post-pre-post spike pairing protocols. The researchers apply this framework to individual synapses, deriving a synaptic learning rule that enables synapses to adapt their efficacy to predict future postsynaptic spikes. They also show that the variability in synaptic release can be used to reflect uncertainty in neural firing, allowing the postsynaptic neuron to learn to fire according to Gaussian distributions of firing times.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scuphr for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is designed to overcome challenges associated with single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scuphr uses a distance-based approach and the neighbor-joining algorithm to compute the distance between cell pairs and reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is particularly useful for analyzing healthy tissues, where mutations are scarce, and more sophisticated models are needed to accurately reconstruct cell lineage trees. Single-cell DNA sequencing data, which reveals more point mutations than other data types, is essential for this analysis. However, this data comes with its own set of challenges, including distinguishing somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification. Scuphr addresses these challenges by incorporating them into its analysis. The method is also designed to be computationally efficient, with an embarrassingly parallel design that allows for faster analysis than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining better accuracy. The robustness of Scuphr was tested using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology. The results show that Scuphr can accurately reconstruct cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data, making it a valuable tool for studying development, differentiation, and cancer progression.
Researchers have proposed a new tool, the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model, to evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in low-income settings, such as Malawi. HBPs aim to determine which healthcare services should be included in the public healthcare system to improve population health outcomes. Traditional methods used to weigh evidence for different interventions have limitations. The TLO model addresses these limitations by simulating the incidence of disease, health-seeking behavior, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health.

Using extensive country-specific data, the researchers simulated the health gains achievable under various plausible HBP strategies for Malawi. They found that a linear constrained optimization analysis (LCOA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain, reducing disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by approximately 8% between 2023 and 2042. However, this approach incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of implementation.

The researchers also assessed alternative prioritization approaches, including service prioritization based on patient characteristics rather than service type. This approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period. The study suggests that prioritizing services based on patient characteristics may be beneficial in the future. The TLO model provides a unique tool for evaluating HBPs in low-income settings, allowing for detailed evaluations of health gains under realistic constraints on human resources for health.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of meiotic chromosomal events in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compared their findings to those in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori. They used Oligopaint DNA FISH to visualize single chromosomes at sub-chromosomal resolution and found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. This finding suggests that this mechanism may be conserved in Lepidopteran insects.

The study revealed that both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. The researchers also found that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. This challenges the classical view of segregation, where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I.

The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology. The findings suggest that moths employ a novel "center-kinetic" segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome. This mechanism is distinct from the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in other organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans.
Researchers have identified the median eminence (ME), located at the base of the hypothalamus, as a crucial hub for information exchange between the brain and pituitary gland. A previous study found that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, a condition characterized by underproduction of hormones. This study aimed to investigate the role of SOX3 in the hypothalamus and the development of hypopituitarism.

The results show that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME, leading to phenotypes that appear in juvenile animals. In the pituitary gland, hormone levels are reduced due to a lack of endocrine cell maturation. Additionally, the study found that ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected.

Interestingly, low-dose aspirin treatment and changes in gut microbiota were found to rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. This suggests that NG2-glia in the ME play a crucial role in supporting pituitary cell maturation, particularly during the post-weaning period. The study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation.

The researchers propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning. The study also demonstrates that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors, such as aspirin treatment or changes in gut microbiota.
Researchers investigated the role of the proteins CED-5/CED-12 in the development of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that CED-5/CED-12 is essential for embryonic epidermal cell migrations, and its loss leads to embryonic death due to failed cell migrations. However, surprisingly, CED-5/CED-12 inhibits F-actin formation in the migrating epidermis, which contradicts its expected role as a GEF (Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor) that activates the GTPase CED-10/Rac1. To resolve this paradox, the researchers investigated whether CED-12 has GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) functions. They identified a candidate GAP region in CED-12 and found that mutating it altered the epidermal cell migration function but not the corpse engulfment function. Further studies revealed that CED-5/CED-12 likely supports the cycling of multiple GTPases, using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. The researchers propose that CED-5/CED-12 acts as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during corpse engulfment, but its GAP function inhibits F-actin formation during embryonic epidermal cell migration. This study highlights the complex and multifaceted role of CED-5/CED-12 in regulating F-actin dynamics during embryonic morphogenesis.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across different timescales, particularly in the rodent visual system. They used a combination of information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to examine the relationship between information and correlation timescales in the mouse visual cortex. The study found that both information and correlation timescales increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

The researchers tested whether the observed increase in timescales is gradual or parallel, and found that a model with a gradual increase had more predictive power for both correlation and information timescales. This suggests a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual cortex. The study also explored alternative hypotheses, including the idea that stronger recurrence enables longer integration of visual information, and found that an increase in recurrent coupling can lead to a reduction of temporal correlations from external stimuli.

The results indicate that network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as an increase in recurrent coupling, play a significant role in shaping the temporal processing hierarchy. The study suggests that the rodent visual system uses intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.
Researchers used a non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study the neural circuits involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. They used recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. This model allowed them to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves.

The study found that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves, with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons playing a role. The researchers identified specific neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves and found that the total conduction delay of the shortest path to layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) determined the latency of the corticospinal wave.

The study also found that activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves. This suggests that the cortical origins of afferents may give rise to certain I-waves. The researchers used machine learning to identify common circuit features among these pathways and found that the most important feature to identify which corticospinal wave a preferential parameter affected was the conduction delay of the shortest path between the starting neuron and the L5 PTNs.

The study's methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure. This can help identify and understand the mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. The findings provide new insights into the neural circuits involved in the response to TMS and have implications for the development of new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in the maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, making it a valuable tool for research and clinical applications. CfpDNA is shed into the maternal bloodstream as early as the fourth week of gestation and can comprise up to 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities, including chromosomal aneuploidies such as Trisomies 13, 18, and 21.

CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta. However, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. Studying cfpDNA can improve our understanding of placental physiological processes, the functional role of cfpDNA in pregnancy, and how it can be used to study and monitor placental health and disease.

The distinction between cell-free "fetal" DNA and cell-free "placental" DNA is crucial, especially when discussing clinical applications of cfpDNA. CfpDNA has the potential to be a powerful research tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, which are currently hindered by ethical constraints and limited availability of early- and mid-gestation tissue samples. This can open avenues for many more clinical applications of cfpDNA beyond the current NIPT repertoire, which is limited to genetic screening of the fetus.
Researchers have identified a common genetic basis for hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, which account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs. While most GWAS variants are scattered across the genome, several genomic regions harbor variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting that common target genes may drive these associations.

The study found 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, with two regions containing risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs, and 28 for two HDCs. By integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, the researchers identified 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles.

The study also pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factor motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDCs. This research provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility.
Researchers have identified a genetic link to polymyositis, a muscle disease, in the Kooiker dog breed. A genome-wide association study found that a region on chromosome CFA19 was associated with the disease. Further analysis revealed a 39-kilobase deletion located 10 kilobases upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. This deletion was found in 81% of affected dogs and 25% of a random sample of Kooiker dogs. Leukocytes from affected dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 when stimulated with mitogens. The study suggests that elements located upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play a crucial role in regulating the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated to be 10-20% for homozygous dogs and 0.5-2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. The study also found that distant variants upstream of IL21 may be important for human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. A PCR assay was developed to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs, providing a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high-risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.
Researchers have developed a protein language model called ESMtherm to predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying pathogenic mutations. The model is trained on a large dataset of 528,000 natural and synthetic protein sequences derived from 461 protein domains, allowing it to accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. The study demonstrates that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability, and ESMtherm performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. However, its performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind state-of-the-art methods.

The researchers also found that training the model on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than a single domain, improves its performance for folding stability prediction. Additionally, the study highlights the benefits of training on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. While ESMtherm's performance on larger protein sequences is limited, the researchers suggest that a folding stability dataset of larger proteins could improve the model's generalizability. The study demonstrates the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden in protein stability prediction, and the results show that ESMtherm performs comparably to state-of-the-art models on small protein sequences.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) in autoimmunity, specifically in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). iKIRs are a family of receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells that regulate T cell-mediated immunity. The study aimed to determine if iKIRs affect the T cell response in T1D, a condition where an enhanced T cell response can be detrimental. The researchers conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a dataset of 11,961 individuals with T1D and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. This suggests that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. The study's findings were validated in an independent dataset. The results indicate that iKIRs decrease HLA class II protective associations, which is opposite to their effect in chronic viral infections where they enhance protective HLA associations. This study provides new insights into the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity and suggests that they may play a significant role in regulating CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. The findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions between the immune system and autoimmunity.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. FECD is characterized by the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element, CTG18.1, within the TCF4 gene. This expansion is responsible for up to 80% of European FECD cases. However, the non-coding nature of the repeat and the complexity of the TCF4 gene have made it challenging to study the disease.

Using a large cohort of primary corneal endothelial cells from individuals with and without CTG18.1 expansions, researchers employed advanced transcriptomic techniques to investigate the molecular components of FECD. The study revealed that CTG18.1 expansions lead to altered splicing and unique transcripts associated with the disease. Additionally, the researchers found that TCF4 isoform dysregulation is a key feature of FECD, particularly in individuals with CTG18.1 expansions.

The study also identified rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in individuals without CTG18.1 expansions, suggesting that TCF4 dysregulation may be a risk factor for FECD independent of the CTG18.1 expansion. These findings support the hypothesis that two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, contribute to the pathophysiology of FECD. The study's results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of FECD and may inform the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LTG) in rice, a trait essential for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) called qLTG11 in the Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra, which exhibits rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. Using QTL-seq, the researchers narrowed down the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) gene. They found that the Arroz da Terra allele of GF14h encodes a functional protein, whereas the Japanese rice variety Hitomebore has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region.

Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, while overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost during modern breeding. The researchers generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra, including GF14h, which showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers investigated the structure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and its role in the formation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a persistent form of the virus genome. They created a mutant HBV cell line with a specific mutation in the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) coding sequence, altering the sequence of the 3' terminal redundancy (TR) of the negative strand DNA. The study found that the 5' TR of the negative strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand DNA, while the 3' TR forms a flap-like structure that is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the positive strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type nucleotide at position 1822, indicating that the 5' TR is used as the template. The study also found that the 3' flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5' flap endonuclease FEN1. The researchers mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA and found that the overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5' and 3' flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursors. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the HBV replication cycle.
Researchers investigated the impact of industrial operations on microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. They developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities under varying organic loading rates (OLRs). The model included three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB).

The study found that as OLRs increased, the community shifted from SOB-dominant to MET-dominant, accompanied by a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs and adaptation to high OLRs. Simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under high OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. The model also showed that more cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance.

The researchers used the mmGEM to investigate how changes in metabolic capacities of key microbial groups and organic substrate availability influence microbial interactions and community dynamics within MFCs. They found that varying the maximum acetate consumption capacity of SOB and the maximum sulfide release capacity of SRB significantly impacted microbial community structure and MFC performance. The study highlights the significant role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial composition and MFC performance under varying OLRs. The findings will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. However, ML models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives when applied to unseen situations. To address this issue, a new framework called CPEC has been proposed to quantify the model's prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction, which provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. In a case study using enzyme function annotation, CPEC achieved reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. The CPEC framework is expected to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. By providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions, CPEC can help researchers make more efficient and reliable discoveries in biomedicine.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Hsp90 chaperone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 protein in neurons. Mutations in the TARDBP gene, which codes for TDP-43, can cause familial inherited ALS, suggesting that TDP-43 dysfunction drives the disease. The study used a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of ALS to explore the relationship between Hsp90 and TDP-43. The researchers found that disrupting Hsp90 function, either genetically or with small molecule inhibitors, protected against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection was accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein levels. The study also showed that Hsp90 mutation or inhibition upregulated key stress-responsive heat shock pathway genes, including hsp-70 and hsp-16.1, and that normal levels of hsp-16.1 were required for Hsp90 mutation effects on TDP-43. Furthermore, the researchers found that the neuroprotective effect of Hsp90 dysfunction did not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. These findings demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of the adult female reproductive system of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, using a technique called single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This approach allowed them to identify the different cell types present in the ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells, and compare them to a similar map of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary. The study found that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved between the two species, despite being separated by over 500 million years of evolution.

The researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. They identified clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns and found that they share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters. This suggests that the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the ovary are highly conserved across species.

The study also explored the unique regulatory programs and chromatin accessibility in the different cell types of the Artemia ovary. Additionally, the researchers investigated the gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. This work provides new insights into the biology of the female reproductive system and highlights the potential of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a tool for studying meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate or identify meiotic cells.
Chronic pain, specifically allodynia, is a widespread condition characterized by painful responses to non-painful stimuli, costing the US around $600 billion in 2010. Researchers have hypothesized that allodynia is caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A study analyzed biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, which are thought to mediate static and dynamic allodynia. The researchers used neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, they specified model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. A sensitivity analysis approach was used to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit's E-I signaling. The results suggest that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory neuron responses. The specific mechanisms, subcircuit components involved, and proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These findings provide specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be responsible for allodynia, offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in regulating the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a crucial protein involved in protein synthesis. They found that Hsp90 and its cochaperones, Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7, have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Mutations in Hsp90 or cochaperones affected the steady-state levels of eEF2, leading to reduced growth in yeast cells. Furthermore, mutations in eEF2 that mimic human disease-associated mutations were negatively impacted by the loss of Hgh1, a cochaperone that bridges the interaction between eEF2 and Hsp90 or the TRiC chaperone. The study also found that yeast cells expressing certain Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dependent on a unique post-translational modification on eEF2. These results suggest that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. The study provides further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones, and that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions in social situations when their individual preferences about risk are disrupted or inaccessible. They studied individuals with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas of the brain involved in risky decision-making. Participants played a gambling task where they made choices alone and after observing others' choices. The results showed that individuals with lesions in these brain areas had difficulty using standard calculations to evaluate risky options. However, when making decisions in social contexts, they relied more heavily on following the choices of others. This suggests that, in social situations, people may use a simpler "follow others" strategy when they are unable to make decisions based on their individual preferences about risk. The study found a correlation between the degree of disruption in utility-based decision-making and the use of this "follow others" heuristic. The more disrupted an individual's utility-based decision-making was, the more they conformed to the choices of others. This relationship was also observed in a separate group of control participants, providing further evidence for the idea that there is a trade-off between using complex calculations and simpler heuristics when making decisions about risk in social contexts.
Researchers have used biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating biological order from random mutations. However, a new study shows that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. The study found that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes are many orders of magnitude more likely to appear through random mutations. This bias favors simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. An information-theoretic principle formalizes this bias, which can be understood as evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms.

Using population genetics simulations, the researchers demonstrated that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, along with other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome can explain these patterns. The study suggests that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns observed in biomorphs may hold more widely for developmental systems.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, which cannot be predicted analytically. A numerical mode tool was used to compute nonlinear normal modes (NNM) of energy-conservative systems. In a user study, participants controlled a virtual double pendulum with joint compliance through a haptic joystick, aiming to hit two targets. The targets were either aligned with the NNM (Experiments 1 and 2) or offset (Experiment 3). Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite the resonance and stabilize an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. This was observed in all experiment variations, including increased task accuracy and targets located away from the NNM. Participants adjusted their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics and align the resonant motions with the task. The study provides data-based evidence that humans can apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. The findings extend existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems and suggest that humans can intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically.
In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. Two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, were found to negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin. Genetic analysis revealed that all three transcription factors are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. The expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under the control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR, and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Biochemical analysis showed that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating tight regulation of pulcherrimin production. The results suggest that PchR and AbrB act as roadblocks to RNA polymerase progression at the yvmC promoter, while ScoC has a weak direct regulatory role and may also have indirect regulation through another factor. The presence of the three repressors is necessary to limit the production of pulcherrimin, providing insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in bacteria.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect bladder function and how transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. The model replicates the loss of coordinated neural control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure, and the urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control bladder emptying. This loss of control leads to either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. The model also shows that TMS applied to the spinal cord after SCI can reduce DSD and incontinence.

The researchers created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, which replicated normal bladder function. They then added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI. The model was able to replicate the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI and the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity observed with TMS.

The study found that low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. The model suggests that neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and that both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms of TMS in reducing bladder dysfunction after SCI.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, from indirect optical density (OD600) data. Current methods for quantifying fungal growth rely on time-course morphology-specific data, but collecting such data is often impractical for clinical microbiology laboratories. The new model accounts for the indirect nature of OD600 measurements by explicitly including the relationship between OD600 and true fungal growth. This approach eliminates the need for calibration data, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data.

The model was tested using time-course OD600 data for A. fumigatus and compared to reference models that did not include calibration. The results showed that the new model outperformed the reference models in fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves. Additionally, the estimated morphology-specific growth rates from the new model were more accurate than those obtained from directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration.

The model treats OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration. This approach allows for the estimation of biologically interpretable and morphology-specific fungal growth rates from indirect OD600 data. The model's ability to accurately estimate growth rates without requiring calibration data makes it a valuable tool for clinical microbiology laboratories.
Beetles, the most species-rich group of animals, have diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, but some groups exhibiting X0 sex determination mechanisms. Researchers generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and analyzed eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. The study identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, but independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes have occurred, leading to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes exhibit stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. The study suggests that beetles provide a novel model to understand the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. A broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles reveals that they will be a promising model to study patterns of karyotype evolution and evolutionary forces operating on sex chromosomes. The researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera, generating a new chromosome-level assembly for Tribolium confusum and analyzing published assemblies from eleven additional species. The study highlights the importance of comparative analysis to address the prevalence of these patterns and the evolutionary forces driving them across species.
Researchers investigated the role of H2A.Z, a histone variant, in gene expression regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2A.Z is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR1-complex (SWR1-C) and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, previous studies on H2A.Z's role in gene expression have been confounded by the deleterious activity of apo-SWR1-C, the SWR1-C complex without its H2A.Z substrate. To address this, the researchers examined the mRNA transcript profiles of wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), which induces DNA replication stress. The results showed that H2A.Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for the proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. The study also found that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H2A.Z incorporation before and after HU treatment revealed that decreases in H2A.Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory effects of H2A.Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to DNA replication stress.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. However, classifying transcriptomic profiles into cell types and identifying lineage relationships is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the difficulty of obtaining fully annotated datasets. To address this challenge, researchers propose using partial label learning, a framework that assumes a set of candidate labels for each data point, rather than a single correct label. This approach is more feasible than traditional supervised learning methods, which require fully annotated datasets.

The authors extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, and logistic regression, to the partial label learning framework. They also study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods, particularly the hierarchical structure observed in developmental processes. The results show that these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method.

The authors demonstrate that the performance of their methods trained with partially annotated data reaches the same level as fully supervised data. They also study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on its effect on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. The findings show that hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, relying on a less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods.
Researchers have found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) plays a crucial role in the formation of nuclear compartments such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. PIP2 is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription and its localization in the nucleus is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. To investigate the relationship between PIP2 and RNA, the researchers identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated (RDPA) nuclear proteome in human cells using mass spectrometry. They found that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins, which are enriched for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The researchers also discovered that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. The study suggests that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins, affecting their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This implies a pivotal role of PIP2 in establishing a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.
Researchers have investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, a species-rich group of insects known for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development. The study focused on the development and evolution of cephalic horns, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation. By comparing chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species, the researchers identified evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. They also contrasted chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition males and females and identified distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development. The study highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits and demonstrates that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. The research provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. The study also sheds light on the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation in dung beetles. The findings suggest that non-synonymous substitutions in developmental regulatory genes may play adaptive roles in these species' development, and that chromatin architecture plays a crucial role in regulating conditional responses in trait formation.
Researchers used a monkey model to study the progression of Lassa fever, a viral disease that can cause severe illness and death. The study aimed to understand why some people recover from Lassa fever while others die from it. The researchers infected cynomolgus monkeys with two different strains of the Lassa virus and observed the progression of the disease. They found that the virus initially replicates in lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, in all infected animals, regardless of the severity of the disease. However, the virus's spread to other parts of the body and the immune response differ significantly between animals that recover and those that die. In animals that die from Lassa fever, the virus spreads to almost all organs and triggers an excessive inflammatory response, characterized by the infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. In contrast, in animals that recover, the virus's spread is limited to a few organs and is accompanied by a more controlled immune response. The study's findings provide new insights into the early dynamics of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with the different outcomes of the disease. This research is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and developing effective treatments for the disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTD/FTLD), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). They found that disruptions in NCT, including the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are present in both animal models and human diseases. However, it was unclear whether these alterations were a primary cause or a downstream consequence of the disease. To address this question, the researchers created two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration (NemfR86S and NemfR487G) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. They found that these models exhibit an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block, leading to the cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. The researchers also identified similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, they showed that transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in their mouse models and in neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin-β nuclear import.
Researchers have explored the potential of lytic bacteriophages in medical and biotechnological applications, but understanding their infection mechanisms is crucial. To study these mechanisms, scientists use CRISPR-Cas systems for site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications, such as cytosine glycosylation, which hinders mutagenesis efficiency. To overcome this challenge, a study utilized the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, as demonstrated by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. By temporally removing DNA modifications, the study elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. The results present a strategy for investigating phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. This approach is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants. The study applied NgTET to reduce 5-methylcytosine within the phage T4 genome, enabling the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas. This resulted in the facilitated introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner, exemplified by deactivating two specific T4 phage ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. The study also demonstrated that DNA modifications protect the genome of phage T4 from nucleolytic cleavage by Cas12, enabling efficient phage lysis.
Researchers have identified a new player in the process of repairing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. The study, conducted in yeast cells, found that a histone variant called H2A.Z is essential for efficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin, and H2A.Z is a specific type of histone that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and DNA repair.

When UV light damages DNA, it creates bulky lesions that can block transcription and replication. To repair these lesions, cells use a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). However, in the absence of H2A.Z, TC-NER is severely impaired, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA. DSBs are a major threat to genome stability and can lead to genetic mutations and cancer.

The study used a genetic screen to identify H2A.Z as a key component of TC-NER. The researchers found that H2A.Z is required for efficient TC-NER and for the clearance of RNA polymerase II, an enzyme that transcribes DNA into RNA. Without H2A.Z, cells are unable to properly repair UV-induced DNA damage, leading to an accumulation of DSBs.

The findings of this study highlight the importance of a DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability. The discovery of H2A.Z's role in TC-NER provides new insights into the mechanisms of DNA repair and has implications for understanding how cells respond to DNA damage.
Researchers analyzed gene expression and microbiome composition in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. They found extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects on gene expression, with tissue-specific effects being stronger than genetic background-specific effects. The two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than in genes with conserved expression. However, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. This observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence. The study also found that the genetic basis of expression variation and the mode of expression inheritance were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific. The results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, and the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the timing of the emergence of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19, by analyzing early reported cases. This approach uses a population dynamics model to simulate the spread of the disease and estimate the delay between the first infection and the detection of the Nth case. The method was validated using simulated data and then applied to two real-world examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019.

The study found that the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan likely occurred on November 28, 2019, with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 2019. This estimate is consistent with previous studies that used genomic data. The researchers also estimated the delay between the first infection and the detection of the Nth symptomatic case to be around 52 days, with a 95% confidence interval of 41-78 days.

The new method is a population dynamics-based approach, which is different from previous studies that relied on genomic data. This approach can be applied to other emerging diseases and outbreaks, making it a valuable tool for public health officials and researchers. The study's findings provide new insights into the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of understanding the delay between the emergence of a disease and its detection.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, a process essential for sexual reproduction. The model simulates the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble, taking into account both attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between non-homologous chromosomes. The model captures the trajectories of complete chromosome ensembles throughout prophase of meiosis I, allowing for comparison with experimental data and adjustments to species-specific features such as chromosome number and size, as well as nuclear dimensions.

The simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play once distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A key feature of the model is a repulsive force that shortens the time spent in non-homologous interactions, representing molecular processes that dissociate non-homologous chromosomes from each other.

The model allows for the analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of various chromosomal parameters, including chromosome number, size, and movement velocity, as well as attractive and repulsive forces, provide insights into the contributions of each of these factors to homolog pairing. The model suggests that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct, yet temporally coinciding processes: homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set, achieved via a repulsive force, and then assess similarities modeled as an attractive force.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA miR-34a, a target of p53, plays a crucial role in cancer development. Research on zebrafish has shown that miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. The miR-34 genes are highly conserved between zebrafish and humans, with similar expression timing in development. DNA damage induced by camptothecin leads to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants are viable and have normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/R217H or tp53-/- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Transcriptomic comparisons revealed that loss of miR-34a enhances erythrocyte levels and up-regulates myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppresses its reporter mRNA but not p53 target induction, and sensitizes injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. These findings suggest that miR-34a plays a crucial role in tumor suppression and DNA damage response, and its dysregulation may contribute to cancer development.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. XOL-1 expression is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, XOL-1 is highly expressed, while in hermaphrodites, it is expressed at very low levels. Previous studies suggested that XOL-1's low expression in hermaphrodites was of minimal importance in embryonic development. However, this study reveals that XOL-1 plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics techniques, researchers found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division and a more advanced transcriptional program when XOL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows that XOL-1 regulates the timing of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. The study also found that XOL-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape, which can be reversed by the loss of MET-2. These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 is a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects, which aim to control mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. MGSurvE takes into account various biological features of mosquitoes and their habitats, including food sources, breeding sites, and movement patterns, to minimize the time it takes to detect a specific allele of interest. The framework can be applied to different mosquito species, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, and can be used to detect not only gene drive mosquitoes but also insecticide-resistant alleles that compromise the effectiveness of insecticide-based tools like bednets.

MGSurvE was tested on two case studies: an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. The results show that MGSurvE can efficiently distribute traps to detect an allele of interest as quickly as possible, ideally when remediation is still viable. The framework can be used by both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. By optimizing trap placement, MGSurvE can help minimize the cost and maximize the effectiveness of genetic surveillance programs, which is critical for controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
Researchers have re-examined the microbial eukaryote Symbiomonas scintillans, which was previously thought to harbor endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, new sequencing data from two strains of S. scintillans, RCC257 and RCC24, did not detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses also failed to detect bacterial signals in the cells. Instead, the sequencing data revealed numerous contigs closely related to prasinoviruses that infect green algae, such as Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla. A near-complete draft genome of a prasinovirus, BpV, was assembled, and three similar draft viral genomes, collectively called SsVs, were identified from RCC257 and RCC24. A multi-gene tree showed that the SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of the prasinoviruses. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar in morphology and size to the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. These findings suggest that S. scintillans does not harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is instead associated with giant viruses.
Research on the leiomodin (Lmod) family of actin-binding proteins has revealed their critical role in muscle function, with mutations in all three family members (LMOD1-3) resulting in human myopathies. Specifically, mutations in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or frameshift mutations, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed.

Investigations have shown that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies the loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. Researchers have also developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) that obstruct the deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts and restoring mutant protein expression.

This study provides initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies. The findings suggest that treatment with an SBO that inhibits NMD in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2. This approach may offer a new avenue for treating LMOD-linked muscle diseases, which are characterized by short thin filaments, reduced muscle contractility, and severe muscle weakness.
Researchers investigated how different versions of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, specifically ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE4 is known to significantly increase the risk of Alzheimer's, while ApoE2 has a modest protective effect. To understand the underlying mechanisms, the researchers used transgenic mice expressing human ApoE genes to study changes in protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, in the brain and liver.

The study found that both ApoE4 and ApoE2 lead to changes in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins in the brain compared to the control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, there was a lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting impaired protein quality control. In contrast, ApoE2 mice showed an increase in degradation of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix and membrane, indicating a coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. These changes were not observed in the liver, suggesting that the ApoE effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain.

The researchers used a combination of protein abundance and turnover rates to understand the cellular regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. Their findings support existing literature linking ApoE4-dependent changes to endosomal trafficking, autophagy, proteasome activity, and mitochondrial quality. The study also suggests that ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover and proteolysis capacity. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the different effects of ApoE isoforms on Alzheimer's disease risk.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CRISPR-TRiM, which allows for tissue-specific gene knockout in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The NMJ is a crucial model system for studying various biological processes, including axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and plasticity. However, previous attempts to apply tissue-specific CRISPR to the fly NMJ have been unsuccessful. The new CRISPR-TRiM toolkit enables the knockout of genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells, and has been validated by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue. The researchers demonstrated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by showing its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system and simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. Using CRISPR-TRiM, the researchers discovered an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance and found that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Additionally, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. The CRISPR-TRiM approach has been used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity, providing new insights into the biology of the NMJ.
In Drosophila, the process of hematopoiesis, or blood cell formation, relies heavily on the stockpile of progenitor cells present in the lymph gland during larval stages. These progenitor cells accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which primes them for differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase), leading to the upregulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and facilitating progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Research has shown that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish plays a crucial role in regulating this process. Relish shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing the activation of JNK. This is achieved through the inhibition of TAK1, a developmental signal that monitors the input from ROS. As a result, the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. The study highlights the importance of integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways in regulating cell fate transition during development. The research also reveals that overexpressing Rel in progenitor cells leads to the downregulation of FAO, and that genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors results in the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, coaxing them to differentiate.
Researchers have identified a new genetic variant associated with Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS), a rare disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. The variant, RTTN c.2953A>G, was found in a patient with TALS-like symptoms, but not in the RNU4ATAC gene, which is typically associated with the disorder. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the patient was homozygous for the RTTN variant, which alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23.

Studies using patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) or cortical organoids (COs) were conducted to investigate the impact of the RTTN variant on cellular function. The results showed that RTTN-mutated NSCs accumulated in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle due to mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell arrest, or cell death. The mitotic defects were associated with slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles, which may favor premature differentiation of NSCs into neurons.

In cortical organoids, RTTN-mutated cells showed delayed apico-basal polarization of NSCs, leading to a marked delay in rosette formation and overall growth. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c.2953A>G variant and shed light on the mechanisms leading to microcephaly in TALS. The study highlights the importance of RTTN in the self-organization of NSCs into neural rosettes and its role in the development of the brain.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) adapts to prolonged periods of resource scarcity, a state known as long-term stationary phase (LTSP). They conducted a six-year experiment where E. coli populations were allowed to grow on rich media initially, but no new resources were provided. The team analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points to understand the dynamics of adaptation. The results show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically through the accumulation of mutations over six years, with a high degree of convergence across independently evolving populations. This means that similar lineages, defined by the same genetic mutations, emerge in different populations. The researchers also found that mutations often occur in the same genetic loci across populations, suggesting a historical contingency. In fact, a third of the convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association. The study demonstrates that E. coli adaptation under LTSP is characterized by high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of E. coli and other non-sporulating bacteria, which can survive long periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of LTSP. The study's results have implications for understanding how bacteria adapt to changing environments and how genetic mutations contribute to this process.
Researchers have found that the male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex, previously thought to be non-coding, actually codes for a micropeptide that plays a crucial role in determining how mated females use stored sperm. The MSA transcript is a male-specific version of the iab-8 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which is produced in both sexes in the posterior central nervous system. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, the iab-8 transcript does not, due to a repressive mechanism. This mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the two unique 5' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA, which prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. Using cell culture and transgenic analysis, researchers have shown that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to these uORFs. The iab-8 lncRNA is expressed in the posterior central nervous system, and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to the loss of a microRNA located within its intronic sequences. The MSA transcript, on the other hand, is specifically expressed in the male accessory gland and codes for a micropeptide that mediates sperm usage in mated females.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to CDG. The clinical variability of CDG suggests that modifier genes may influence the phenotypes. Researchers used evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) to identify common genetic modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. ERC analysis revealed strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with non-coding RNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. The study also identified patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. The ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allowed for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. The study's findings suggest that known CDG genes are likely candidates for genetic modifiers of other CDG, and that unexplored connections between glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis, may need to be studied together.
Researchers have discovered a crucial mechanism in the life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that involves the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the HBV core protein (HBc). The HBc protein has two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain for capsid assembly and a C-terminal domain (CTD) for pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, particularly at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for the initiation of pgRNA encapsidation. However, as capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation.

Using a specific antibody, researchers observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state of HBc-Ser170 during pgRNA packaging. They found that the viral polymerase (Pol) plays a key role in recruiting a host phosphatase, PP1, to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170. This dephosphorylation event is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and is associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs).

The study reveals that Pol may play a dual role in HBV replication by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of HBV replication and suggest that PP1 could be a potential target for antiviral development.
A recent study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. The researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena, collected on either side of the Isthmus. The study found that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, with those from the Caribbean having the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Further analysis revealed that the last common ancestor of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. The study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. The findings highlight the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 TAS2Rs, a family of bitter taste receptors, from 661 vertebrate genomes. A large-scale analysis revealed that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high number of TAS2R genes compared to other vertebrates. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters, but amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. The study found that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but the total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, the number of TAS2R genes is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays showed that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. This suggests that increases in TAS2R number may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions in specific genes, a process known as gene subfunctionalization. The study also found that the TAS2R gene family experienced a rapid expansion in frogs and salamanders, leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than any other lineage of vertebrates examined to date. This research provides new insights into the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in vertebrates, particularly in amphibians, and highlights the importance of extra-oral TAS2Rs in detecting ecologically important substances.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating transcription and its impact on intestinal stem cells. They found that a tri-protein complex containing Notch intracellular domain (NICD), RBPj, and MAML1 binds DNA as a monomer or dimer to regulate transcription. Mice with Notch dimerization-deficient alleles (NDD) were more sensitive to environmental insults but developed and aged normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation, but did show impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro and an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts.

Further investigation using TurboID and mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line revealed an unbalanced interactome in Notch2 dimerization-deficient cells, with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved interaction with the histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) interactome. Treatment with the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid (VPA) prevented the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. These findings suggest that Notch dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about the overall proteome environment, with indirect consequences for innate immunity and barrier functions.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection, a process by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, to account for the effects of migration in structured populations. Background selection can be divided into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are low, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are high. Previous studies have focused on the effects of background selection on total neutral diversity (πT) and genetic differentiation (FST) in the background selection regime. However, the impact of migration on background selection in the interference selection regime has not been fully understood. This study derives novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extends previous theory to make predictions in an island model. Simulations show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. The results suggest that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly in metapopulations with a larger effective population size. The study further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans.
Researchers have developed a new tool called FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among institutions while protecting sensitive genetic information. The tool uses a federated statistical testing approach to correct for confounding factors and polygenic random effects in genetic association studies. This approach ensures that genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and intermediate statistics are protected by encryption.

The development of FedGMMAT addresses a significant methodological barrier in performing high-powered studies, which often require large and heterogeneous sample sizes. Traditional statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, are necessary to correct for confounders that may bias results. However, these approaches can be computationally complex and require significant resources.

FedGMMAT is designed to be flexible and can integrate multiple subject-level random effects, making it suitable for various study designs. The tool uses homomorphic encryption and a symmetric One-Time Pad-like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics while aggregating them in a federated setting. This approach allows for efficient and secure data analysis without compromising data privacy.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of FedGMMAT using simulated and real datasets, showing that it can achieve similar results to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. The development of FedGMMAT has the potential to alleviate the issues surrounding data sharing and collaboration in genetic association studies, ultimately advancing our understanding of the genetic determinants of diseases.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to predict disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, the accuracy of these scores varies across different populations, particularly in African and Asian populations. To address this issue, a recent study benchmarked the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. The study found modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared to a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores.

The researchers used a comprehensive analysis across two biobank-scale datasets to evaluate the performance of the six algorithms, which are based on variant prioritization, continuous shrinkage, joint analysis of summary statistics, functional annotation, fine mapping, and population-specific heritability estimates. The study found that hierarchical clustering is adequate to stratify polygenic scores by ancestry. The results suggest that PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone.

The study also evaluated the performance of publicly available polygenic risk scores in the testing dataset and found that predictive performance improved upon integration of participant age and polygenic score. The addition of family history and BMI did not increase predictive power. Overall, the study demonstrates the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset and shows that genetic risk coupled with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer.
Researchers have identified potential new treatments for DPAGT1-CDG, a congenital disorder of glycosylation that currently lacks effective therapies. The disorder is caused by mutations in the DPAGT1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. To find new treatments, scientists used a Drosophila (fruit fly) model of DPAGT1-CDG with a small, improperly developed eye phenotype. They performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1,520 small molecules, 98% of which are approved by the FDA or EMA. The screen identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the eye phenotype of the DPAGT1-CDG model.

Further analysis revealed that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. This suggests that dopamine signaling is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. The researchers also found that loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, linking dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation. This discovery represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG.

In addition to the dopamine-related findings, the researchers genetically validated other top drug categories, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms and may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG. Overall, this study provides new insights into the biology of DPAGT1-CDG and identifies potential new treatments for this disorder.
Researchers have developed a computational model called the topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to better understand how the brain processes proprioception, the sense of body position and movement. Proprioception is essential for controlling movement, but the way it is represented in the brain is not well understood. The topo-VAE model uses a large dataset of natural movement data to create a map of the brain's somatosensory cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for processing sensory information from the body.

The model was able to reproduce two key features of proprioception observed in monkey studies: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of neuronal preferred directions recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model also made several testable predictions, including that encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of preferred directions, and that few neurons will encode just a single joint.

The topo-VAE model provides a principled basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with potential applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. The model's ability to generalize to other regions of the sensory cortex and its minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality make it a valuable tool for understanding the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene in plant growth and development, as well as plant responses to stress. However, the role of ethylene in microbes has been less studied. A recent study focused on Azospirillum brasilense, a bacterium that associates with plant roots, and found that it contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 (AzoEtr1). This receptor directly binds ethylene with high affinity, and treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. The study also found that ethylene causes widespread metabolic changes in the bacterium, affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and leading to the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. The researchers propose a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. This study provides new insights into the role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions and identifies potential targets for regulating beneficial interactions between plants and microbes. The discovery of a functional ethylene receptor in A. brasilense is significant, as it is the first to be described in a proteobacterium, and highlights the importance of further research into the role of ethylene in plant-microbe associations.
Researchers investigated the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. The INO80 protein is a key component of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. Immunolocalization studies showed that INO80 is present at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting its involvement in the meiotic sex body. Deletion of the Ino80 gene resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, indicating that INO80 is essential for silencing these genes.

Further analysis revealed that the active form of RNA polymerase II was present at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. The recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition (MSCI) was also reduced in the absence of INO80. This suggests that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes.

The study found that INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on the sex chromosomes, independent of the histone variant H2A.Z. INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema. The initial deposition of γH2A.X at the synapse axis of sex chromosomes initiates INO80-facilitated recruitment of MDC1, amplifying γH2A.X in chromatin loops in an INO80-facilitated ATR-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that INO80 plays a critical role in DNA repair factor localization, facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema.
Researchers have identified a key factor in the process of axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm. The factor, called SVH-1, is a growth factor that belongs to the HGF/plasminogen family and plays a dual role in promoting axon regeneration and regulating early development. However, the mechanism by which SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration is not well understood.

A study has found that cytidine deaminase (CDD) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a crucial role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. The researchers discovered that a specific codon exchange in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the defect in axon regeneration caused by the absence of CDD-2. Additionally, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1.

The study suggests that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA. This finding provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration and may have implications for the development of therapies to promote nerve repair in humans.
Researchers used zebrafish to explore the possibility of controlling collective behavior in biological systems by modifying the characteristics of individual constituents. They genetically modified zebrafish to lack the col11a2 gene, which causes early onset of osteoarthritis, and observed changes in their collective behavior. The mutant fish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their bodies less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more orderly collective motion than wild-type fish.

The researchers used a simple active matter model to capture the collective behavior of both wild-type and mutant fish. The model treated the fish as self-propelling agents with varying levels of orientational noise. The mutant fish were modeled with higher orientational noise on average, which explained their less orderly behavior. However, when grouped together, the mutant fish exhibited increased persistence length, indicating more orderly collective motion.

This study demonstrates the potential of genetic modification to control collective behavior in biological systems at the level of individual constituents. By changing the characteristics of the constituents, the researchers were able to tune the state space occupied by the system when interpreted with a simple active matter model. This approach can be used to study the relationship between genetic traits and physiological changes in the body, and may have implications for understanding and treating diseases such as osteoarthritis.
Researchers have developed a hybrid model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical stimuli to predict the behavior of endothelial cells and the development of capillary-like networks. The model uses the Cellular Potts model to simulate individual cell migration and morphology changes, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transport dynamics. The results show that the model accurately predicts the formation of capillary-like networks, with elongated cells connecting to form network cords and round cells gathering to create cobblestone-like aggregates.

The model reveals that the development of capillary-like networks relies on the simultaneous interaction of mechanical and chemical cues. The soluble form of VEGF in the culture medium induces morphological changes in endothelial cells, while the bound form of VEGF on the biogel surface provides orientational signals. Adequate biogel deformation, a sufficient amount of bound VEGF, and a gradient of bound VEGF are necessary for the formation of a well-developed capillary-like network. The model also highlights the importance of considering both mechanical and chemical regulation in the development of capillary networks, as omitting either factor can lead to incomplete or inaccurate results.
Researchers have investigated the role of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) ligands in the immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to bacterial pathogens. The TGF-β family consists of secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis. In C. elegans, there are five TGF-β ligands, which can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies. The study found that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens, and multiple ligand pairs act non-redundantly as part of this response. The two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2 and TIG-3, a TGF-β/Activin-like ligand, function together. Structural modeling suggests that TIG-2 and TIG-3 can form heterodimers. The study also identified TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. The canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These findings demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
Researchers have identified a new role for the enzyme N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in yeast cells. The DDR is a critical process that helps maintain genome integrity by repairing or removing damaged DNA. The study found that yeast cells lacking Nat4 are more sensitive to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than normal cells. When DNA damage occurs, the Nat4 gene is activated, and the enzyme is recruited to the site of the damage.

The researchers discovered that Nat4 plays a key role in the DNA damage signaling cascade by modifying histone H4, a protein that helps package DNA. Specifically, Nat4 acetylates the N-terminus of histone H4, which is essential for the proper activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. This checkpoint is a critical response to DNA damage, allowing cells to pause the cell cycle and repair the damage before continuing to divide.

The study found that cells lacking Nat4 have impaired DNA damage checkpoint activation, leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Rad53. This suggests that Nat4's N-terminal acetyltransferase activity is necessary for the proper functioning of the DNA damage response. The researchers conclude that Nat4 is a novel player in the DDR, shedding light on a new histone-modifying activity that helps maintain genome integrity. This discovery expands the repertoire of histone modifiers involved in the DDR and highlights the importance of Nat4 in regulating the response to DNA damage in yeast cells.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells, known as cancer phylogenies. These phylogenies provide valuable insights into cancer development and can guide treatment strategies. Existing methods for reconstructing cancer phylogenies using bulk DNA sequencing data become inaccurate when dealing with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Orchard is a fast and accurate algorithm that can reconstruct phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. It samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, which is a novel result derived in this paper. The algorithm optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Orchard's large and accurate phylogenies are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. The algorithm can reliably reconstruct extremely large mutation trees, alleviating the need to pre-cluster mutations, and can recover larger trees on simulated data.
Researchers have developed a new approach called ImmugenX to predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which are proteins produced by cancer cells that can trigger an immune response. Immunogenicity prediction is a crucial step in developing personalized cancer treatments, as it allows for targeted and effective therapies. ImmugenX is a modular language model that uses a combination of protein language modeling and machine learning to predict the likelihood of a neoantigen being recognized by the immune system.

The model consists of three main components: a peptide-MHC (pMHC) encoding module, an optional T-cell receptor (TCR) encoding module, and a set of context-specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. The pMHC module is trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, including binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability. ImmugenX outperforms state-of-the-art models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.619 and an average precision of 0.514.

When integrated with TCR context information, ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction. The model's performance is also analyzed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing immunogenicity models and potential biases in public datasets. ImmugenX provides a strong framework for immunogenicity prediction using a modular protein language model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on publicly available CD8+ reactivity data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association analysis on 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness. They found a significant association between the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) gene and meat color, with a P-value of 8.65E-08. Further analysis using Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness and redness. Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout (PPP1CC-SSKO) mice were generated, which showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in limb muscles, as well as a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and targeted metabolome analysis revealed that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes, and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intron of PPP1CC was found to regulate gene transcription activity. The study identified PPP1CC as the causative gene for meat color, and a novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits within retinal ganglion cells. By using STR, scientists can identify subunits across a wide range of model variations and potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within a few tens of minutes of recording time. This makes it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

The technique, STR, sharpens subunit responses by presenting stimuli at varying positions and angles, allowing for a tomographic reconstruction of subunits. It combines the principles of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and tomographic imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans. Researchers tested STR using a comprehensive model and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. The results show that STR can reliably identify subunits, leaving ample recording time to study the retinal circuitry in-depth.

By knowing the subunit locations, scientists can manufacture targeted stimuli to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities, and functional synaptic weight of each subunit. This information can be used to evaluate the similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field. The new method has the potential to significantly reduce the required recording time, making it a valuable tool for studying the retina's functional architecture.
Researchers have developed a new statistical method called CRISPRi-DR to analyze data from CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiments. CRISPRi is a technology used to study chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs) by identifying genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics. The new method, CRISPRi-DR, incorporates both the efficiency of CRISPRi mutants and the concentration of a drug in a modified dose-response equation. This allows for the identification of genes that interact with antibiotics in a synergistic manner, where the depletion of a target protein induces excess depletion or enrichment of mutants grown in the presence of an inhibitor.

The CRISPRi-DR method requires multiple CRISPRi guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for each target gene, varying in predicted strength, and experimental quantification of sgRNA efficiencies in control conditions. The method is designed to capture the non-linear interaction between sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration, where the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength.

The researchers applied CRISPRi-DR to a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The results show that CRISPRi-DR is competitive with other analytical methods and maintains higher precision, especially in noisier datasets. The method can be generalized to non-CGI datasets and has the potential to identify genes that interact with antibiotics, providing insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance.
Researchers developed a new method to analyze gene co-expression networks, which are complex datasets that show how genes interact with each other. Traditional methods assume that genes are organized into groups, or modules, that are more connected to each other than to genes in other groups. However, this assumption may not always be true. The new method, called the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), does not assume that modules exist and instead tries to identify groups of genes based on their interactions. Using data from fruit flies, the researchers found that the SBM identified many more groups of genes than traditional methods and that some of these groups were not organized in a modular way. They also found that these non-modular groups were just as biologically meaningful as the modular groups. This suggests that the structure of gene co-expression networks is more complex than previously thought and that the assumption of modularity may not be the main driver of gene interactions. The study highlights the need to consider alternative ways of organizing gene interactions and to use multiple sources of information to understand biological networks. The researchers also suggest that combining community detection methods with network inference, which estimates the strength of gene-gene connections, may provide a more accurate understanding of gene interactions.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC ) in yeast cells to understand its involvement in post-transcriptional control. They used mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing, and ribosome sequencing to analyze the effects of PABPC deletion on the yeast proteome and transcriptome. The results showed that PABPC deletion led to significant changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The researchers found that the defects in translation initiation and mRNA stabilization in PABPC-depleted cells were partly due to reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex. Additionally, PABPC-depleted cells exhibited a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in translation termination. The study suggests that PABPC plays a crucial role in multiple aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, and its deletion has a profound impact on the cell. The findings are consistent with previous studies in mammalian cells, which also showed significant changes in the transcriptome upon PABPC depletion. The study provides new insights into the complex role of PABPC in translation initiation and termination, and highlights the importance of understanding the direct and indirect effects of PABPC deletion on cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism that contributes to the generation of slow brain rhythms, such as those observed during sleep or seizures. This mechanism involves the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and the slow dynamics of extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase). The study used mathematical modeling and bifurcation analysis to demonstrate that this coupling can generate a hysteresis loop, leading to bistable regions that are characteristic of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts of activity, tonic spiking, or depolarization block can occur. The researchers suggest that disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia, can lead to transitions between these dynamics. This minimal mechanistic model can contribute to a better understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and may inform therapeutic strategies. The study highlights the ubiquitous nature of this mechanism, which can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond. The findings are supported by previous studies that have shown that accumulated extracellular potassium can influence neuronal dynamics and provide a feedback signal. The research demonstrates that the interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions, providing a new perspective on the generation of diverse spiking dynamics.
Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping has overlooked aspects such as clustering stability and the critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Current frameworks lack a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering methods, highlighting a significant gap in methodology. To address this, a new R-package called COPS has been developed for the robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. The framework was applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models, and the stability of the results. The study found that Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. The results emphasize the importance of multi-objective evaluation and the need to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance.
Researchers have studied the role of the SoxC protein SEM-2 in the development of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and for specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. A new study identified a partial loss-of-function allele of sem-2 with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the DNA-binding domain. This mutation revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage, including antagonistic regulation of dorsoventral patterning with the FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor LET-381. SEM-2 also regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor hlh-8, which is critical for proper patterning of the M lineage. The study found that SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. These findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The research adds to the understanding of the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and sheds light on the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. Previous studies have identified multiple transcription factors and signaling components essential for M lineage development, including LIN-12/Notch signaling and the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9. SoxC proteins, including SEM-2, have a conserved DNA-binding domain, serine-rich region, and transactivation domain. The study provides new insights into the relationships between various factors important in M lineage development and the sole SoxC transcription factor SEM-2.
