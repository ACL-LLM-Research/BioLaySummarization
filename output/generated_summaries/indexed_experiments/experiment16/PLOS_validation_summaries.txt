Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in human B-lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation. They found that transcript end positions did not occur randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked locations of 3′ regulatory elements, including microRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. Independent experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on gene expression and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements. The study focused on the immune regulator IRF5 and established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. The results highlight the importance of two mechanisms in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The study suggests that integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a critical tool in interpreting human genome variation. The findings also imply that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population.
A live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine, SIVΔnef, has been shown to be highly effective in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective efficacy are not well understood. Researchers used deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to investigate the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. They found that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection targeted more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. As a result, the CD8 T cell repertoire expanded to target highly conserved epitopes, known as anentropic specificity, and generated new responses to escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These findings correlated SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. The researchers also demonstrated that escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses were maintained as central memory CD8 T cells, contributing to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination. Furthermore, the study showed that epitope escape and the generation of new CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants resulted in a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire. These results highlight the importance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design, rendering SIVΔnef a proof-of-concept vaccine for HIV/SIV vaccine research.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a crucial role in coordinating the neutrophil response to Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa. Research using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) has shown that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for controlling fungal growth and dissemination. IL-1R signaling regulates the neutrophil response in two ways: by recruiting circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and by mobilizing newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Mice deficient in IL-1R (Il1r1-/-) displayed impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control, leading to increased fungal loads in the tongue.

The study found that IL-1R signaling is critical for the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells, which attracts neutrophils to the site of infection. Additionally, IL-1R signaling regulates the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the circulation, which is essential for neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow. Endothelial cells were identified as the primary source of G-CSF during OPC, responding to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. This IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. These findings establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection, highlighting the importance of IL-1R signaling in preventing fungal growth and dissemination in the oral mucosa.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals in 48 endemic countries through annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs. This significant achievement resulted in an estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the program. The economic benefits were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and analyzing the savings associated with disease prevention in terms of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system.

The study found that the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis resulted in over $2.3 billion in economic benefits. Additionally, the halting of the progression of the disease in over 28 million individuals already infected with LF resulted in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. Furthermore, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saved the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. The study concludes that MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, with a high economic rate of return, making the GPELF an excellent investment in global health.
Researchers have developed a new animal model to study Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. The model, created in medaka fish, displays characteristics similar to the neuronopathic form of GD in humans, including the accumulation of Gaucher cells in the brain, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Unlike humans and mice with GBA mutations, the medaka fish survived for months, allowing researchers to study the disease progression.

The study found that GBA mutations lead to lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. However, disrupting α-syn did not improve the life span, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in the medaka fish. This suggests that α-syn may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD.

The researchers also found that GBA mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of α-syn in the brain. The study highlights the importance of understanding the pathological mechanisms of GBA mutations and the development of novel therapies for GD and PD. The medaka model provides a valuable tool for studying the disease progression and testing potential treatments.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that can live inside host cells. They found that when L. monocytogenes is contained within a phagosome, a type of cellular compartment, it suppresses the immune response. This suppression is not due to inefficient antigen presentation, but rather a direct effect on the adaptive immune response. The study showed that the presence of phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the rapid production of IL-10, a cytokine that can suppress the immune response. The researchers found that blocking the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88, a protein involved in the immune response, restored protective immunity. This suggests that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells. The study also found that co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited the expansion of antigen-specific T cells. These findings have implications for understanding how microbes interact with the immune system and controlling their pathogenic effects.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The study focused on the SIX6 gene, which plays a role in ocular development and has been linked to the morphology of the optic nerve. By sequencing the SIX6 gene in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, the researchers found six nonsynonymous coding variants, including one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was significantly associated with POAG. The variants were tested in a zebrafish model to evaluate their effects on eye development. The results showed that five variants, primarily found in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. Furthermore, the study found that patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) had a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than those homozygous for the non-risk allele (Asn141). This suggests that SIX6 risk variants may disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells and an increased risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss. The findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying POAG and highlight the importance of the SIX6 gene in ocular development.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch, known as the flagellar switch, that controls the production of flagella and toxins in the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile. This switch, located upstream of the flgB operon, is a 154-base pair invertible sequence flanked by 21-base pair inverted repeats. The orientation of the flagellar switch determines whether the bacteria express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. When the switch is in the "flg phase ON" orientation, bacteria express flagellar and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. In contrast, when the switch is in the "flg phase OFF" orientation, bacteria are attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, are aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion.

The researchers found that the orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro and that a C. difficile-specific regulatory factor is required to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. The flagellar switch affects transcription of the toxin genes by way of σD, impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C. difficile. The findings suggest that flagellar motility and toxin production are subject to phase variation in C. difficile, identifying an additional level of regulation of these linked processes.
Researchers studied the process of spore formation in Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that causes intestinal infections. This process, called endosporulation, results in a highly resistant spore that is central to the bacterium's infectious cycle. The study focused on the sigma factors, proteins that regulate gene expression during spore formation. In the model organism Bacillus subtilis, four sigma factors (σF, σE, σG, and σK) are known to control gene expression in the forespore and mother cell during endosporulation.

The researchers found that the genes for these sigma factors are conserved in spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile. However, the study revealed differences in the function and timing of the sigma factors in C. difficile compared to B. subtilis. Specifically, the activity of σE was found to be partially independent of σF, and σG activity was not dependent on σE. Additionally, the activity of σK did not require σG, and σK was not strictly necessary for the formation of heat-resistant spores.

The study suggests that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved across species, with the sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway. However, the results also indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors in C. difficile compared to B. subtilis. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of endosporulation and the role of sigma factors in this process.
Researchers have developed a new framework to model the behavior of proteins with multiple sites that can be modified, such as through phosphorylation. This framework, called the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model, simplifies complex systems by using a single variable to describe the protein's activity. The MWC model can accurately replicate the behavior of more detailed models and is useful for analyzing systems where multiple proteins interact simultaneously. The researchers applied this framework to a newly discovered cell size checkpoint in budding yeast, which measures cell growth by monitoring signals at the plasma membrane. They found that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch, meaning that the response is all-or-none and triggered only when the signal reaches a certain threshold. This system consists of a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response. The MWC model can also be extended to other types of multisite modifications, such as ligand binding, transcription factor regulation, and ubiquitination. The researchers demonstrated the versatility of the MWC model by applying it to a detailed mechanistic model of the cell size checkpoint. The model assumes that the protein is phosphorylated by a kinase at multiple sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, and that the system is nonsequential, meaning that there are different phosphoforms of the protein.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the quorum sensing (QS) system of E. coli, a mechanism that enables bacteria to communicate and coordinate their behavior. Quorum sensing is a complex process that involves the interplay of multiple regulatory components, making it challenging to decipher its underlying mechanisms. To tackle this complexity, scientists employed a "bottom-up" approach, breaking down the QS system into smaller sub-networks and analyzing each component separately. This approach allowed them to identify a new negative feedback interaction and reveal the crucial role of the LsrR regulator in the QS "switch" of E. coli.

The researchers used a combination of experimental work and mathematical modeling to study the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system in E. coli. They separated the network architecture into sub-networks and examined the propagation of the native signal molecule, AI-2. By analyzing each module separately, they were able to identify new regulatory interactions within the network and construct a hypothetical model of the system. This model was used to simulate the behavior of the intact network and its sub-systems, providing a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures.

The study highlights the importance of using a bottom-up approach to analyze complex biological networks, particularly when positive and negative regulations exist within the network architecture. This approach allowed the researchers to uncover the determinant role of LsrR in the E. coli QS "switch," which was previously masked by interfering regulatory loops. The findings of this study have implications for understanding QS network architectures and may guide the development of new biotechnological applications.
Researchers conducted a study in rural Gabon to investigate the impact of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma haematobium, on the prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children. The study found that schistosomiasis tends to increase the risk of Plasmodium infection, but when combined with soil-transmitted helminths (STH), such as Trichuris trichiura or hookworm, the risk of Plasmodium infection is significantly increased. The study also found that the incidence of malaria was higher in children infected with Schistosoma haematobium compared to those who were not infected, with a significant delay in the time-to-first-malaria event in children aged 6-10 years. The results suggest that STH enhance the risk of Plasmodium infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and that schistosomiasis increases susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. The study highlights the importance of considering STH and schistosomiasis control as an additional tool in malaria control programs in areas where these infections are co-endemic.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor IRF-5 in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. They found that IRF-5-induced inflammation limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) in dendritic cells. HIF-1α impairs dendritic cell functions, leading to a decrease in IL-12 expression and an increase in IL-10 expression. This results in a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells and reduced CD8+ T cell expansion. Mice with a targeted depletion of HIF-1α in dendritic cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that HIF-1α induction is an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. The study suggests that IRF-5-mediated inflammation at early stages of infection plays a detrimental role in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses. The findings indicate that targeting HIF-1α in dendritic cells may be a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance CD8+ T cell responses and control Leishmania infection.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to identify risk factors for adverse prognosis and death in American visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease with high fatality rates in Latin America. The study analyzed 14 studies from Brazil, which were selected from a comprehensive survey of 2,945 studies. The researchers used a tool to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies and synthesized information on prognostic variables using meta-analysis.

The strongest predictors of adverse prognosis and death in VL patients were identified as jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The study found that Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a significant prognostic factor, with coinfected individuals having a higher risk of poor prognosis.

The researchers noted that the lack of reduction in fatality rates of VL in Brazil can be attributed to limitations in therapy, delayed diagnosis, and inadequate management of high-risk patients. The study suggests that identifying prognostic factors associated with VL can be a valuable tool for clinical practice. However, the development of externally validated prognostic models is a priority for future research, as the current models lack validation procedures. The study highlights the need for improved management of VL patients, particularly those at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes.
Researchers in Algeria investigated the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimony, a common treatment for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, over a 30-year period. The study analyzed 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. The researchers determined the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb(III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)) in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The study found a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) isolates during the 30-year period, but an increase in the frequency of insusceptible (S-) phenotypes in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) isolates was observed. The emergence of S- phenotypes was associated with the inclusion of Leishmania killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates, which cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria in the last decade. The study highlights the need for an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains. The results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and emphasize the importance of preserving the therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishmaniasis.
Researchers have investigated the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition. They found that exposure to certain foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium, can increase the risk of CD in individuals colonized with a specific type of bacteria called adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). AIEC is a pathobiont, a type of bacteria that normally resides in the gut but can contribute to disease under certain conditions.

The study used two new models to examine the relationship between acute infectious gastroenteritis and CD in mice colonized with AIEC. The results showed that AIEC-colonized mice that developed infectious gastroenteritis had a worse outcome compared to AIEC-naive animals exposed to the same infection. The researchers found that the tissue-associated expansion of AIEC in the post-infectious period was driven by the bacteria's resistance to host defense peptides and a strong inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in immune cells in the gut of AIEC-colonized mice after infectious gastroenteritis, indicating a heightened inflammatory environment. The study suggests that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. The findings identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, which could be targeted in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.
Researchers have identified a gene called Lachesis (LIS) that plays a crucial role in determining the fate of cells in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, a flowering plant. The female gametophyte contains two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, which are essential for fertilization, as well as five accessory cells. However, the mechanisms that control the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate were previously unknown.

The researchers isolated a mutant called lachesis (lis) that forms supernumerary egg cells, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate into gametic cells, suggesting that LIS represses gametic cell fate in accessory cells. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells.

Further analysis revealed that LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions. The lis-1 mutant phenotype shows two levels of cell fate regulation: one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cell. The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling cell fate decisions in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in a rural highland Ethiopian community to understand the barriers to wearing shoes, which is crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The study used the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological factors influencing shoe use among children. The researchers gathered information from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies.

The study found that shoe-wearing norms are changing in the community, with going barefoot becoming increasingly seen as "shameful." However, many practical and social barriers prevent people from wearing shoes regularly. Limited financial resources make it difficult for people to purchase and maintain shoes, leading to shoes being reserved for special occasions. As a result, children often do not receive shoes until they reach a certain age.

The study identified several barriers to shoe wearing, including financial constraints, poor suitability of shoes for daily activities, and low risk perception of NTDs. These barriers are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs, not just podoconiosis, a disease triggered by exposure to irritant soils in the tropical highlands. The study suggests that targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing could be an effective way to improve shoe use and prevent NTDs. The findings have implications for those implementing footwear programs and highlight the need to address underlying structural barriers related to poverty.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons. Research has shown that Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. To understand how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of viral proteins, scientists investigated the association of Us9 with lipid rafts on the surface of infected cells. Lipid rafts are microdomains on the cell membrane that are rich in cholesterol and play a key role in protein sorting and trafficking.

The study found that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts and that this association is critical for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. In non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that mimics sympathetic neurons, Us9 was highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. These findings suggest that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is essential for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus transmission and highlights the importance of lipid rafts in viral protein sorting and trafficking.
Researchers have found that genetically identical cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit variations in growth rate and stress tolerance, a phenomenon known as nongenetic heterogeneity. This variation is significant in clinical contexts, such as within tumors and microbial infections, where cells show differences in growth rate and susceptibility to drugs or stress. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast cells.

Using genetic and chemical perturbations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, the researchers found that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, acting through the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance.

Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. The results suggest that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, acting through Msn2 and Msn4, underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance, and that manipulating this pathway may provide a means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.
Researchers analyzed the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) during an outbreak in the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in 2013-2014. They used deep-sequencing technologies to study the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals and understand how the virus may have evolved during the outbreak. The analysis revealed changes in the consensus sequence and a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. The researchers also found that the overall diversity of the virus was reduced after a single passage in cell lines. Furthermore, they constructed an infectious clone of the virus and identified a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure not previously found in nature, which led to increased replication in insect cells. This new UTR structure was unique among circulating CHIKV strains worldwide. The study highlights the need for continued viral diversity surveillance over time to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. The research provides an in-depth look at the minority variants present during the outbreak, identifying novel variants and structural elements. The findings suggest that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time since entering the naive population in the Americas. The study's results agree with previous research, placing the viruses in the Asian Lineage of CHIKV and clustering with the St. Martin strain CNR20236.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene called UBTOR, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and the mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR signaling is involved in various human diseases, including cancer. The study found that reducing UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth and cell growth. Conversely, overexpressing UBTOR suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complex, to inhibit mTOR signaling. In zebrafish models, disrupting the UBTOR gene upregulates mTOR signaling and promotes tumor formation induced by the HRAS G12V mutation. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrate that UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia through mTOR signaling. The study also showed that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes, and that NGF treatment upregulates UBTOR expression. The results suggest that UBTOR may play a role in keeping mTOR signaling activity in check. Overall, the study highlights the importance of UBTOR in regulating cell growth and neoplasia, and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein complexes in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. This parasite is highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes, making it difficult to determine the functions of many of its proteins. To address this challenge, the researchers used biochemical fractionation to systematically study the interactions of over 3,300 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei. Their analysis identified 128 high-confidence complexes, including 635 previously uncharacterized proteins, and validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery. The study provides an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei and serves as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. The researchers used this map to reveal novel factors involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei and validated their findings through independent experiments. This study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date, offering a valuable resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and experimental leads.
Researchers studied lymph nodes (LNs) in macaques infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. They found that LNs are not just sites where the immune system fights infection, but also where Mtb bacteria can persist for a long time. The study used PET CT scans to track inflammation in LNs and found that LNs in infected macaques showed increased metabolic activity early in the infection. At the time of death, almost all LNs with high metabolic activity contained live Mtb bacteria or Mtb DNA.

The researchers compared two types of macaques, cynomolgus and rhesus, and found that rhesus macaques were more susceptible to Mtb infection due to more extensive LN pathology. However, Mtb grew to the same level in LNs of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaques were able to control the infection better than rhesus macaques. LNs were found to be poor at killing Mtb, even with treatment, and the formation of granulomas in LNs disrupted their structure and allowed Mtb to persist.

The study suggests that LNs play a crucial role in the persistence of Mtb infection, and that their structure and function are affected by the infection. The findings have implications for understanding how Mtb infection progresses and how it can be treated. Overall, the study highlights the importance of LNs in the immune response to Mtb infection and the need for further research into the role of LNs in tuberculosis.
Researchers have identified a large collection of novel microsporidia, a type of fungus-related intracellular pathogen, that infect nematodes, a group of worm-like animals. These microsporidia were isolated from wild nematodes, including Caenorhabditis elegans, a commonly used model organism in scientific research. The study found that Nematocida parisii is the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild, and six new species in the Nematocida genus were identified. Additionally, two new subclades, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, were discovered, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. The microsporidia were found to infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates in the epidermis of its host. The study also showed that some microsporidia have broad host specificity, while others have narrow host specificity. For example, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and vice versa. Furthermore, the study found that Nematocida ausubeli has evolved mechanisms to prevent the induction of a host response in C. elegans. The discovery of these novel microsporidia and their diverse interactions with nematodes provides a rich resource for investigating host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.
Chemokine receptors, a type of G protein-coupled receptor, play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. Research has shown that homo- and heterodimers of chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2, can modulate receptor function. However, the structural information about these dimers and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the homo- and heterodimerization patterns of these receptors at an atomic level. The results show that the closely related CC chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CCR2, have similar homodimerization patterns, but differ significantly from CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulates the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. The study also found distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimers, with CXCR4/CCR5 showing increased cholesterol sensitivity. This research provides a comprehensive structural overview of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and highlights how heterodimerization and interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related G protein-coupled receptors. The findings suggest that cholesterol can increase the dynamic range and versatility of associations between closely related transmembrane receptors.
Researchers have identified a previously unknown form of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite. This new form, referred to as "atypical" systemic leishmaniasis, presents with a range of symptoms that differ from the classical form of the disease. In the classical form, patients typically experience prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), and wasting. In contrast, patients with atypical systemic leishmaniasis may exhibit symptoms such as lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes) and anemia, but lack one or two of the classical symptoms.

A study of 160 patients with suspected immune deficiency found that 19.4% had normal laboratory profiles, but their macrophages (a type of immune cell) were infected with Leishmania parasites. This discovery revealed the presence of atypical systemic leishmaniasis, which can masquerade as a condition with a non-functional immune system. As a result, patients with this form of the disease are prone to recurrent secondary infections, leading to a wide range of symptoms.

The study also found that atypical systemic leishmaniasis is not limited to the pediatric age group, as adults were also affected. The researchers recommend that healthcare providers consider atypical systemic leishmaniasis in patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. This new form of the disease is more common than previously thought and presents a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected.
Researchers have analyzed millions of mutations and polymorphisms in human populations to identify potential predictors of disease, drug reactions, microbial infections, and age-related conditions. However, predicting the phenotypic consequences of a sequence variant is a complex task. A new study has explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins to identify polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. The researchers assembled a collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD databases and identified pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. The study found that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This information can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The researchers also found that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non-disease-causing variants along their lengths. This study provides a novel resource for functional genomics and suggests that paralogous human genes can be used to identify new disease gene candidates and uncharacterized variants likely to have phenotypic consequences.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria. They used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in 44 parasite isolates from Papuan patients. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had altered gene expression compared to those causing uncomplicated malaria. Specifically, they found that severe malaria parasites had decreased glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and reduced expression of surface antigens called PfEMP1. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity.

The study also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. These findings suggest that parasites adapt to or are selected by the host environment in severe malaria. The researchers found that severe malaria parasites down-regulated genes involved in PfEMP1 surface expression, which may explain why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than immunity to uncomplicated malaria. The study's results will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and provide insights into how the parasite responds to the host environment in severe malaria. The findings also suggest that the parasite's surface antigens may play a key role in the development of severe malaria.
Researchers have explored a promising approach to prevent HIV-1 infection by delivering potent, broadly-neutralizing antibodies using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. In a study, rhesus monkeys were given AAV-delivered anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG1 form, achieving persisting levels of up to 270 micrograms per milliliter. However, host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in nine of the 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody. Despite this, the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed significant protective effects against the SIVmac239 challenge virus, including lower viral load at peak height and set point, and a delay in the time to peak viral load. Notably, one monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb resisted six successive SIVmac239 challenges, including a final challenge with a high dose of infectious virus. This study demonstrates the potential of AAV-delivered antibodies for HIV-1 prevention, but highlights the need to overcome the problem of anti-antibody responses for this approach to be effective. AAV vectors have been shown to be safe and effective in human gene therapy trials, and have the potential to deliver proteins at stable levels for years. The study suggests that AAV-delivered antibodies could provide a sterilizing barrier to HIV-1 infection, but further research is needed to address the issue of anti-antibody responses.
Research on protein dynamics has traditionally relied on the assumption that proteins respond linearly to thermal noise and structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment. However, a study of two motor proteins, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, has found that this assumption is not always valid. The researchers used a coarse-grained elastic network approximation to investigate the conformational relaxation properties of these proteins and discovered that nonlinear effects play a significant role in their dynamics.

The study found that the normal mode description, which is commonly used to analyze protein dynamics, fails to accurately describe the conformational motions of KIF1A. In contrast, myosin V's slow conformational relaxation motions can still be qualitatively characterized in terms of normal modes. Despite the breakdown of the normal mode description, the researchers found that both proteins exhibit ordered and robust mechanochemical motions, which are conformational relaxation processes that follow an energetic activation.

Large-scale conformational changes in proteins, such as those caused by ligand binding, are often considered in the framework of linear response theory and normal mode approximation. However, the study's findings suggest that nonlinear effects are essential for understanding the dynamics of motor proteins like myosin V and KIF1A. The results indicate that important assumptions in the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered.
Researchers have investigated the complex interactions between different endocytic pathways in cells. Endocytosis is the process by which cells take in substances from outside their membranes. Clathrin-independent endocytosis is a type of endocytosis that does not involve the protein clathrin. The study found that specific proteins called caveolins and cavins, which are part of structures called caveolae, can regulate clathrin-independent endocytosis. Caveolins and cavins were found to inhibit the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment (CLIC/GEEC) endocytic pathway, which is a type of clathrin-independent endocytosis. This inhibition occurs independently of the formation of caveolae, which are the structures that caveolins and cavins are part of. The study also found that the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking caveolins and cavins, suggesting that these proteins play a role in regulating this pathway. Furthermore, the study found that caveolins can inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway even when they are not part of caveolae, and that this inhibition is associated with changes in the movement of lipid molecules in the cell membrane. The study also found that cavins can modulate the activity of a key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, called Cdc42. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis and the role of caveolins and cavins in this process.
Researchers have identified a subset of Receiver (REC) domains, known as Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains, which lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue typically phosphorylated by sensory histidine kinases in two-component signaling systems. These systems are crucial for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli in bacteria, Archaea, and plants. By analyzing deposited REC domain sequences, the researchers found that ALRs are surprisingly common, comprising approximately 4% of all REC domains, or about 2 per completed genome in bacteria. ALRs are often associated with rare effector outputs and have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation. This reorganization allows them to retain the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. Some ALRs have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs from small molecules, such as antibiotics, or Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases, which regulate crucial cell envelope-related functions and virulence in many microbes. The study defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains. The researchers identified various substitutions at the conserved phospho-Asp site, including Ser, Thr, Tyr, Arg, and Cys, which have the potential for phospho-regulation by different kinases and phosphatases.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that targets cancer cells by retargeting to specific receptors, such as HER2, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Unlike traditional oHSVs, these new viruses are fully virulent and retain their ability to replicate in cancer cells while sparing other cells in the tumor. The study investigated the safety and efficacy of a HER2-retargeted, fully virulent oHSV armed with interleukin-12 (IL-12) in immunocompetent mice. The results showed that the virus, named R-115, had a high safety profile and inhibited the growth of primary HER2-expressing tumors. Moreover, mice that survived the primary tumor treatment were protected from the growth of untreated contralateral tumors, indicating an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response revealed that R-115 unleashed an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and promoting Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4+ and CD335+ cells, were increased in all responder mice, while CD8+, Foxp3+, and CD141+ cells were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased in R-115-treated mice. The study demonstrated a durable response, including a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and wild-type tumor cells, and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response. These findings suggest that R-115 has potential as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.
A recent study investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. Researchers compared the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and canarypox viral vector (ALVAC) to HIV. The study found that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV, while ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Additionally, ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-β) but little IL-17. The study also found that ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Depletion of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and suggest that the choice of vaccine vector may impact the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV infection.
Researchers investigated the evolution of X inactivation strategies in mammals, a process where one X chromosome is silenced in female somatic cells. They found that the choice of which X chromosome to silence varies among species, ranging from strict paternally inherited X inactivation (PXI) to unbiased random X inactivation (RXI). PXI renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles, while RXI equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue.

The study used a theoretical population genetic analysis to examine how conditions such as dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies. The results showed that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes.

The study found that RXI is favored over PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. However, the criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic, meaning alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. The study provides a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and makes several predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.
Researchers investigated the antiviral properties of a host protein called zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIKV, and that depleting ZAP enhanced JEV replication. The study revealed that ZAP targets JEV for degradation by the 3'-5' RNA exosome complex and hampers viral translation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP are essential for its antiviral activity against JEV. The researchers identified the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of JEV, particularly a region with dumbbell structures and high CG dinucleotide content, as the binding site for ZAP. This interaction confers sensitivity to ZAP. The study suggests that ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor by binding to specific RNA sequences to combat JEV infection. The findings indicate that JEV is the first flavivirus sensitive to human ZAP, providing new insights into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral RNA without a 3'-poly(A) tail. The study also suggests that 3'-5' RNA degradation by the exosome complex is involved in the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a significant human and animal pathogen that causes severe disease, including hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. Researchers investigated the host response to RVFV infection in mice to understand the virus's pathogenesis. They compared the immune response to wild-type RVFV strain ZH501 and the attenuated vaccine strain MP-12 in C57BL/6 mice. The study found that mice infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived the infection with minimal clinical disease and a low cytokine response. In contrast, wild-type ZH501 infection was lethal, causing lymphopenia, platelet depletion, and a strong systemic cytokine response, which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. The liver was found to be a primary target of RVFV infection, with significant clinical and histological data supporting this finding. However, a pro-inflammatory response was not observed in the liver, but rather a chemokine response indicating the infiltration of immunoreactive cells. In the brains of infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. The study suggests that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver dysfunction due to necrosis and hepatitis, while the long-term course of disease is neurologic in nature, supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model.
Chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant challenge to improving patient survival. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC and found that C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) is significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. CCL20 promotes the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) through the protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Additionally, CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increases ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression, leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. A positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways is formed, providing sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. The study suggests that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking CCL20 or its downstream pathway may reverse taxane resistance in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the combination of taxane treatment and adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 may improve chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer.
Researchers have identified a novel protein complex essential for the transport of proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) of Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasma's ability to infect and manipulate its host depends on its ability to transport "GRA" proteins into the host cell, where they can hijack host cell functions and proteins. However, the process of translocation across the PVM is not well understood.

A previous study identified a protein called TgMYR1, which is essential for the transport of GRA proteins into the host cell. To further investigate this process, researchers screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 into the host cell nucleus. This led to the identification of two novel proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, which play a crucial role in the translocation of a subset of GRA proteins into the host cell.

MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole space and co-localize with the PVM and MYR1. The researchers also found that MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1, whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. Additionally, they showed that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. These findings reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.
Researchers have investigated the role of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in the replication of papillomaviruses (PVs). PVs, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1), have a unique replication program that involves three stages: initial amplification, cell cycle-linked maintenance, and differentiation-dependent amplification. The viral E2 protein plays a crucial role in recruiting the E1 DNA helicase to the viral origin, initiating replication. However, the involvement of ORC or other pre-replication complex (pre-RC) factors in PV replication has not been well understood.

The study found that the E2 protein of HPV and BPV-1 binds to ORC2, a component of the ORC complex. However, ORC2 was not detected at the viral origin, suggesting that it may not be necessary for the activation of the PV origin by E1 and E2. Instead, ORC2 appears to suppress the replicative function of E2. Depletion of ORC2 enhanced PV replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes, but had no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes.

The study also found that over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification. These findings imply that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program, and that elevated levels of E2 during the differentiation-dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins.
Researchers investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. A total of 564 cow milk samples were collected from 326 herds in 21 villages. Brucella DNA was detected in 10.3% of the samples using a real-time PCR test. The presence of Brucella DNA was found in both seropositive and seronegative cows, with 100% of seropositive cows and 8.3% of seronegative cows testing positive. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggested that one cow was infected with Brucella abortus and another cow was likely infected with Brucella melitensis. The study highlights the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. The findings also suggest that vaccination of cattle with S19, in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1, may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. Further research is required to understand the Brucella species circulating among livestock in the region. The study's results are concerning, given the common consumption of unpasteurized dairy products in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) in maintaining chromosome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This fungus has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable and transcriptionally repressed. The researchers deleted the genes responsible for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, a related histone modification, in Z. tritici and analyzed the effects on chromosome and genome stability. They found that the absence of H3K9me3 led to dramatic chromatin reorganization, with H3K27me3 being relocalized to regions enriched with H3K9me3 in wild-type strains. This resulted in many genome rearrangements and the formation of new chromosomes, accompanied by the activation of transposable elements. In contrast, the loss of H3K27me3 increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions, without large-scale changes in gene activity. The study suggests that H3K9me3 is crucial for maintaining genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. The findings provide a basis for future studies on the influence of heterochromatin on structural genome rearrangements using Z. tritici as a model organism.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination strategies for rabies in low-income countries. They found that PEP vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention, with a cost of $200 to less than $60 per death averted. The study compared intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) administration of PEP and found that switching to ID regimens could significantly reduce costs and mitigate vaccine shortages. ID administration requires less vaccine volume to treat the same number of patients, making it a more economical option for healthcare providers.

The researchers also explored financing mechanisms to make PEP more accessible and affordable for those in need. They suggest that a universal switch to ID delivery could improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP, leading to a reduction in human rabies deaths. The study highlights the importance of increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in the delivery of PEP, particularly in low-income countries where the burden of rabies is highest.

The researchers analyzed the costs of IM versus ID administration of PEP in different settings and under realistic constraints, such as poor compliance. They found that ID delivery of PEP is more cost-effective than IM delivery in terms of averting rabies cases and saving lives. The study also emphasizes the need to consider clinic throughput and vial sharing when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of ID administration relative to IM.
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite that infects mammalian cells, has developed a mechanism to acquire nutrients by attracting host organelles to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where it replicates. Research has shown that Toxoplasma exploits host lipid droplets (LD), which are fat storage organelles, to obtain lipids. The study found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD or impaired in lipid metabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of genes associated with LD increase, and the PV is surrounded by host LD. Toxoplasma can access lipids stored in host LD and incorporate them into its own membranes and LD. The parasite can also intercept and internalize host LD within the PV, which are then wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation have a reduced capacity to take up lipids from host LD. Additionally, parasites lacking a phospholipase A2 enzyme in the IVN are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD. The study highlights Toxoplasma's reliance on host LD for its intracellular development and its ability to scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.
Researchers have identified chalcones, a type of flavonoid, as potential inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica, a liver fluke parasite that causes fasciolosis in cattle and sheep. Fasciolosis is an emerging zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, and chemotherapy is currently the main control measure available. However, resistance to the commonly used drug triclabendazole has been reported in several countries, making it essential to find new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections.

A library of 40 flavonoid derivatives was screened for inhibitors of key stage-specific Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases, FhCL3 and FhCL1. Chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups emerged as effective cathepsin L inhibitors, with one compound, C34, showing a strong binding affinity to juvenile-specific FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 was found to be a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues, determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases.

In vitro studies showed that C34 reduced the ability of the parasite to migrate through the gut wall and caused a loss of motility, leading to parasite death within a week. Importantly, C34 was not cytotoxic to bovine cells, making it a promising candidate for further development as a novel agent to control fluke infection. These findings open new avenues for the development of innovative drugs to treat fasciolosis and potentially other helminthic diseases.
Researchers investigated how the visual system transmits information about changes in light intensity to the inner retina. They used in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells (BCs) transmit signals to the inner retina. The study found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is a key factor in filtering visual signals. BCs have multiple terminals of varying sizes, with smaller terminals transmitting faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals are more effective at transmitting higher stimulus frequencies.

The researchers used a calcium indicator to measure the presynaptic calcium signal in BCs and found that it is a strongly rectifying function of light intensity, causing a steady increase in calcium that is graded with contrast. Voltage-dependent calcium channels in the synaptic terminal of BCs are responsible for the first major non-linear transformation of the visual signal.

The study also found that variations in filtering of the presynaptic calcium signal impact the output from the synapse. Smaller terminals respond to a step of light with higher relative release rates, but the resolution of this reporter was too low to detect modulations at stimulus frequencies above 1 Hz. The researchers used an "Adaptation Index" to quantify time-dependent changes in synaptic gain and found that the rate of vesicle release depresses more profoundly in smaller terminals.

The study's findings suggest that one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.
Researchers have developed a new method for detecting and analyzing individual synapses in the brain using fluorescence microscopy. Synapses are the connections between neurons that allow them to communicate with each other, and understanding their structure and function is crucial for understanding brain function and disease. Current methods for detecting synapses, such as electron microscopy, are time-consuming and expensive, while fluorescence microscopy offers high-speed and low-cost analysis but struggles to distinguish between synaptic and non-synaptic signals.

The new method, called probabilistic fluorescence-based synapse detection, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze fluorescence microscopy images and identify synapses with high accuracy. The method was tested using data from a technique called conjugate array tomography, which provides both fluorescence and electron microscopy images of the same synapses. The results showed that the new method was able to detect synapses as accurately as human annotators, and reproduced known features of cortical synapse distributions.

This new method has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience by allowing researchers to analyze large numbers of synapses quickly and accurately. It could also be used to identify new types of synapses and their density, and to study the relationships between synapses and their parent neurons. The method may also be useful for analyzing standard confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images, which are widely available but difficult to analyze using current methods. Overall, the new method provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex networks of synapses in the brain.
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, and immune system function. Impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. In mammals, zinc transport occurs through two families of transporters: ZnT and ZIP. ZnT2, a member of the ZnT family, is responsible for accumulating zinc in vesicles and secreting it into breast milk during lactation. However, the mechanism of action of ZnT2 is not well understood.

Research has suggested that ZnT2 may be coupled to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles, but this has not been conclusively established. To investigate this, the researchers modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 using computational and experimental methods. They found that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, meaning it transports zinc into vesicles in exchange for protons. This was demonstrated using functional zinc transport assays and inhibitors of the vacuolar-type proton ATPase, which alkalizes acidic vesicles.

The researchers also showed that overexpression of ZnT2 in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc led to alkalization of the vesicular pH, which was reversed by a zinc chelator. Computational energy calculations suggested that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ions. This means that ZnT2 concentrates zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study provides evidence that ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger.
Researchers have discovered that 14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by regulating the activity of Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) during DNA replication. Exo1 is an enzyme that processes stalled replication forks, which are essential for the integrity of the genome. The study found that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Exo1 in both yeast and mammalian cells, and that they help control the phosphorylation status of Exo1. Phosphorylation of Exo1 restrains its activity, and the absence of 14-3-3 proteins leads to unchecked Exo1 activity, resulting in the accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps at stalled forks. This, in turn, causes persistent checkpoint activation and impaired recovery from DNA replication stress. The researchers also found that 14-3-3 proteins promote the progression and stability of replication forks, particularly under conditions of limited nucleotide availability. They propose that 14-3-3 proteins act as a platform for controlling Exo1 phosphorylation and activity, ensuring the proper processing of stalled replication forks. The study sheds light on the complex processes occurring at stalled replication forks and highlights the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability. Further research is needed to identify additional targets of 14-3-3 proteins and to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which they regulate Exo1 activity.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes pDC in lymphoid organs, allowing them to study the effects of pDC depletion on HIV-1 infection. The study found that pDC play a dual role in HIV-1 infection: they suppress HIV-1 replication by producing type I interferons (IFN-I), but also contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells.

During acute HIV-1 infection, pDC depletion abolished the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to increased HIV-1 replication. However, cell death induced by a highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was reduced in pDC-depleted mice. In chronic HIV-1 infection, pDC depletion also reduced IFN-I and ISG induction, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Notably, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells in lymphoid organs was reduced in pDC-depleted mice, despite increased viral replication.

These findings suggest that pDC play a complex role in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis, and that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1-infected patients with persistent immune activation despite effective antiretroviral therapy. The study highlights the importance of understanding the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and the potential benefits of targeting pDC in HIV-1 treatment.
Sulforaphane, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in primary macrophages. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the body's defense against pathogens. The study found that sulforaphane blocks HIV infection in macrophages, but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This suggests that sulforaphane's anti-viral effects are specific to macrophages.

The researchers discovered that sulforaphane's anti-viral activity is mediated through the transcription regulator nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a protein that regulates the expression of anti-oxidant genes. When sulforaphane is present, it mobilizes Nrf2, which in turn blocks HIV infection. The study found that depleting Nrf2 with siRNA increased HIV infectivity in macrophages, suggesting that Nrf2 is essential for sulforaphane's anti-viral effects.

The researchers also found that sulforaphane blocks HIV infection after reverse transcription, but before the formation of 2-LTR circles. This is similar to the mechanism of other anti-viral proteins, such as SAMHD1 and MX2, which are induced by type I interferon. However, unlike these proteins, sulforaphane does not upregulate SAMHD1 or MX2. This suggests that sulforaphane's anti-viral activity is a novel mechanism that is distinct from other known anti-viral pathways. Overall, the study provides new insights into the anti-viral effects of sulforaphane and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent against HIV infection.
A cross-sectional study conducted in rural western Kenya investigated the prevalence and risk factors of geohelminth infections among pregnant women. The study found that 76.2% of the 390 participants who provided a stool sample were infected with at least one geohelminth species, with Ascaris lumbricoides being the most prevalent (52.3%), followed by hookworm (39.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (29.0%). Geohelminth infections were associated with the use of an unprotected water source and the lack of treatment of drinking water, but not with clinical symptoms or low body mass index.

The study also found that hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference, and hookworm infections with an egg count of 1000 or more per gram of feces were linked to lower hemoglobin levels. However, geohelminth infections were not found to have a significant impact on symptoms, anemia, or nutritional status in this population.

Interestingly, the study found that women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia compared to women without Ascaris lumbricoides, particularly among those in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. The study suggests that routine provision of antihelminth treatment during antenatal clinic visits may be beneficial, but further evaluation of the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcomes is needed.
Mycolactone, a compound produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. Researchers investigated whether mycolactone affects the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which are involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance. The study found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells without affecting their viability. This effect was observed in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the in vivo study, mycolactone was injected into the spinal canal of rats with neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. The results showed that mycolactone decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity. The study suggests that mycolactone's anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to its analgesic effects. Mycolactone has previously been shown to block the Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, which may also contribute to its analgesic effects. The findings of this study provide evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, and support the idea that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may be partially explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
Researchers studied the genetic factors that influence the outcome of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a deadly disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The study focused on populations in Guinea, where HAT has varying clinical outcomes, ranging from rapid progression to spontaneous self-cure. The researchers analyzed genetic variations in 28 genes from 425 individuals, including 232 HAT cases, 79 individuals with latent infections, and 114 healthy controls.

The study found associations between certain genetic variations and HAT outcomes. The IL6 rs1818879 allele A was linked to a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. In contrast, the MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele were associated with an increased risk of latent infections. The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was linked to a higher risk of developing HAT, while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk.

These findings suggest that host genetic factors play a role in modulating the outcome of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in individuals from Guinea. The study contributes to the understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of new control tools for HAT. The research is part of the TrypanoGEN project, which aims to investigate the genetic basis of human susceptibility to trypanosomiasis.
Researchers conducted deep whole-genome sequencing on 38 individuals from the general population of Singapore, who are primarily descendants of immigrants from Dravidian-language-speaking states in south India. The study, part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP), aimed to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore. The results showed that the SSIP samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio compared to other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Asian Indians, the genetic makeup of the SSIP samples was found to be closely related to South Indians. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and showed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of the relative relatedness between SSIP samples and archaic hominins (Denisovan and Neanderthal) revealed higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations than in SSIP samples. The study's data resource is now publicly available and is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of the 1,000 Genomes Project.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of rare aminoglycoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudomallei clinical isolates from Thailand. Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial infections. However, most B. pseudomallei strains are resistant to these antibiotics due to the expression of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. The study focused on three Thai strains, 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, which exhibited aminoglycoside susceptibility. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that strain 708a lacked amrB transcripts, while strains 2188a and 3799a had greatly reduced levels. Serial passage on increasing gentamicin concentrations led to the emergence of mutants in strains 2188a and 3799a, which became resistant to other aminoglycosides and macrolides. Transcript analysis showed that this resistance was due to the upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression. In contrast, mutants could not be obtained from strain 708a. Further analysis revealed that the amrAB-oprA operon was missing in strain 708a due to a large chromosome 1 deletion. This deletion also removed genes involved in malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis, as well as the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway and putative type 1 fimbriae and secreted chitinase. Despite missing these genes, strain 708a remained fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. The study suggests that strain 708a may be a suitable candidate for genetic manipulation experiments using Select Agent compliant antibiotics.
Researchers studied how CD4 T helper cells, a type of immune cell, differentiate into two distinct types: Th1 and Th2 cells. These cells play a crucial role in the immune system, with Th1 cells helping to fight off infections and Th2 cells involved in allergic reactions. Traditionally, it was thought that the differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th1 or Th2 cells was an all-or-nothing process, where cells expressed either Th1 or Th2 markers, but not both. However, this study found that in the early stages of differentiation, CD4 T cells can express both Th1 and Th2 markers simultaneously, a phenomenon known as a mixed Th1/Th2 state. This mixed state is characterized by the co-expression of transcription factors, such as Tbx21 and Gata3, which are typically associated with Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. The study also found that cytokines, which are signaling molecules that influence cell behavior, are expressed in a small subpopulation of cells and are not correlated with the expression of transcription factors in individual cells. When cytokine signaling was inhibited, the classic mutual exclusion of Th1 and Th2 markers was observed, revealing a complex interplay between extracellular cytokines and intracellular transcription factors. These findings suggest that CD4 T cells can acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state in response to extracellular cytokines, and that this mixed state may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
Researchers have identified a protein called PAQR-2 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) that plays a crucial role in adapting to cold temperatures. PAQR-2 is similar to insulin-sensitizing receptors found in mammals and is essential for the worm's growth at temperatures around 15°C. To understand how PAQR-2 functions, the researchers screened for genetic mutations that suppress its activity and found several genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. These genes include cept-1, pcyt-1, sams-1, ech-7, hacd-1, mdt-15, nhr-49, and sbp-1.

The study found that PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1, and Δ9-desaturases form a pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This pathway is essential for the worm's adaptation to cold temperatures. The researchers observed that mutations in PAQR-2 suppressors normalize the levels of saturated fatty acids, and that low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue the PAQR-2 mutant. This suggests that PAQR-2 regulates the activity of Δ9-desaturases, enzymes that convert saturated fatty acids into unsaturated ones, to maintain membrane fluidity during cold adaptation. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in C. elegans and highlights the importance of PAQR-2 in regulating fatty acid metabolism.
Researchers have used electron cryo-tomography to study the structure of human herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions, revealing a previously unknown feature at the portal vertex. This feature extends from the capsid to the viral membrane, forming a connection between the two. The location of this assembly suggests it plays a role in releasing the viral genome into the host cell's nucleus and is also important for the overall structure of the virion.

The discovery was made by comparing the structure of HSV-1 with that of tailed bacteriophages, which share a common evolutionary origin with herpesviruses. Tailed bacteriophages have a complex apparatus at the portal vertex that helps deliver the viral genome into the host cell. The similarity in structure between HSV-1 and tailed bacteriophages suggests that HSV-1 may have a similar mechanism for releasing its genome.

HSV-1 is a well-characterized virus that causes a range of diseases, including cold sores and cancer. The virus has a unique structure, consisting of a capsid, a proteinaceous layer called the tegument, and a lipid envelope. The capsid is made up of pentons, hexons, and triplexes, which form the icosahedral shape of the virus. The discovery of the new feature at the portal vertex provides new insights into the structure and function of HSV-1 and may help researchers understand how the virus interacts with host cells.
Researchers investigated the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 (rω-1) on HIV-1 infection in vitro. They found that SEA and rω-1 can modulate CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and reduce the susceptibility of T-cells to HIV-1 infection. Specifically, SEA blocked DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 trans-infection by binding to kappa-5, a component of SEA. Additionally, DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2-promoting conditions induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X4 infection. This effect was not observed when DCs were exposed to SEA under Th1 or Th1/Th2 (Tmix) promoting conditions. Both SEA-exposed DCs and rω-1-exposed DCs induced T-cells with reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. Furthermore, the infection profile of T-cells infected with HIV-1 R5 was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 cell surface expression. However, rω-1-exposed DCs under Tmix conditions induced T-cells with reduced CCR5 expression, which correlated with reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 R5 infection. These findings suggest that SEA and rω-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity and may influence disease course in co-infected individuals.
Researchers have identified a phenomenon where neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in both grey and white matter. Despite its potential implications for understanding basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A new dynamic model has been developed to explain the ECS shrinkage phenomenon in both wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that several factors contribute to ECS shrinkage, including the release of potassium and uptake of sodium by neurons, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, the action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven water transport through the astrocyte membrane. However, the model also indicates that the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl− (NKCC1) and Na+/HCO3− (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving the observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. The model provides a detailed and constrained framework that can guide future experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive models of astroglia-neuron interactions in both normal and pathophysiological situations. To further validate the model, researchers recommend measuring ECS shrinkage, membrane potential, and ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations in wild-type and knockout individuals, as well as obtaining data on neuronal water, sodium, and chloride uptake during activation.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism for silencing transposons and repetitive DNA elements in eukaryotic genomes. These elements, if transcribed, can be detrimental to the organism. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species, the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway suppresses their expression. This pathway involves long non-coding RNAs produced by RNA Polymerase V guiding ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) to chromatin and attracting enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications.

The study found that SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing. This binding occurs downstream of RNA Polymerase V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. Additionally, SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other.

The researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to show that binding of both AGO4 and SPT5L/KTF1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of several loci. The study proposes that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for the direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes.

The findings suggest that SPT5L contributes to the regulation of siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing in a highly locus-specific manner. While SPT5L is not required for AGO4 recruitment to chromatin, it enhances AGO4 chromatin binding. The study resolves the mechanism of siRNA-mediated recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes to chromatin and the function of SPT5L in this process.
Researchers have investigated the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, from ticks to mammals. The study found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. In the absence of RpoS, the bacteria are confined to the midgut lumen and transform into an unusual morphotype, known as round bodies, during the later stages of the blood meal. This transformation is reversible and appears to be linked to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, an enzyme that provides energy for glycolysis. The study suggests that the bacteria default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when they sense that the energy required for transmission is unfavorable. The research highlights the importance of RpoS in the tick-phase of the enzootic cycle and reveals a previously unsuspected role for RpoSBb in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission. The study also identifies a proposed default survival mode, round body formation, triggered when spirochetes are unable to produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between Borrelia burgdorferi and its tick vector, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the transmission of Lyme disease.
Plant hormones gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) play crucial roles in regulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. A deficiency in GA causes male sterility due to the accumulation of DELLA proteins, while a deficiency in JA also leads to male sterility. However, the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development was not well understood. Researchers found that three MYB genes, MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, are GA-dependent and stamen-enriched genes. Loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restored the expression of these three MYB genes and stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis showed that a triple mutant of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 resulted in a short stamen phenotype and male sterility. Further studies revealed that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, leading to increased JA content in young flower buds. The researchers concluded that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, establishing a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in regulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. The findings suggest that modulation of the JA pathway by GA is a prerequisite for normal stamen development.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in modulating lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that a deletion mutant of hif-1 showed significant lifespan extension in C. elegans, suggesting that HIF-1 plays a role in regulating lifespan. Genetic epistasis experiments indicated that HIF-1 functions downstream of the nutrient-responsive TOR-S6K pathway to modulate lifespan. Using a modified DR regime, the researchers found that HIF-1 is involved in DR-mediated lifespan regulation, with overexpression of HIF-1 diminishing lifespan extension under DR. They also found that HIF-1 acts downstream of the nutrient-responsive TOR-S6K pathway, as egl-9 animals with elevated HIF-1 showed diminished lifespan extension both under DR and by a mutation in S6K. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that HIF-1-dependent lifespan extension is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. These findings suggest that HIF-1 plays a tissue-specific role in the lifespan extension by DR involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DR-mediated lifespan extension and highlights the importance of HIF-1 in regulating lifespan in C. elegans.
Researchers have discovered that human skin cells called epidermal keratinocytes undergo significant changes in their genetic material as they transition between different functional states, such as differentiation and migration. These changes involve the formation of unique groups of genetic elements called enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. The study found that a transcription factor called GRHL3 plays a crucial role in regulating these changes by binding to different parts of the genetic material in each state. In differentiating keratinocytes, GRHL3 binds to super-enhancers that are linked to genes involved in differentiation, while in migrating keratinocytes, it binds to promoters that repress the expression of genes that inhibit migration. The researchers also found that GRHL3 is essential for normal keratinocyte migration during eyelid closure and wound healing, and that it modulates gene expression programs that promote cell movement. The study suggests that GRHL3 can promote both differentiation and migration of keratinocytes through distinct mechanisms, and that its binding to different parts of the genetic material is critical for regulating these processes. The findings provide new insights into how a single transcription factor can control different gene expression programs in the same cell type, and have implications for our understanding of skin development and disease.
Researchers studied the relationship between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that are passed down from generation to generation. The study found that some ERVs can block the replication of related exogenous retroviruses, suggesting that they may be used by the host as a defense mechanism. The researchers isolated and characterized 27 ERVs in sheep, known as enJSRVs, which have been integrated into the host genome for the past 5-7 million years. Two of these ERVs, enJSRV-56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein that allows them to block the replication of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around the time of sheep domestication, approximately 9,000 years ago. However, a new provirus that escapes the transdominant ERVs has emerged recently, likely within the last 200 years. This suggests that the evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses is a continuous process. The study provides evidence that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. The findings offer a unique insight into the complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses during host evolution.
Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for diagnosing imported schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays, but these methods have low sensitivity. The study aimed to assess the performance of two in-house Schistosoma PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium in excreta, biopsies, and sera for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy.

The researchers analyzed 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis, including urine, stool, biopsy, and serum samples, before treatment. The results were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination (HA), and Western Blot (WB) assay. The PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis, from 4% to 10.5% and from 33.7% to 48.8%, for S. haematobium in urine and S. mansoni in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta (microscopy). The specificity of serum PCR was 98.9%.

After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, while antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The study suggests that Schistosoma PCRs outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology. Serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration when serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative.
Researchers have developed a machine learning approach to estimate the energy of complex molecules, such as the natural product Archazolid A, which is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase. This method uses Gaussian process regression to predict the energy of new conformations of the molecule based on information from previous calculations. The approach allows for a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up, with mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol achieved for energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory.

The study demonstrates that machine learning models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling significant speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures. The researchers used a simple molecular representation that proved sensitive to structural variations in relaxed geometries and enabled finding correlations between simulated conformations and computed energy values.

This approach is based on a Bayesian non-parametric machine learning method called GP regression, which has been used in cheminformatics to estimate experimentally determined molecular properties. The researchers trained machine learning models to capture the relationship between relaxed Archazolid A conformations and their DFT-D3 energies, using a simple matrix representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances. The results show that this approach can be used to estimate the energy of complex molecules with high accuracy, paving the way for long-term simulations of challenging chemical and biomolecular systems.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect ebolavirus antibodies in wild great apes using non-invasive fecal samples. This approach allows for the monitoring of ebolavirus infections in wild ape populations, which is crucial for understanding the impact of the virus on these animals. The study found that 10% of gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DCO) region tested positive for ebolavirus antibodies, indicating that exposure to the virus is not uniformly lethal in this species. The researchers also detected antibodies in gorillas that were previously thought to be unexposed to ebolavirus, suggesting that the virus may be more widespread than previously thought.

This new method has significant implications for the management and survival of wild great apes. It will enable the early detection of increased incidence of ebolavirus exposure, identification of immunologically naïve at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking of vaccine efficacy if vaccination is deemed necessary. The study's findings also have important public health implications, as human ebolavirus disease (EVD) is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, and efforts to identify great ape outbreaks could have a significant impact on public health in local communities.

The researchers used a non-invasive immunological assay to detect ebolavirus antibodies in fecal samples, allowing for the examination of ebolavirus exposure in wild great apes without causing harm to the animals. This approach has the potential to be valuable in the development and implementation of prospective epidemiological ebolavirus studies in wild great ape populations.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector protein, XopL, from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which causes disease in tomato and pepper plants. This protein exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, a function typically found in eukaryotic cells. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of XopL is associated with its C-terminal region, which specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates the formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, which is not present in any previously characterized E3 ligases. Mutations in the central cavity of the XL-box disrupt E3 ligase activity and prevent XopL-induced plant cell death. The N-terminal region of XopL contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein interaction module for ubiquitination target recognition. The E3 ligase activity of XopL is required to provoke plant cell death, while the N-terminal LRR domain is sufficient to suppress PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) responses. The unique structural fold of the XopL E3 ubiquitin ligase domain highlights the variation in bacterial pathogen effectors that mimic eukaryote-specific activities. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens manipulate host cell processes and highlights the diversity of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolved in pathogenic bacteria.
Researchers studied the interaction between T follicular helper cells (cTfh) and B cells in individuals with early and late acute HIV infection. They found that cTfh function was impaired in individuals treated in the late stage of acute infection compared to those treated in the early stage. This impairment was associated with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion, as well as increased inflammation. Elevated plasma viral load in the late stage was linked to decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, suggesting a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment.

Phenotypic changes were also observed in the mature B cell compartment, with a decrease in resting memory B cells in the late stage compared to the early stage, coinciding with higher viremia. Coculture assays suggested that intrinsic memory B cell defects could contribute to the impaired response. The study found that cTfh-mediated B cell responses were significantly altered in the late stage compared to the early stage, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells.

These findings suggest that early antiretroviral treatment (ART) for acutely HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory. The study used the RV254 cohort of HIV-infected individuals to investigate T helper-B cell responses in acute HIV infection and the impact of early ART on T and B cell function. The results indicate that identifying individuals very early on during HIV infection has the potential to preserve cTfh-dependent B cell responses.
Researchers have identified a new target for developing more effective treatments against schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, has several limitations, making it essential to find new anthelmintics. To achieve this, the researchers focused on a specific type of receptor called a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. This receptor, called Sm.5HTR, is involved in the parasite's response to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the parasite's survival.

The researchers developed a miniaturized screening assay to test the activity of various compounds on Sm.5HTR. This assay allowed them to identify new ligands that selectively bind to Sm.5HTR, but not to its human homolog, Hs.5HTR7. These new ligands showed promise in killing schistosomules and adult worms in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that Sm.5HTR has a unique property called irreversible inactivation, which makes it an attractive target for developing new anthelmintics.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high-throughput screening format and highlights the potential of Sm.5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for the development of next-generation anthelmintics. The findings suggest that targeting Sm.5HTR could lead to the development of more effective and selective treatments against schistosomiasis.
During embryonic development, the formation of the germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. Researchers have long believed that differences in cell adhesion between these layers were sufficient to maintain their integrity and prevent intermixing. However, new evidence suggests that localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary between the ectoderm and mesoderm is key to their segregation. This process involves an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum. The ephrinB/EphB signaling pathway plays a central role in this process, with multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors expressed on each side of the boundary. Forward signaling across the boundary, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors, activates Rac and RhoA, which modulate cytoskeletal dynamics. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process, as it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary. In contrast to previous theories, such as Steinberg's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, which posits that simple adhesion differences between cell populations are sufficient for their separation, this new evidence suggests that specialized tissue separation mechanisms are required when the boundary between two germ layers also serves for tissue translocation. The ephrinB/EphB mechanism of tissue separation has been observed in various organisms, including flies, fish, and amphibians, and may be conserved in other species, such as zebrafish and Drosophila.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify potential biomarkers for the condition. The study focused on metabolites related to the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways. Using advanced statistical analysis, the researchers were able to correctly classify 96.1% of the neurotypical participants and 97.6% of the ASD cohort. This level of accuracy is significantly higher than previous approaches in the field.

The researchers also used the data to predict adaptive behavior in children with ASD, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score. By analyzing five specific metabolites, they were able to predict the Vineland score with an R-squared value of 0.45 after cross-validation. This indicates a strong correlation between the metabolites and ASD diagnosis, as well as the potential of the statistical analysis to extract important information from complex biochemical data sets.

The study's findings suggest that biochemical data could be used to support behavioral diagnoses of ASD, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. The researchers used a combination of Fisher Discriminant Analysis and kernel partial least squares to analyze the data, which allowed them to extract important information from the complex biochemical data sets. The study's results have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of ASD and may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools.
Researchers analyzed leishmaniasis incidence data in Brazil from 2001 to 2010 using Bayesian geostatistical models. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a parasite that affects 98 countries, with 350 million people at risk and 2 million cases annually. The study focused on cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, which are the two main forms of the disease. The researchers used statistical models to identify the most important environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the spread of the disease. They found that precipitation and socioeconomic factors were significant risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis.

The study produced high-resolution maps of leishmaniasis incidence in Brazil, highlighting areas with the highest numbers of infected people. The maps showed that the states of Minas Gerais and Pará had the highest numbers of infected people for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The researchers estimated that there were approximately 30,189 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 cases of visceral leishmaniasis in 2010. The study's findings suggest that targeting control efforts in these high-risk areas could help reduce the incidence of leishmaniasis. The researchers used a statistical approach called Bayesian variable selection to identify the most important factors contributing to the spread of the disease. This approach allowed them to produce accurate and detailed maps of leishmaniasis incidence in Brazil.
Researchers in Vietnam studied the clinical features of dengue fever in 1,528 patients, including 647 adults and 881 children, who were hospitalized at a single hospital in southern Vietnam. The study aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes of dengue in adults and children. The results showed that children experienced more severe signs of vascular leakage and shock, while adults had more bleeding manifestations and organ involvement. Additionally, adults had significantly lower platelet counts, a condition known as thrombocytopenia, than children.

The study found that secondary infection, but not the type of dengue virus, was associated with more severe thrombocytopenia. However, the effect of age on platelet count was more significant than the effect of secondary infection. Furthermore, the researchers observed that healthy adults had intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children, even several weeks after recovery from the disease.

The findings suggest that there are distinct differences in the pattern of complications seen in dengue infection between adults and children, which are partly due to age-dependent physiological differences. The study highlights the importance of considering these differences in the development of management guidelines and research on disease pathogenesis. The results also emphasize the need for further research on the use of blood products, such as platelet transfusions, in the treatment of dengue fever, particularly in adults.
Researchers have discovered a novel mutation in the CCR5 gene of sooty mangabeys, a natural host of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVsmm). This mutation, known as CCR5Δ2, results in a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIVsmm entry in vitro. The mutation is present in 26% of a large sooty mangabey colony, with 8% of animals being homozygous for the defective allele and 41% being heterozygous. Notably, the prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to those with wild-type CCR5. Furthermore, animals without functional CCR5 had robust plasma viral loads, which were only modestly lower than those of wild-type animals. In vitro experiments showed that SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a CCR5-independent manner. The virus also used alternative coreceptors such as CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1 in addition to CCR5 in transfected cells. These findings suggest that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in sooty mangabeys, which may enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of restricted CCR5 expression. This raises the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells.
Researchers have shed light on the complex role of MEF2, a transcription factor involved in the development of leiomyosarcomas (LMS), a rare and aggressive type of soft tissue cancer. Contrary to previous assumptions, MEF2 can have both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities, depending on its interactions with co-activators or co-repressors. This dual function allows MEF2 to regulate histone modifications associated with gene activation and repression, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation.

The study found that class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC9, play a critical role in converting MEF2 into a transcriptional repressor in LMS. High levels of MEF2 and class IIa HDACs are associated with poor patient outcomes, and the knockout of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells by restoring the transcriptional activity of some MEF2-target genes. The researchers also discovered that class IIa HDACs do not bind to all regulatory elements bound by MEF2, allowing for the coexistence of actively transcribed and strongly repressed MEF2-target genes.

The study suggests that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are potential therapeutic targets for LMS treatment. The findings have implications for understanding the complex role of MEF2 in cancer development and may lead to the development of new treatments for this aggressive type of cancer.
Researchers have used a combination of techniques, including protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy, to study the structure of hydrophobin films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Hydrophobins are proteins that play a crucial role in how fungi interact with their environment and have potential applications in nanotechnology. The study aimed to gain a detailed understanding of the surface structure of hydrophobin films at the air-water interface.

The researchers found that the experimentally observed unit cell size for the 2-D crystal structure of the hydrophobins matches one of the lattice vectors of a close-packed arrangement of the proteins, suggesting a unit cell composed of six proteins. However, computational results indicate the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three-protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film was used to show how this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films.

The study's findings suggest that the unique macroscopic properties of hydrophobin films arise from cooperative effects in the stabilization of the film resulting from interactions between the interlocking proteins in the structured surface network. The research has implications for both biology and nanotechnology, highlighting the potential of hydrophobins as a model system for understanding self-assembly and surface interactions.
Researchers have identified Leishmania donovani threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) as a potential therapeutic target for treating visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite L. donovani. LdThrRS is an enzyme essential for protein synthesis in the parasite. The researchers expressed and purified recombinant LdThrRS (rLdThrRS) in E. coli and characterized its kinetic parameters. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that LdThrRS is localized in both the cytosol and mitochondria of L. donovani promastigotes.

Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in L. donovani promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and reduced infectivity. These mutants were also more susceptible to the ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. The researchers were unable to obtain homozygous null mutants of LdThrRS, indicating its essentiality for the parasite's survival. Borrelidin showed a strong affinity for LdThrRS, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.04 μM, and inhibited the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.06 μM. Borrelidin also inhibited the promastigote stage of L. donovani parasites with an IC50 of 21 μM.

The study suggests that LdThrRS is a promising target for antileishmanial drug discovery, as it is essential for the parasite's survival and can bind to small drug-like molecules with strong affinity. The researchers propose that targeting LdThrRS could lead to the development of new treatments for visceral leishmaniasis.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune system through the presence of a 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp) on the viral RNA in association with a 3′ poly-U/UC tract. Researchers have defined the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and the criteria for RIG-I non-self discrimination by examining the RNA structure-function attributes that impart PAMP function to the poly-U/UC tract. The study found that the 34 nucleotide poly-uridine "core" of this sequence tract was essential for RIG-I activation, and that interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences in the RNA were required to achieve optimal RIG-I signal induction. The poly-U/UC RNA variants that stimulated strong RIG-I activation efficiently bound purified RIG-I protein in vitro, and RNA interaction with both the repressor domain and helicase domain of RIG-I was required to activate signaling. When appended to 5′-ppp RNA that lacks PAMP activity, the poly-U/UC U-core sequence conferred non-self recognition of the RNA and innate immune signaling by RIG-I. Importantly, HCV poly-U/UC RNA variants that strongly activated RIG-I signaling triggered potent anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo using a mouse model of PAMP signaling. The study defines a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection.
Researchers have found that eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in the growth of a parasitic nematode, Trichinella spiralis, in the host's skeletal muscle. Eosinophils are traditionally known for their role in fighting infections and allergies, but this study reveals a new function: supporting the growth of parasites. The researchers discovered that eosinophils produce a protein called IL-4, which is necessary for the normal growth of the nematode larvae. They also found that eosinophils from mice that are capable of producing IL-4 are sufficient to support the growth of the larvae, even in the absence of an adaptive immune response. The study showed that the presence of eosinophils suppresses local inflammation and influences nutrient homeostasis in the muscle, allowing the larvae to grow. The researchers also found that eosinophils promote the uptake of glucose by the larvae, which is essential for their growth. The study suggests that the nematode has evolved a strategy to co-opt the host's innate immune response to facilitate its growth. The findings provide new insights into the complex interaction between the host and the parasite, and highlight the role of eosinophils in this process. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism by which eosinophils support the growth of the nematode larvae.
A recent study has challenged the long-held view that mammalian chromosomes consist of large domains of coordinated origin firing separated by originless transition regions. Using DNA combing in HeLa cells, researchers found that replication origins are spaced approximately 40 kilobases apart and fire in small clusters, with their synchrony increasing during the S phase of the cell cycle. The study also showed that replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed throughout the S phase, contradicting the idea of large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Instead, the data suggest that temporal transition regions are replicated by the sequential activation of origins at an increasing rate during the S phase. This process sets the replication timing gradients, which are not determined by the velocity of single forks but rather by the delay and spacing between successive origin firings. The study's findings were corroborated by analysis of published origin maps and replication timing data in other cell types, with the exception of embryonic stem cells, which exhibit more regions of unidirectional fork progression. The results provide new insights into the replication timing program of mammalian genomes and propose a general model for their replication kinetics, suggesting that origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure or that replication forks stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA.
Researchers investigated how the nervous system can efficiently recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting conditions. They proposed that this ability is learned by exploiting the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. The study explored how this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. The researchers first showed that slow feature analysis, an algorithm based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, another implementation of slowness learning. They then demonstrated that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window. The study found that the learning window alone is not sufficient to explain the outcome of STDP learning, but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is crucial. The researchers derived STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule" and found that these windows are compatible with physiological data in terms of shape and timescale. The study also showed that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT). This phenomenon occurs when cancer cells with different genetic and phenotypic characteristics interact with each other to develop resistance to chemotherapy. The study used a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer NSCLC cells with mutations in the Dicer1 gene, which is involved in the production of small non-coding RNAs. The researchers then monitored the growth of these cells in a three-dimensional culture system and found that when cells with different mutations were grown together, they were able to develop resistance to chemotherapy more quickly than cells grown alone.

The study used mathematical modeling and flow cytometry to analyze the growth patterns of the cells and found that the combination of wild-type and mutant cells in co-culture allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug-sensitive cells. This was due to a cooperative game-theoretic change in the fitness values of the cells. The researchers also used an ex vivo human tumor model to show that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates with prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples.

These findings suggest that profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy, as cancer cells can develop resistance through non-genetic cooperation. The study highlights the importance of understanding how tumor cells interact with each other to develop resistance to chemotherapy.
A study conducted in the Mbeya Region of Southwestern Tanzania found a high seroprevalence of Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae, with 67.9% of participants aged 5 and above testing positive for IgG antibodies against the bacteria. The study, which involved 1,228 participants, aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae and identify risk factors associated with the infection. The results showed that age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density were associated with higher seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae. In contrast, higher elevations were found to be associated with lower seroprevalence. The study also found that higher cattle density at higher elevations was linked to higher seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae. The findings suggest that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the rural population of the Mbeya Region and that temperature and elevation may limit the spread of the disease. The study's results are consistent with previous descriptions of SFG rickettsioses in Africa and highlight the need for further research to determine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses in the population. The study's findings also suggest that the brown dog tick, Rh. sanguineus, may be the primary vector for SFG rickettsiae in the region.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, is necessary for the activation of immune defense genes in response to pathogen infection. The researchers identified two enzymes responsible for synthesizing oleate in C. elegans and showed that animals deficient in oleate production are more susceptible to infection with various human pathogens. However, the addition of exogenous oleate can rescue this susceptibility, indicating that oleate plays a key role in innate immunity.

The study also found that oleate acts independently of other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, which have previously been shown to be important for innate immunity in C. elegans. The researchers demonstrated that oleate is necessary for the activation of immune responses against specific bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Serratia marcescens.

Interestingly, the study found that oleate supplementation can rescue the immune activation defect in C. elegans mutants that are unable to produce oleate, suggesting that oleate is sufficient to drive protective immune activation. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the importance of oleate in innate immunity and suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Researchers have identified a novel compound, PC1, that selectively inhibits the growth of certain bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens, by targeting guanine riboswitches. Guanine riboswitches are regulatory elements that control the expression of genes involved in purine metabolism. When guanine binds to these riboswitches, it stabilizes a specific mRNA structure, leading to the repression of downstream gene expression. The researchers designed PC1 to bind to guanine riboswitches, mimicking the effect of guanine itself. They found that PC1 exhibited bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of community-acquired infections. This activity was only observed when the bacteria used a guanine riboswitch to control the expression of the guaA gene, a key enzyme in purine metabolism. The researchers also demonstrated that PC1 reduced the severity of Staphylococcus aureus infections in a mouse model. This study provides a proof-of-concept for designing novel antibiotics that target guanine riboswitches, which could be effective against bacteria that have developed resistance to existing antibiotics. The discovery of PC1 and its mechanism of action highlights the potential of riboswitch-targeting compounds as a new class of antimicrobial agents.
Researchers studied how macaque monkeys navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward. They found that cells in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in spatial memory, respond to a monkey's gaze, head direction, and task context. These cells are similar to "place cells" found in rodents, but in primates, they also take into account the target of the monkey's gaze. This means that the cells encode not only the monkey's position in space but also its relationship to visual landmarks and the actions needed to reach a goal.

The study suggests that the hippocampus in primates represents space in a more complex way than previously thought, taking into account multiple variables such as position, view, and action context. This is in line with previous findings in rodents and humans, which showed that hippocampal cells encode spatial views, places, or a combination of both. The researchers used a controlled virtual reality setting to examine how cells in the hippocampus respond to different variables during navigation.

The study's findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how hippocampal cells code for space in primates, bridging the gap between research in rodents and primates, including humans. The results suggest that the counterpart of place cells in primates is expressed as activity related to the point of gaze in conjunction with other variables essential to navigation, such as position and identity of visual elements at key instants of trajectory planning.
Researchers have studied the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in vertebrate development, a region characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression. This pattern is maintained by a regulatory network between several transcription and secreted factors, but the details of this network were not fully understood. A new study used a Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns at the MHB in mice to identify key regulatory interactions in this network. The analysis predicted that Fgf8, a secreted factor, maintains Wnt1 expression, rather than inducing it. This prediction was experimentally confirmed using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures. The study also constructed a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB, including Otx2, Gbx2, Fgf8, Wnt1, En, and Pax. This network was analyzed using Boolean, differential equation, and reaction-diffusion models, which confirmed its ability to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB and the time-courses of expression patterns under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks, similar to temporal expression patterns. The findings provide new insights into the maintenance of the MHB on a systems level and clarify epistatic relationships between key patterning molecules, such as Fgf8 and Wnt1.
Theileria annulata, an apicomplexan parasite, transforms infected host cells by inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized cell population. The parasite develops into a schizont, which remains tethered to host cell microtubules (MTs) and engages with the cell's astral and central spindle MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis to secure its distribution between the two daughter cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which the schizont recruits and stabilizes host cell MTs is not known.

Research has shown that the plus ends of growing MTs provide the first point of contact with the parasite, and the end-binding protein 1 (EB1) is a central component of the MT plus end protein interaction network and a key regulator of host cell MT dynamics. The study found that T. annulata p104, a polymorphic antigen expressed on the schizont surface, functions as a genuine EB1-binding protein and can recruit EB1 in the absence of any other parasite proteins. The binding strictly depends on a consensus SxIP motif located in a highly disordered C-terminal region of p104.

The interaction between the schizont and host cell EB1 is cell cycle regulated, and this is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein to interact with EB1 via a bona-fide SxIP motif. The findings provide new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the persistence of the parasite in its transformed host.
Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that helps protect the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres, from damage. Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with neighboring chromosomes. When DNA replication is disrupted, broken replication forks can occur, leading to DNA breaks. Normally, these breaks are repaired through a process called homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR).

In a study using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers found that a mutation in the Cdc9 gene, which is involved in DNA replication, led to a population of cells with persistent DNA damage and longer telomeres. Further investigation revealed that this telomere lengthening was dependent on the presence of telomerase, a protein that extends telomeres, and the BIR repair pathway.

The researchers also found that the protein Pif1 plays a crucial role in this process. Pif1 is normally involved in inhibiting telomerase at double-strand breaks, but in the presence of DNA damage, it is phosphorylated, or modified, by the DNA damage signaling cascade. This phosphorylation of Pif1 is necessary for its function in BIR and telomere elongation.

The study suggests that the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity, leading to telomere lengthening. This mechanism may provide an additional layer of protection against DNA damage and telomere shortening. The researchers propose that this mechanism may also explain previous observations of telomere lengthening in other yeast mutants that suffer from replication fork pausing and breakage.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool for onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The tool, called luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), uses a mixture of four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1) to detect antibodies in patient sera. The LIPS assay was tested on a large cohort of sera from patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections. The results showed that the four-antigen LIPS assay had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The assay was also able to differentiate between Onchocerca volvulus and other filarial infections, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The simplified method of using a mixture of the four Onchocerca volvulus antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format (QLIPS) showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool for diagnosing individual Onchocerca volvulus infections and for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus infection.
A 54-month iron-folic acid and de-worming program was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. The program involved weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming. The study found that after 54 months, 76% of participants were taking the iron-folic acid supplement and 95% had taken the most recent deworming treatment. The mean hemoglobin level increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, and anemia prevalence decreased from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. These results indicate that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections, maintaining them below the level of public health concern.
Researchers have identified a novel immune evasion mechanism used by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to avoid detection by the immune system. The virus produces a protein called gp150, which is heavily glycosylated and forms a shield on the surface of infected cells. This shield impedes the presentation of antigens to T cells and other immune cells, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and eliminate the virus.

The study found that gp150 inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d molecules, which are responsible for presenting antigens to T cells and other immune cells. The mechanism of gp150-mediated immune evasion does not depend on the degradation of these molecules or the presence of a cytoplasmic tail. Instead, the glycosylation of gp150 creates a physical barrier that prevents the presentation of antigens on the surface of infected cells.

The researchers also found that B cells infected with a gp150-null mutant EBV displayed rescued levels of surface antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d, suggesting that iNKT cells play an important role in fighting EBV infection. The study provides new insights into the immune evasion strategies used by EBV and highlights the importance of iNKT cells in anti-EBV immunity.
The translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) plays a crucial role in the invasion of host cells by pathogenic chlamydial species. Tarp is a conserved protein among all pathogenic chlamydial species, and its ability to bind and nucleate actin is essential for bacterial entry. A peptide antiserum specific to the Tarp actin binding domain was generated and shown to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro and chlamydial entry in vivo. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from various chlamydial species revealed multiple putative actin binding sites, and GST-Tarp fusions from multiple species were found to bind and nucleate actin in vitro. These findings indicate that Tarp-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. Chlamydial species, including Caviae, C. muridarum, and various C. trachomatis serovars, harbor at least one and up to four functional actin binding domains, and purified recombinant Tarps from all species were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. The actin binding domain of Tarp appears to be essential for bacterial entry, as a peptide antiserum targeting this domain prevented Tarp-mediated actin nucleation and reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection. These results suggest that the actin nucleating activity of Tarp is required for C. trachomatis invasion.
Researchers have developed a new method for accurately quantifying Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces, a crucial step in understanding and controlling the spread of schistosomiasis japonica, a zoonotic disease. The formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique involves a series of steps, including filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation, to remove bulk debris and cellulose material from fecal samples. This allows for improved microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs, enabling accurate estimation of infection intensity and prevalence in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts.

The FEA-SD method was tested using fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and carabao in the Philippines, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and quantifying S. japonicum eggs. The technique was found to be as efficient as real-time PCR (qPCR) in determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement. The FEA-SD method is particularly valuable in areas with low to high infection intensity or where schistosomiasis japonica is suspected to have been eliminated following control efforts.

The new technique addresses a significant limitation of current microscopic methods, which are often hindered by the presence of cellulosic material in bovine feces. By removing this debris, the FEA-SD method provides a more accurate and reliable means of diagnosing schistosomiasis japonica in bovines and other ruminant hosts, making it a valuable tool for surveillance and control efforts.
Researchers have investigated the role of collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation in skeletal tissues. Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) were previously identified as causes of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin B, form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1(I) chain and has cis/trans isomerase activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for collagen structural stability, but its absence may disrupt protein-protein interactions and lead to collagen over-modification.

A novel mouse model, Lepre1H662A/H662A, was generated with a knock-in mutation in the catalytic domain of P3H1. This mutation inactivated the 3-hydroxylase activity of P3H1 and caused loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the collagen α1(I) chain of bone and a reduction in the α1(II) chain of cartilage. The mice showed decreased trabecular bone mass but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects, and normal cartilage growth plate histology.

These findings suggest that the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex plays a crucial role in collagen modification and maintenance of bone mass. The results also highlight the importance of distinguishing between the 3-hydroxylation and cis/trans isomerase activities of the complex in understanding the pathogenesis of OI. The study provides new insights into the tissue-specific consequences of selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.
Researchers have discovered that the P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded the species Drosophila simulans, a close relative of Drosophila melanogaster. This invasion has led to a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype, characterized by abnormal phenotypes such as sterility, in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years. A survey of 181 strains found that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Genomic and transcriptomic data revealed that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element.

A survey of 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years found that the P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed. Strains containing P-elements were rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype.

The P-element invasion in D. simulans is notable for its speed, with the element spreading across Europe, Africa, and North America in a surprisingly short period. Both D. simulans and D. melanogaster have evolved to suppress the dysgenesis phenotype by the end of the invasion, suggesting strong selection to ameliorate the P-element's effects. The study highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish genetic elements and the rapid adaptation of species to mitigate their impact.
Researchers have developed a new method to mark the bodies and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye. This technique allows for the rapid assessment of the mating success of sterilized males in the wild, which is crucial for controlling Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus populations using male-based sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT). The method involves feeding male mosquitoes on a sugar solution containing rhodamine B, which is then transferred to their bodies and seminal fluid. The study found that all concentrations of rhodamine B tested (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8%) resulted in successful body marking and transfer to females, with 0.4 and 0.8% solutions producing the longest-lasting marks. Importantly, the marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness. Field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females and recapture of marked males. The study suggests that rhodamine B marking is a useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies and a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments. This method is less expensive and less time-consuming than other methods, such as PCR and stable isotope semen labeling, and does not have the negative side effects of traditional marking methods.
Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce a severe inflammatory response that can lead to lethal shock. Researchers have discovered that these toxins must bind directly to the CD28 homodimer interface on T cells to elicit this response. CD28 is a costimulatory molecule that normally interacts with its B7 coligands to facilitate the immune response. However, in the case of superantigens, binding to CD28 is essential for the induction of inflammatory cytokine genes and toxicity.

Studies have shown that preventing access of the superantigen to CD28 is sufficient to block its lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superantigen challenge by short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and by peptides selected to compete with the superantigen for its binding site in CD28. The superantigen uses a conserved domain to engage CD28, and mutation of this domain abolished inflammatory cytokine gene induction and lethality.

Structural analysis revealed that CD28 can be accommodated as a third receptor in the quaternary complex formed by the superantigen, T cell receptor, and major histocompatibility class II molecule. This finding identifies the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigen toxins. The discovery of CD28 as a receptor for superantigens broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms and highlights a novel role for CD28 in the immune response.
Researchers have found that the Wnt/Tcf1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase, which is maintained by the lack of expression of cell cycle inhibitors. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is known to control ESC pluripotency, but its effect on the cell cycle of ESCs was unknown. This study shows that the Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to and activates the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus, leading to the restoration of the G1 phase and reduced proliferation of ESCs without affecting pluripotency. Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is responsible for this effect, and its recruitment to the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf mediates the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in ESCs. The study also found that activation of the Wnt pathway downregulates some cell differentiation genes while maintaining the expression of pluripotency genes. The cell cycle effects are dependent on β-catenin and Tcf1 but independent of Tcf3, indicating specialized and non-overlapping functions of Tcf/Lef factors in ESCs.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the immune response to dengue virus (DENV) infection. They found that pDCs from patients with mild dengue fever had higher levels of membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) compared to those with severe dengue or healthy controls. In vitro experiments showed that exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDCs and relocalized TRAIL from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited this process, suggesting that endocytosis plays a role in DENV-2 activation of pDCs. The researchers also found that pDCs produced IFN-α, which in turn led to the production of soluble or membrane-bound TRAIL by other cell types, including monocytes. In coculture experiments, pDCs reduced viral load in infected monocytes, and this effect was dependent on IFN-α production. The study suggests that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may play an important role in the outcome of dengue fever, with higher levels of pDC activation associated with milder disease. The findings provide new insights into the immune response to DENV infection and highlight the potential importance of pDCs in controlling viral replication and disease severity.
Researchers have investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in protecting against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TNF plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been linked to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) in animal studies. This study used a computational approach to analyze the effects of anti-TNF therapy on TB reactivation. The researchers simulated two commonly used anti-TNF treatments, a TNF-neutralizing antibody and a soluble TNF receptor fusion, in virtual clinical trials. They found that the bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor causing reactivation of latent infection. The study also showed that even low levels of soluble TNF (sTNF) are essential for controlling infection. Using a mathematical model, the researchers were able to distinguish the mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. The findings suggest that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the need to reduce inflammation with the need to maintain resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation.
A recent study investigated inter-population differences in the loss and expression of retrogenes in humans. Researchers used data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Illumina BodyMap project to analyze the variation in retrocopy loss among different human populations. They also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome and experimentally confirmed the existence of 193 retroduplication variations (RDVs). The majority of these RDVs resulted from retrocopy deletion, and most had not been previously reported.

The study found that the frequency of retrocopy absence was low for most retrogenes, with only a few showing absence in more than 50% of individuals. In contrast, new retropositions would be expected to have absence close to 100% of alleles in at least some populations. The researchers also examined retrocopy expression levels and found 9 retrogenes that underwent statistically significant differential expression between populations.

The study suggests that retrocopy polymorphisms not only provide insight into human population history but also into ongoing evolutionary processes. The availability of population RNA-Seq data allowed the researchers to study changes in retrocopy sequences and repertoire, as well as their potential functional implications. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the role of retrocopy polymorphisms in human evolution and highlight their potential as markers for population history and ongoing evolutionary processes.
Researchers studied how the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain affects the body's inflammatory response to praziquantel treatment in pigs with neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is a disease caused by the infection of the central nervous system by Taenia solium cysticerci. The study found that cysticerci located in the brain's parenchyma (tissue) caused a stronger inflammatory response after treatment with praziquantel compared to those located in the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain) or partially in contact with both the parenchyma and meninges. The inflammatory response in meningeal cysticerci was not significantly affected by treatment. In cases where cysticerci were partially in contact with both the parenchyma and meninges, the increase in inflammation was correlated with the extent of the cysticercus adjacent to the brain parenchyma. The study also found that the disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. In contrast, the inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to parenchymal cysticerci. These findings suggest that the suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason subarachnoid neurocysticercosis is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal neurocysticercosis. The study used histological specimens from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysticerci to investigate the characteristics of the inflammatory reaction around the cysticerci according to their location in the brain.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in two districts of Ghana to investigate the presence of yaws, a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue. The study aimed to determine if resistance to azithromycin, a key component of the World Health Organization's (WHO) yaws eradication campaign, had emerged or if alternative infections were responsible for reported cases. The study enrolled 90 children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws in 30 communities where mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma had previously been conducted. Treponemal and non-treponemal serology tests were negative in all children, indicating they had never been infected with yaws. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue were also negative, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities. However, H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, and the majority of lesions remained unexplained. The study suggests that integration of diagnostic testing into pre- and post-MDA surveillance systems is necessary to better inform yaws control programs. The findings have implications for the WHO's yaws eradication campaign, as Ghana is a major focus of yaws worldwide. The study highlights the need for accurate data on the epidemiology of yaws to guide disease eradication efforts.
Researchers have identified a potential strategy to combat HIV persistence by targeting the Jak-STAT pathway, a key regulator of T cell homeostasis. This pathway is involved in the establishment and maintenance of the HIV reservoir, a major challenge in HIV treatment. The study evaluated the effectiveness of two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, in blocking the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. The results showed that these inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells. The study also demonstrated that the Jak-STAT pathway is involved in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro, with pSTAT5 strongly correlating with increased levels of integrated viral DNA in vivo. Furthermore, the researchers found that Jak inhibitors prevented the transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells by inhibiting γ-C receptor cytokine-induced viral reactivation from latent stores. The study suggests that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence in vivo, and that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of γ-C cytokine ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets in vitro and ex vivo. These findings indicate that Jak inhibitors may represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence, and could be integrated into future curative strategies.
Researchers studied the response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to infection with two types of baculoviruses, a species-specific virus (SeMNPV) and a generalist virus (AcMNPV). Contrary to the expected shutdown of host gene expression, the larvae showed a balanced up- and down-regulation of genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Immune-related genes, including those involved in pattern recognition, signaling, and immune pathways, were found to be down-regulated. This down-regulation was also observed in the larval gut, where immune-related gene expression affects the balance of gut microorganisms.

The researchers hypothesized that the down-regulation of immune-related genes might lead to an increase in gut microbiota. Indeed, they found an increase in gut bacterial load after infection. Further experiments showed that the presence of gut microbiota enhanced the virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion of the baculovirus. This suggests that the down-regulation of immune-related genes in the gut may provide an advantage to the virus.

The study highlights the complex interaction between the host immune response and the gut microbiota in the context of viral infection. The findings suggest that the role of gut microbiota should not be ignored when studying virus infection. The researchers propose that baculoviruses may manipulate host immune responses to their advantage, possibly through the use of microRNAs that target both viral and host genes.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding the process of apomixis, a type of asexual reproduction in plants that produces seeds without fertilization. Apomixis is of great interest in agriculture due to its potential to improve crop yields and reduce the need for fertilization. A key component of apomixis is apomeiosis, where meiosis is deregulated, resulting in a mitotic-like division that retains the parent's genetic information.

Scientists have isolated and characterized a novel gene that controls the entry into the second meiotic division. By combining this gene with two others that affect meiotic processes, they created a genotype called MiMe, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. In MiMe plants, meiosis is completely replaced by a mitotic-like division, resulting in the production of functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant.

This discovery is a crucial step towards understanding and engineering apomixis. The researchers found that MiMe plants undergo a mitotic-like division instead of a normal meiotic division, without affecting subsequent sexual processes. The gametes produced by MiMe plants retain the mother plant's heterozygosity for every genetic marker tested, confirming that meiosis is indeed replaced by mitosis. This breakthrough has significant implications for the development of apomixis in crops, potentially leading to improved crop yields and reduced fertilization needs.
Researchers have developed a new approach to identify genes that cause diseases by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods for prioritizing disease-causing genes rely on a static picture of human PPIs, which may not accurately reflect the complex interactions within specific tissues. To address this limitation, the researchers constructed tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 healthy human tissues using gene expression data from those tissues. They then applied a gene prioritization algorithm to both the original and tissue-specific PPI networks and found that the tissue-specific variant yielded higher accuracy and ranked the correct gene more often than the original variant.

The researchers also demonstrated that incorporating tissue-specific gene expression data into the prioritization process can predict novel disease-tissue associations, which may indicate sub-clinical tissue effects that can escape early detection. They found that a large majority (71-83%) of known disease-causing genes are significantly expressed in the corresponding disease-associated tissue, supporting the hypothesis that a gene is likely to be expressed in a healthy tissue for its mutation to clinically manifest in that tissue. By using tissue-specific PPI networks, the researchers were able to enhance the performance of the gene prioritization algorithm and infer new disease-tissue associations. This approach has the potential to improve the identification of disease-causing genes and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria. The model takes into account the differential exposure of males and females to insecticides, varying concentrations of insecticides, and different selection pressures and dominance values. The model was used to investigate the effectiveness of two strategies to minimize the spread of resistance: sequential use of insecticides and their deployment as a mixture.

The study found that both strategies can be effective in delaying the spread of resistance, with some runs lasting over 500 mosquito generations (approximately 40 years). However, the relative performance of the two strategies depends on the attributes of the insecticides, their application, mosquito behavior, and genetics. The results suggest that mixtures of insecticides are favored when the effectiveness of the insecticides is high and exposure to the insecticide is low. Conversely, sequential deployment may be a more robust strategy if the insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes.

The study also found that using a mixture of insecticides can slow the spread of resistance, but may not always outperform sequential use. For example, a mixture may last 5 years, while two individual insecticides may last 3 and 4 years, resulting in an overall "lifespan" of 7 years for sequential use. The researchers emphasize that their model can be used to identify vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance.
Researchers have investigated the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a vector of Chagas disease, to better understand the complex interactions between this insect and its vertebrate host. Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification were used to analyze the sialome of R. neglectus, resulting in the deposition of 4,230 coding DNA sequences in GenBank. A set of 636 coding DNA sequences of proteins of putative secretory nature was extracted from the assembled reads, with 73 confirmed by proteomic analysis. The study revealed the presence of ubiquitous protein families, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5, as well as metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families. Notably, serine protease transcripts were detected in the sialome of R. neglectus. The findings improve our understanding of hematophagous arthropod sialomes and provide insights into the complex interplay between vectors and their vertebrate hosts. The study also highlights the potential of deep sequencing to discover new biological molecules in the saliva of bloodsucking insects, offering a new array of substances to be further investigated and functionally characterized. The research aims to catalog the transcripts of R. neglectus salivary glands with probable function in hematophagy, shedding light on the role of serine proteases and other secreted proteins in this process.
Researchers used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans to study how it responds to different types of bacteria found in soil. They exposed C. elegans to bacteria isolated from grassland soils and used a technique called transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are turned on or off in response to these bacteria. The researchers found that many of these genes are involved in metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting they play a role in how nematodes interact with their environment.

To test the importance of these genes, the researchers created mutations that inactivated 21 of the identified genes and measured the effects on the nematodes' lifespan and fitness in different bacterial environments. They found that most of these genes contribute to the nematodes' ability to survive and thrive in their environment.

The researchers also used statistical analysis to show that the degree to which a gene is turned on or off in response to different bacteria can predict how much of an effect that gene has on the nematodes' lifespan and fitness in those environments. This suggests that differential gene expression can be a good indicator of a gene's functional importance in the environment.

This study provides new insights into how nematodes interact with their bacterial environment and how these interactions can affect their life history traits. The findings have implications for understanding how changes in the environment, such as land use change, can impact nematode communities in grasslands.
Researchers have investigated the role of gene expression noise in the development of mammalian embryos, specifically the formation of the inner cell mass surrounded by a trophoectoderm. Using multi-scale, stochastic modeling, they found that gene expression noise enhances the robust organization of the early mammalian blastocyst. The study made three key predictions, which were supported by quantitative imaging: (1) stochasticity in gene expression promotes cell plasticity and accurately organizes the developing mouse blastocyst; (2) asymmetry in the levels of noise variation of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while minimizing its detrimental effects; and (3) the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, creating a time window for cells to adjust their fate based on their environment.

The results suggest that gene expression noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. The study found that noise in Cdx2 expression improves organization, while noise in Oct4 expression does not. The researchers also found that the amount of expression noise within embryos is consistent with the amounts required to provide a benefit. These findings support the hypothesis that gene expression noise has a substantial positive influence on TE/ICM organization and adds significant robustness to the correct structural arrangement of mouse blastocysts. Overall, the study highlights the importance of gene expression noise in the development of mammalian embryos.
Researchers have discovered that human germline antibody gene segments can encode antibodies with the ability to bind to multiple, diverse antigens. This property, known as polyspecificity, is typically acquired through somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells, which increase the binding affinity and specificity of the antibody for a particular epitope. However, a team of scientists used computational design to investigate whether germline gene-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity. They used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences that could engage multiple antigens at once. The results showed that the predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing the residues that enable polyspecificity.

The study found that key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework are critical contributors to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned sequences similar to the mature antibody sequence, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico. The researchers demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. The study suggests that computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow for the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation of locust hopper bands, which are large aggregations of locusts that can lead to destructive outbreaks. The model incorporates the interplay between individual locust behavior and spatial movement to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. The model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large-scale transition to the gregarious phase, in which locusts are attracted to each other and form large aggregations.

The model shows that at low densities, both gregarious and solitarious locusts are uniformly spread, with the solitarious phase dominating. However, as population density increases, a dense, traveling patch of gregarious locusts emerges, while solitarious locusts become scarce. This marks the onset of a hopper band. The model calculates the critical density beyond which the gregarious group forms and the final ratio of gregarious to solitarious locusts.

Behavioral state in locusts is plastic and dependent on local population density. In sparse surroundings, gregarious locusts transition to the solitarious state, while in crowded environments, solitarious locusts transition to the gregarious state. This phase transition is called gregarization and can lead to a destructive outbreak. Numerical simulations illustrate the rapid transitions that take place once gregarization is initiated, with dense packs of gregarious locusts forming and growing, and sweeping up solitarious locusts in their vicinity.
Researchers have identified a structural intermediate in the membrane fusion process of flaviviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis. The study used tick-borne encephalitis virus as a model to dissect the fusion pathway and associated structural changes of the envelope protein E. By exposing the virus to alkaline pH instead of acidic pH, the researchers were able to trap the virus in an intermediate conformation. In this state, the E protein dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide, but do not proceed to merge the membranes.

Further treatment with low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that the monomers correspond to an intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. The use of non-physiological conditions allowed the researchers to dissect the flavivirus fusion process and identify two separate steps: membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.

The study's findings are significant because they reveal a previously elusive intermediate in the flavivirus fusion process. The researchers were able to stabilize this intermediate by using alkaline pH, which prevents the formation of the final postfusion hairpin-like structure and inhibits fusion. The study's results contribute to our understanding of the complex process of viral membrane fusion and may have implications for the development of antiviral therapies.
A recent study investigated the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. The researchers compared Red List data for the British and South African floras and found that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, contradicting a simple, trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, the study revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks, but found that the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals.

The study analyzed the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades and suggested that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. The results indicate that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, the study found that the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects.

The study's findings have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions such as the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. The results also suggest that species turnover (speciation and extinction) might be rapid generally for plants, and high extinction rates may not be unusual over evolutionary timescales. The study highlights the need for detailed knowledge of interspecific phylogenetic relationships within higher taxa to estimate the true impact of plant extinctions on the loss of evolutionary history across the angiosperm tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, that interact with the Dectin-1 receptor in macrophages to facilitate the phagocytosis of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Dectin-1 is a crucial receptor in the innate immune system that helps prevent fungal infections. The study found that BTK and Vav1 are recruited to the phagocytic cup, a structure that forms around the fungus as it is engulfed by the macrophage. BTK and Vav1 colocalize with the lipid PI(3,4,5)P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol (DAG), which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, the researchers showed that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient macrophages displayed a defect in phagocytosis of both zymosan and C. albicans, and bone marrow-derived macrophages lacking BTK or Vav1 showed reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. Furthermore, BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice were more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild-type mice. These findings highlight the importance of BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C. albicans.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne disease that affects ruminants and humans. Madagascar was severely affected by RVF in 2008-2009, with a large and heterogeneous spread of the disease. To optimize surveillance and resource allocation, identifying at-risk environments is crucial. This study aimed to identify environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors that contribute to human infections in Malagasy contexts.

The study used Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to characterize Malagasy communes and Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze cattle and human serological data. The results showed that cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated with humid environments. Areas with high cattle density were at risk, and frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection. The eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar were identified as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle.

The study suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission. In humid environments, vectorial transmission by Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes is likely to occur in both cattle and humans. The relative contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions could be further assessed by mathematical modeling. The study's integrated approach provides new insights into RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar, highlighting the need to adapt control measures to the specific eco-climatic areas and transmission routes.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of transmission barrier in prions, which are self-propagating protein conformations. Prions can be transmitted between non-identical proteins, but this process is often inefficient. The study used a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. The prion domain of Rnq1 carries four discrete QN-rich regions, which can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants revealed that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission. However, transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength, even when the sequences of the common QNs are identical. This suggests that multiple prion determinants in complex prion domains act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and transmission barriers are determined by this cooperative fold. The study found that the [PIN+] prion domain is located in the QN-rich C-terminus of Rnq1, but no single QN region is essential for maintaining the prion state, indicating that Rnq1 prion domain carries multiple determinants capable of independently supporting the prion state.
Researchers have developed a new method for analyzing population genetic data using deep learning, a type of machine learning technique. This approach allows for the inference of complex population genetic models without the need for likelihood calculations, which can be computationally infeasible. The method uses a neural network to learn a feature-based function that maps input data, such as summary statistics, to output parameters of interest, such as population genetic parameters. The researchers applied this method to a dataset of 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia and found that it can effectively separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection. They also identified regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, soft sweeps, and balancing selection, and found that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Additionally, the demographic inference suggested that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning as a new inference framework for population genomic analysis and highlights its ability to accommodate more complex models than existing techniques. The researchers suggest that deep learning could be used to select optimal statistics for other methods, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), or to classify regions as neutral or selected for subsequent demographic inference.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes, specifically E6 and E7, play a crucial role in the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Research has shown that cells expressing these oncogenes are hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is responsible for repairing ICLs, is disrupted by E6 and E7. While E6 and E7 activate the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, they inhibit the completion of the repair process through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, E6 and E7 impair the colocalization of FancD2 with double-strand breaks (DSBs), hindering the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs. Additionally, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, a critical process for effective ICL repair. This delay is associated with the increased chromatin retention of FancD2, which hinders the activity of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP1 and activates the ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling pathway. Furthermore, E6 reduces the expression and foci formation of the repair protein Palb2, which is downstream of FancD2. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
Researchers have made significant progress in controlling onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, in the Southern Chiapas focus in Mexico. Since 1998, all 559 endemic communities in the area have received semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin, a medication that kills the parasite. In 2003, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 50 communities, and in 2009, an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen. This intensified treatment strategy led to a rapid suppression of transmission.

To assess the effectiveness of this approach, researchers conducted in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments in six sentinel communities that received two rounds of ivermectin treatment per year and three extra-sentinel communities that received four rounds per year. The results showed that none of the 67,924 black flies collected from the area during the dry season of 2011 contained parasite DNA, indicating a very low infective rate of 0.06 per 2,000 flies. Additionally, serological assays testing for Onchocerca volvulus exposure in 4,230 children under the age of 5 revealed that only 2 individuals (0.05%) were exposed to the parasite.

These findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community, indicating that the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus has been interrupted in the Southern Chiapas focus. The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas aims to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by the parasite and eventually eliminate transmission in all 13 foci in Latin America.
Researchers have identified a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, secreted by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes that enhances its ability to escape from host cell vacuoles and replicate within the host cell cytosol. The pPplA pheromone is generated through the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. Studies have shown that bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of non-professional phagocytic cells. However, mutational activation of the PrfA transcriptional activator restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling, suggesting a possible linkage between pPplA function and PrfA activation.

The pPplA peptide pheromone is thought to signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol. The pPplA peptide is processed from the N-terminal secretion signal sequence of the PplA lipoprotein and has functionally evolved to enhance vacuolar escape in non-professional phagocytic cells. The researchers propose a working model for the role of pPplA in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis, suggesting that the bacterium produces a basal level of PplA that is secreted through the general secretory pathway, which is then processed into the pPplA peptide pheromone.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the host's small intestine during infection. They used a technique called Tn-seq to identify genes involved in the bacterium's resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced by the host as a defense mechanism. The study found that a mutation in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, specifically in the mutS gene, gave Vibrio cholerae a colonization advantage in mice with high levels of ROS. However, this advantage was lost in mice treated with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which reduces ROS levels.

Further analysis revealed that the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC-treated mice was responsible for the enrichment of mutS mutants. Rugose variants can revert to smooth colonies when grown in a non-host environment. The study also found that the mutation rate of wild-type Vibrio cholerae colonizing NAC-treated mice was higher than in NAC-treated mice. These findings suggest that Vibrio cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to combat ROS during infection, resulting in the enrichment of beneficial phenotypes. The study's results can be used to model hypermutation in other pathogens and identify novel stress resistance mechanisms.
Researchers studied the role of the Mlh1-Mlh3 endonuclease in meiosis and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in baker's yeast. They created 60 new mutations in the mlh3 gene and analyzed their effects on meiotic recombination and MMR. Five mutations specifically disrupted MMR, while one mutation, mlh3-32, specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Biochemical analysis showed that Mlh1-mlh3-32 retained wild-type endonuclease activity, but was defective in interacting with the MMR component Msh2-Msh3. In contrast, Mlh1-mlh3-45 had wild-type endonuclease activity, but was defective in interacting with Msh2-Msh3. Whole-genome recombination maps revealed that all mlh3 mutants showed an increase in non-crossover events, suggesting that recombination intermediates were resolved through alternative pathways. These findings provide a structure-function map for Mlh3 and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3's enzymatic activity. The study also shows how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination pathways. The results suggest that Mlh1-Mlh3 plays a crucial role in meiotic crossing over, and that defects in protein-protein interactions can lead to changes in recombination outcomes.
Researchers have found that the structure of a host population plays a significant role in the reversion of bacteria to a drug-sensitive state after treatment is discontinued. When antibiotics are used intensively to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and gonorrhea, resistance levels in the bacterial population increase rapidly. This often leads to the discontinuation of older drugs and a switch to new ones. However, resistance levels may persist or decline slowly even after treatment is stopped.

Studies have attributed this phenomenon to the low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of the drug. However, a new study suggests that the structure of the host population, particularly the heterogeneity in the number of contacts between individuals, also affects the reversion dynamics. This heterogeneity leads to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population during treatment and affects the competition dynamics after treatment is stopped, mitigating the fitness advantages of the resistant strain.

As a result, the study found that the rate of reversion and the probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level are lower when there is heterogeneity in the host structure. Simulations showed that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal when the fitness costs of resistance are small, which is a biologically plausible scenario for many pathogen-drug combinations. The study's findings suggest that the structure of the host population is an important factor in the reversion of bacteria to a drug-sensitive state after treatment is discontinued.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by studying the interactions between genes affected by large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with autism. They used Drosophila, a fruit fly model organism, to examine the effects of dosage changes on neurological phenotypes. The study focused on unique Drosophila orthologues of genes affected by CNVs that had previously been linked to ASD-associated interaction networks and neural functioning.

The researchers found that dosage alterations of individual Drosophila orthologues of candidate genes from de novo CNVs resulted in neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants. They then examined pairwise dosage changes within the set of orthologues of candidate genes affected by the same single human de novo CNV and observed significant synergistic effects in three out of four CNVs with complete orthologous relationships.

The study demonstrated that the phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse resulting from these interacting genetic variants supported a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change. The researchers also observed specificity and transitivity between interactors, both within and between CNV candidate gene sets, supporting shared and distinct genetic aetiologies.

The findings suggest that synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease, and that different interactions affect divergent synaptic processes, demonstrating distinct molecular aetiologies. This study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between genes implicated in autism and the potential role of combinatorial effects in the development of ASD.
Researchers have investigated the role of CD8+ T cells in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), a severe complication of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in mice. While CD8+ T cells are known to play a central role in ECM, the mechanisms behind their pathogenic activity are not well understood. Using a combination of intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometric analysis, the study found that CD8+ T cells accumulate in the perivascular spaces of the brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing (P. berghei ANKA) and non-inducing (P. berghei NK65) parasites. However, perivascular T cells displayed arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection, characterized by long-term cognate interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within the brain.

The study also found that pathogenic CD8+ T cells colocalized with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, cellular apoptosis was a rare event and did not result in loss of cerebral vasculature. The researchers suggest that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms behind the pathogenic activity of CD8+ T cells in ECM and highlight the need for further investigation into the specific interactions between T cells and APCs during ECM-inducing malaria infections.
Researchers conducted a study in Vihiga County, Kenya to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors of tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. A total of 437 participants, aged 5 and above, were clinically examined for the presence of tungiasis in 21 villages across three sub-locations. The overall prevalence of tungiasis was found to be 21.5%, with the highest concentration of cases in Chambiti and Selelwe villages.

The study identified several factors associated with the occurrence of tungiasis, including low economic status, as indicated by a monthly income of Ksh ≤ 1000, earthen floors, and lack of toilet facilities. Other risk factors included age of participant ≤14, no regular use of closed footwear, and common resting places inside the house. The study used geographic information systems (GIS) to map the geographic distribution of tungiasis in the area, revealing no spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that the prevalence of the disease may be random.

The findings suggest that tungiasis is a significant health problem in Vihiga County, particularly among communities living in poverty. The study highlights the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies to address the disease. The results also emphasize the importance of understanding the geographic distribution and burden of neglected diseases like tungiasis to inform public health interventions.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how auxin and cytokinin hormones regulate vascular patterning in the Arabidopsis root tip. The model shows that an auxin maximum forms along the xylem axis due to mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinins, mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signalling. This interaction regulates the size and position of the hormones' signalling domains and specifies distinct boundaries between them. The model reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is unlikely and not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. The model also predicts and experimentally verifies a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning. Furthermore, it shows that polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilizes the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. The model also reveals that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other.
Researchers have identified a key player in the migratory locust's ability to change its behavior in response to environmental cues. The study found that a transcription factor called CREB-B acts as a mediator in the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which is involved in phase-related locomotor plasticity. This means that CREB-B plays a crucial role in switching the locust's locomotor activity between solitary and gregarious phases.

The researchers discovered that CREB-B directly activates the expression of brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by interacting with its promoter region. They also found that the phosphorylation of CREB-B at a specific site changes in response to variations in population density and is negatively controlled by NPF2. The study used RNA interference (RNAi) experiments and behavioral assays to validate the involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity.

Furthermore, the study revealed that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. The researchers characterized the promoter sequence of the NOS gene using genome walking and dual-luciferase assays. The findings highlight a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts. The study also suggests that the NPY/PKA/CREB-B signaling cascade may represent a common mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in animals.
Researchers have investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster, specifically during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), a period when the zygotic genome is activated after fertilization. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), the study mapped regions bound by ZLD in embryos at different stages of development. The results showed that ZLD binds to thousands of regions in the genome as early as mitotic cycle 8, long before the MZT, and maintains its binding through mitotic cycle 14. These regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes that are transcribed early in development, as well as the promoters of genes that are not transcribed until the MZT. The study found a strong association between ZLD binding and the onset of zygotic transcription, suggesting that ZLD plays a key role in activating the genome at the MZT. In fact, ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. The findings indicate that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in regulating genome activity at the MZT. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ZLD activation and its role in early embryonic development.
Researchers have identified 109 new protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes. These interactions occur on a 24-hour timescale and are essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock. Using a yeast-two-hybrid approach, the researchers found that the interaction between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 resulted in the destabilization of BMAL1. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed using circadian expression data, which predicted the timing of PPIs. Systematic analysis of the network revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting regulatory interactions to specific phases. This suggests that circadian PPIs play a crucial role in the temporal organization of cellular physiology. The researchers also found that PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular functions. The study provides a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics and highlights the importance of precisely timed PPIs for the circadian clockwork. Further research is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the PPI network among circadian oscillator proteins and their dynamics, as well as the regulation of circadian output processes via time-of-day dependent PPIs.
Researchers have determined the solution structure of a repeating unit of the ABA-1 Nematode Polyprotein Allergen (NPA) of Ascaris, a type of parasitic worm. The NPA is a unique class of lipid-binding proteins found only in nematodes, which are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small proteins with identical fatty acid and retinol-binding characteristics. These proteins are thought to play key roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection.

The ABA-1A unit, the most common repeating unit of the NPA of Ascaris suum, has a novel seven-helical fold with a long central helix that participates in two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and the amino acid sidechains affected by ligand binding were identified. Recombinant ABA-1A contains tightly-bound ligand(s) of bacterial culture origin in one of its binding sites.

This is the first mature, post-translationally processed, unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source, and it belongs to a new structural class. NPAs have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. The characterization of the unusual binding sites and the nature of the unidentified bacterial ligand(s) may be relevant to this. NPAs are also of interest for their relevance to parasitology and protein science, as they have affinity for pharmacologically active lipids and may play a role in subverting the host immune response.
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a significant public health concern in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), with a reported 39,677 cases from 17 PICTs between 1998 and 2008. The mean annual incidence of ciguatera was 194 cases per 100,000 people, a 60% increase from the reported annual incidence of 104 cases per 100,000 between 1973 and 1983. Taking into account under-reporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera over the last 35 years, exceeding prior estimates. Ciguatera is caused by consuming coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxin, which can lead to acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, as well as chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is often under-diagnosed and under-reported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. Ciguatera is a prevalent tropical and subtropical disease that has been an under-appreciated cause of acute and chronic disease in island communities. The incidence of ciguatera is predicted to continue to increase due to changes in global climate patterns, coastal development, and increased exploitation of coastal marine resources. This highlights the need for well-funded multidisciplinary research teams to translate research advances into practical management solutions to address this significant public health problem.
Researchers studied the impact of benznidazole treatment on the immune response of CD4+CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic Chagas disease. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. The study involved 38 patients with chronic Chagas disease and 12 healthy individuals. The researchers analyzed the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells before and after treatment with benznidazole. They also examined the expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells.

The results showed that CD4+CD8+ T cells were more common in patients with chronic Chagas disease than in healthy individuals. Additionally, these cells expressed and co-expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors in proportion to the severity of the disease. Benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. The treatment also reduced the co-expression level of inhibitory receptors and improved the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells.

After treatment, the researchers observed an increase in the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α. These cells were able to produce effector molecules that could help control the parasite. The study suggests that CD4+CD8+ T cells play an important role in the immune response against T. cruzi infection and that benznidazole treatment can improve the functional response of these cells.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) as the primary enzyme responsible for phosphoinositide metabolism in plants. Phosphoinositides play a crucial role in plant development and stress response, but previous studies have been hindered by the presence of multiple isoforms of phosphoinositide biosynthetic genes. The team isolated and analyzed knockout mutants of multiple AtPLC isoforms and found that AtPLC2 is the primary phospholipase in phosphoinositide metabolism. Lipidomic profiling of the mutants revealed that the plc2-1 mutant had increased levels of its substrates, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating that the major phosphoinositide metabolic pathway is impaired.

AtPLC2 was found to be highly expressed in specific tissues, including trichomes, young floral buds, and vascular tissues, and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. The seedlings of the plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects that were complemented by heterologous expression of AtPLC2, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth. Furthermore, the plc2-1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by changes in relevant phenotypes and gene expression profiles. These findings reveal the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth, and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response.
The article challenges the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. A principled measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, denoted as Φ, is employed to evaluate the causal power of systems across different spatial and temporal scales. By considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates, the authors show that a macro system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents. This is due to the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, where stable local maxima of Φ are identified during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus. The results refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries. By evaluating cause-effect power of black-box systems across many spatiotemporal scales, the authors show that there can be several local maxima of macro cause-effect power, capturing emergent functional roles of black-box macro elements. The framework uses the interventional and counterfactual causal framework of integrated information theory to quantify intrinsic cause-effect power and system mechanisms at the micro level and all possible black-boxed macro levels.
Researchers have investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), which plays a crucial role in cellular adaptation to environmental changes and can also cause cell damage under certain conditions. To better understand the mechanisms behind ROS production, a rule-based model of complex III in the RC was extended to account for electron transport, proton translocation, and other processes. The model was validated by fitting it to experimental data from rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and it accurately predicted the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I.

The analysis revealed an association between ROS production and the levels of specific radicals in individual electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. It was also found that the phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted and confirmed experimentally. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC.

The model suggests that various states of respiratory complexes formed during electron transport, including those containing free radicals, contribute to ROS production. Free radicals can pass unpaired electrons to oxygen, forming superoxide radicals and other forms of ROS. The model's predictions were validated by comparing measured ROS production and the levels of various free radicals under the same conditions.
Researchers have investigated the effects of mutations in motor proteins on intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells. Motor proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy to transport cargo over long distances. Disruptions in transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that phosphorylation of the kinesin motor domain at a specific serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, resulting in lowered single motor stalling forces.

A semi-analytical approach was developed to analyze the transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. The study found that mutants with altered stall forces can determine the average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. When the load on the cargo is near the mutant's stalling force or a multiple of it, mutants gain a competitive advantage and increase the expected run-length.

The researchers also developed a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. This technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. The method can be used to introduce alterations of single motor parameters to model mutations and deduce their effects on transport. The approach is easily implementable, and a software package is provided for general use.
Researchers investigated the role of the CACNA1C gene in learning by selectively ablating the gene in mice and analyzing their behavior on an operant cue discrimination task. The CACNA1C gene codes for the α subunit of Cav1.2 high-voltage-gated calcium channels, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity and learning. Previous studies have linked altered expression of Cav1.2 channels and the CACNA1C gene to severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. In this study, mice with a selective knockout of the CACNA1C gene were compared to matched controls on a 2-choice operant cue discrimination task. The task consisted of three phases and required the mice to perform a nose poke response on one side of a touchscreen box based on the position of a light square on the screen. The results showed that the CACNA1C knockout mice did not exhibit impaired learning in general, but rather adopted a different learning strategy compared to the controls. Specifically, the knockout mice increased reward feedback across trials by adapting an outcome-based strategy, whereas the controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. This suggests that the CACNA1C gene plays a specific role in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The findings may also have implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with the CACNA1C gene.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria are being released in various parts of the world to suppress the spread of arboviruses. The success of this approach depends on the bacteria's ability to invade and persist in mosquito populations, which is influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature fluctuations. Researchers investigated how different types of Wolbachia infections (wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA) respond to cyclical heat stress in Aedes aegypti larvae.

The study found that wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections exhibited reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbachia, when reared at temperatures ranging from 26 to 37°C. Additionally, the density of Wolbachia in adults was significantly reduced under these conditions. Furthermore, the wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to these temperatures across all life stages.

In contrast, the wAlbB infection maintained a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under the same temperature conditions. These findings have significant implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions in different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing. The results suggest that temperature fluctuations can impact the effectiveness of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in controlling arbovirus transmission.
Researchers have isolated and characterized adenoviruses from the gastrointestinal tracts of non-human primates, including great apes and macaques. The study aimed to understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in these animals. The results show that healthy populations of great apes and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in their stool, with shedding frequencies ranging from 22-38% among chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. In contrast, shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, similar to previously reported frequencies.

The researchers purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Analysis of the new ape adenovirus sequences revealed that they could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E. The study also found evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses and cross-species transmission events in the natural history of B and E viruses.

The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling and housing. The presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should also be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors. These findings have implications for the use of adenoviruses as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines.
Researchers have used molecular dynamics simulation to study the process of unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of chromatin, where DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. The study used an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The results showed that the free energy change for unwrapping is about 11.5 kcal/mol, which agrees with values obtained in single-molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating multiple potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. The study found that the unwrapping process starts at one end of the DNA, where the first five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes. The study's findings support a quantitative theoretical model of DNA unwrapping and disassociation from the histone octamer, which explains the differences in the rate of nucleosome disassembly caused by hMSH2-hMSH6 between two DNA sequences and between histone modification states.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which a protein called Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) protects cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can harm cells by damaging their membranes, and lysosomes, which are essential for cellular function, are particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. ApoD is a protein that has antioxidant properties and is secreted by certain cells in the nervous system, such as astrocytes, to help protect neurons from oxidative stress.

The study found that ApoD is endocytosed, or taken into cells, and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Once inside the lysosomes, ApoD helps to maintain their functional integrity by preventing membrane permeabilization and keeping lipid peroxides levels under control. This process is critical for maintaining lysosomal pH gradients, which are essential for cellular function.

The researchers used a combination of single-lysosome in vivo pH measurements and immunodetection to demonstrate ApoD's role in lysosomal pH homeostasis. They found that ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic environment of the lysosome and is sufficient and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in both astrocytes and neurons.

The study also showed that ApoD is required for two lysosomal-dependent biological processes: myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy in a Drosophila in vivo model. These findings uncover a previously unknown biological function of ApoD and suggest that lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity is a new mechanism critical for the outcome of various neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers studied the biology and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani of Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies from two geographically distant localities in Ethiopia: Melka Werer, a non-endemic site in the lowlands, and Addis Zemen, an endemic focus of human visceral leishmaniasis in the highlands. The study aimed to determine if genetic differences between the two colonies could explain the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in Melka Werer. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR and DNA sequencing of mitochondrial genes did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies.

The researchers found that the two colonies had distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation, but this did not affect their susceptibility to L. donovani. Experimental infections showed that even the lowest infective dose tested (2×10^3 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donovani infections in about 50% of the P. orientalis females. Using higher infective doses, the infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. The development of L. donovani in P. orientalis was fast, with the presence of metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and the colonization of the stomodeal valve by haptomonads recorded in most P. orientalis females by day five post-blood feeding.

Both colonies were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donovani strains, with the average volume of blood-meals taken by P. orientalis females being about 0.7 µl. The infective dose at the lowest concentration was one or two L. donovani promastigotes per sand fly blood-meal. The study suggests that the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in Melka Werer cannot be attributed to different susceptibility of local P. orientalis populations to L. donovani.
Researchers in China conducted a study to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, a serious and under-recognized disease. The study aimed to provide updated data for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which has not included advanced schistosomiasis japonica in its estimates. A total of 215 patients with confirmed advanced schistosomiasis japonica were evaluated using a questionnaire, physical examination, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. The results showed that most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall disability weight (DW) for advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated to be 0.447, with age-specific DWs ranging from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged 60 years or older. The study found that DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These findings suggest that advanced schistosomiasis japonica has a significant impact on patients' quality of life and disability, and highlight the need for updated data in the GBD study and evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
A study in Kenya examined the relationship between tsetse fly habitats and population vulnerability to Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as nagana. The study used 1999 national census data to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts, where tsetse flies are capable vectors for T. b. rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT. The researchers used a multilevel study design to estimate the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty.

The study found that tsetse fly habitats were significantly associated with increased disability prevalence in Kenya. The researchers identified two exposure pathways: direct exposure from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection, and indirect exposure as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional deficiencies and poverty. The study suggests that incorporating reports on disability from the national census is a promising surveillance tool that may enhance future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of HAT and AAT and the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas are likely contributors to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level.
Researchers have identified the mechanism by which hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induces cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. HMBA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the release of active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV promoter, stimulating transcription elongation and viral production. However, the released P-TEFb rapidly reassembles with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1, limiting the duration of HIV transcription.

The study found that inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway or expressing a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonizes HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. This suggests that HMBA targets the pivotal cellular co-factor P-TEFb for the reactivation of HIV. The researchers demonstrated that HMBA reactivates viral production in chronically infected cells via the transient release of active P-TEFb from the complex, which is dependent on the transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

The study reveals that HMBA disrupts the complex in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner to release P-TEFb, which is then recruited to the HIV promoter and coding sequences, allowing RNAPII to elongate successfully on the viral genome. The findings suggest that the stimulation of HIV transcription by HMBA can occur independently of NF-κB, and that the abundance of active P-TEFb leads to viral transcription in the absence of Tat.
Researchers have identified a link between the Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) and the development of severe forms of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The virus is found in certain species of Leishmania parasites, such as L. guyanensis, and is associated with elevated parasitaemia, destructive inflammation, and an increased risk of complications. To detect LRV, scientists have developed a new method using an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody called J2, which can recognize double-stranded RNA in a sequence-independent manner. This method can be used in various techniques, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, and has been shown to be effective in detecting LRV in several parasite strains, a freshly isolated patient sample, and lesion biopsies of infected mice. The researchers propose that this method could be used as a diagnostic tool to predict the LRV-related risk of leishmanial dissemination in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a significant public health concern, with 12 million infections and 350 million people at risk across 98 countries. The disease can present in two major forms: cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is generally localized and self-healing, and visceral leishmaniasis, which can be fatal if left untreated.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. To trigger pedestal formation, EPEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. Research has shown that the ability to generate these structures correlates with bacterial colonization in animal models, but the precise function of pedestals in infection remained unclear.

Recent studies have characterized the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells. Both pathogens formed distinct bacterial communities, or "macrocolonies," that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Notably, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell.

These findings reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission. The data suggest that the EHEC mechanism of pedestal assembly provides a colonization advantage over the EPEC pathway of actin polymerization in infections of polarized intestinal epithelia.
Researchers compared two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica. The two methods, differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), are commonly used to isolate EVs from other pathogens. The study found that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than those isolated by DC. Additionally, SEC-purified EVs had a higher purity to free excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield ratio compared to DC-purified EVs. Proteomic analysis revealed that DC-purified EVs contained a higher diversity of protein identifications and unique peptide hits, indicating contamination from ESP and tegumental components. In contrast, SEC-purified EVs contained fewer tegumental-based proteins. The results suggest that DC and SEC purification methods do not isolate equivalent EV population profiles, and caution should be taken when choosing a purification method. The study proposes that SEC methods should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies. This is because SEC-purified EVs are less contaminated with ESP and tegumental components, which are important for understanding the role of EVs in host-pathogen communication. The findings have implications for the development of reliable protocols for EV isolation and application in helminth pathogen research.
Researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the development of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. They focused on the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant, which play a crucial role in pattern formation during early embryonic development. The team used detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to develop and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation. This approach allowed them to determine whether post-transcriptional regulation is necessary for patterning in this system.

The results showed that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrated that the uniqueness and specificity of the fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation. This increases the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other complex biological processes.

The researchers used a rigorous method to determine whether the model parameters can be properly identified, which is essential for reverse engineering. They applied this approach to a complex regulatory problem, the dynamics of spatio-temporal pattern formation in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. The study provides new insights into the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in animal development and demonstrates the power of reverse engineering in understanding complex biological processes.
Researchers investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in mice. They found that the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3), a receptor for viral double-stranded RNA, is low in the epithelium of suckling mice but increases significantly during the postnatal period. This increase in Tlr3 expression inversely correlates with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in Tlr3 or the adaptor molecule Trif exhibit higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in Tlr3 or Trif do not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. The study also found that the non-hematopoietic cell compartment contributes to the Trif-mediated antiviral host response in adult animals. Furthermore, a significant age-dependent increase in TLR3 expression was detected in human small intestinal biopsies. The results suggest that the upregulation of epithelial TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. The study highlights the importance of Tlr3 and Trif in the innate immune response to rotavirus infection and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the age-dependent susceptibility to this virus.
Researchers conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) repository. The WES data came from two centers using different methods to produce sequence and call variants. To ensure the distribution of rare variation was similar across centers, variants were filtered by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. Gene-based analyses of association were evaluated using seven samples sequenced at both centers and results from the association study.

The researchers explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and found that, unlike some recent studies, principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. After using various gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, the study found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. The results suggest that standard gene-based tests will require much larger samples of cases and controls before being effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.

The study used data from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), the Autism Simplex Collection (TASC), National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), and the Boston's Autism Consortium. The results indicate that thousands of individuals are required to obtain genome-wide significance, highlighting the challenges of identifying novel ASD genes via rare variants.
Researchers investigated the link between genetic variations in the chitotriosidase and AMCase genes and the risk of developing mycetoma caused by the fungus Madurella mycetomatis. Mycetoma is a type of infection characterized by the formation of grains in the body, and Madurella mycetomatis is the most common cause of this infection in Sudan. The researchers studied 112 patients with mycetoma and 103 healthy individuals from Sudan. They analyzed four genetic variations in the chitotriosidase and AMCase genes, which affect the activity of enzymes that break down chitin, a component of the fungal cell wall. The researchers found that a variation in the chitotriosidase gene, which impairs enzyme activity, was associated with a higher risk of developing mycetoma. In contrast, variations in the AMCase gene, which increase or decrease enzyme activity, were not linked to the risk of mycetoma. The presence of chitin in the fungal grain was confirmed through histological staining. The study suggests that impaired chitotriosidase activity may play a role in the development of mycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between genetic variations and the risk of mycetoma.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV was thought to have two distinct phases: an acute or lytic phase, where the virus replicates and causes symptoms, and a latent phase, where the virus remains dormant. However, recent studies have suggested that the lytic phase may not be as clear-cut as previously thought.

Using a highly sensitive Cre-marking model, the researchers found that around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred after the initial acute infection. This challenges the traditional understanding of the lytic and latent phases. Furthermore, the study provides direct evidence that lytic promoters, which drive the expression of viral genes, can also be active during latency. This means that the virus may be producing proteins during the latent phase, which could be recognized by the immune system.

The researchers also used a virus with a Cre promoter driven by the ICP47 gene, which is associated with immune recognition. They found that in some cases, the virus that spreads after the first week of infection is initiating lytic gene expression. However, no further marking was noted during latency, suggesting that lytic gene expression may not be a continuous process. These findings suggest that the relationship between adaptive immunity and viral gene expression during all phases of HSV-1 infection is more complex than previously thought.
Researchers studied the accumulation of a misfolded protein called PrPSc in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to compare the pattern of PrPSc accumulation in neurons and glial cells, such as astroglia and microglia, in the central nervous system (CNS). The results showed that each strain had a unique pattern of PrPSc accumulation, with strain 22L mainly associated with astroglia, strain ME7 mainly associated with neurons and neuropil, and strain RML showing a mix of both patterns depending on the brain region.

The researchers also studied the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus of infected mice at early stages of the disease. Surprisingly, despite the differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. The upregulation of these genes correlated with the activation of both astroglia and microglia, indicating an early neuroinflammatory response. This response occurred before the development of vacuolar pathology or clinical signs of the disease.

The findings suggest that the neuroinflammatory response in prion diseases may be more similar than previously thought, despite differences in the pattern of PrPSc accumulation. This could have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies against prion diseases, which are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed polymers that are topologically constrained, making it challenging to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate their behavior. To address this challenge, the researchers proposed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Their approach accurately accounts for the polymer entanglement length and volumic density, allowing for a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and enabling the study of long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics.

The researchers used their formalism to investigate the time evolution of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). They combined their coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions, which quantitatively reproduced experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicted that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. The study demonstrated the utility of their coarse-graining approach to study chromatin organization in drosophila and emphasized the necessity to adequately account for the time evolution of chromosome organization in quantitative models, especially for higher eucaryotes where chromosomes are strongly topologically constrained. The approach is generic and can be applied to any self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems, offering a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes.
Researchers have been using expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to understand how genetic variants influence gene expression and contribute to complex traits and diseases in humans. However, the cell type specificity of eQTLs, which refers to how genetic variants affect gene expression in specific cell types, is not well understood. To address this, a study integrated eQTL data from 11 studies on 7 cell types with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project. The researchers found that eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that overlap with cell type-specific CREs, such as enhancers, promoters, and repressive chromatin marks, are associated with cell type-specific eQTLs. This suggests that the cell type specificity of eQTLs is influenced by the interaction between genetic variants and CREs.

Using a random forest classifier, the researchers demonstrated that they could predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs based on the overlap between eQTL SNPs and CREs. They also showed that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate genome-wide association study (GWAS) associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell type specificity of eQTLs and highlight the importance of integrating eQTL and CRE data to better understand the relationship between genetic variants and gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new cell line for producing HIV-1 vaccine immunogens with specific glycosylation patterns. The cell line, created using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This is achieved by inactivating the MGAT1 gene, which is responsible for adding sialic acid to glycans. The resulting immunogens exhibit improved binding to broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that recognize glycan-dependent epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120. The new cell line, called MGAT1− CHO, preserves the structure of glycan-independent epitopes, such as those recognized by the VRC01 antibody.

The development of this cell line addresses a major challenge in HIV vaccine research: producing immunogens that elicit bN-mAbs. Traditional Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines used for biopharmaceutical production incorporate complex and hybrid glycosylation, which can hinder the binding of glycan-dependent bN-mAbs. The MGAT1− CHO cell line offers a solution to this problem, enabling the production of gp120 immunogens with high-mannose glycosylation, which is similar to the glycosylation pattern found on the surface of virions and native envelope proteins.

The MGAT1− CHO cell line has several advantages, including improved binding to glycan-dependent bN-mAbs and the ability to grow at high cell densities without impairing its doubling time. This makes it a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. The development of this cell line brings us closer to creating a vaccine that can elicit bN-mAbs, which are critical for protecting against HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a promising target for developing anthelmintic drugs. T6PP is essential for the survival of nematodes, as its absence leads to the toxic accumulation of trehalose 6-phosphate in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The protein structure of T6PP from B. malayi was determined using X-ray crystallography, revealing a unique combination of a stabilizing N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate, identified five key residues important for binding and catalysis. A proposed model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex suggests a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions. In contrast to other carbohydrate-binding proteins, the trehalose binding site of T6PP is not dominated by hydrophobic residues. The conservation of key binding site residues among T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests that a common strategy for T6PP inhibitor design could be used to develop both anthelmintics and antibiotics. The structure of T6PP from B. malayi provides a platform for the design of high-affinity inhibitors that target the phosphoryl-binding pocket and the trehalose pocket, potentially leading to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to simulate the transport of fluid through tumors, taking into account the unique and disorganized vascular architecture of individual tumors. This framework, which incorporates realistic tumor vasculature and spatially heterogeneous blood vessel and interstitial permeabilities, allows for accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. The model was applied to two types of tumors: an orthotopic murine glioma and a human colorectal carcinoma xenograft. The results showed that incorporating realistic tumor vasculature is crucial for accurately predicting the spatial flow heterogeneities induced by blood vessels. The study also found that reducing tumor interstitial fluid pressure is not necessary to increase interstitial perfusion, and that developing an interstitial fluid pressure gradient across the tumor is the key response. Furthermore, the researchers hypothesized that vascular normalization alters interstitial hydraulic conductivity within tumors, suggesting that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors. This framework has the potential to optimize and engineer anti-cancer therapies by incorporating the inherent variability and heterogeneity of tumors. The model can be applied to whole, large vascular networks, allowing for predictions of whole tumor fluid dynamics that incorporate the inherent architectural heterogeneities occurring at the micron-scale.
Researchers have investigated how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads from one cell to another, a process known as cell-cell transmission. They found that the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies, which are a key component of an effective HIV vaccine, varies depending on the mode of transmission. Specifically, antibodies that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the virus, such as the potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody VRC01, lose potency during cell-cell transmission. In contrast, antibodies that target the gp41 region of the virus remain active. This suggests that CD4bs antibodies primarily block free virus transmission, while allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. The study's findings provide a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains its infectivity and evades potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in the body. The research highlights the need to consider the efficacy of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies in blocking both cell-free and cell-cell transmission of HIV. The study's results have implications for the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, as it remains uncertain whether both modes of transmission must be blocked with equal efficacy or if only the dominant transmission mode needs to be targeted.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses in the visual system. The model suggests that top-down attentional modulation in higher visual areas, such as V4 or MT, can produce complex changes in neural firing rates and receptive field structure. This is achieved through modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. The feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This results in changes to neural responses, including receptive field expansion towards the focus of attention.

The model reproduces the observed effects of attention on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters. It also makes a novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell. The model proposes that the observed effects of attention arise spontaneously from the interaction of feedback connections between higher and lower areas with short-range divisive mutual inhibition between neighboring cells within each area. The source of attentional modulation in the model is a plain response modulation of the top layer, which models the intermediate layers of the visual cortex. This is in contrast to existing models of attentional effects, which often posit that attention operates through gain modulation of inputs to the studied layer.
In Drosophila, a small group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (PSC) plays a crucial role in controlling blood cell homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The PSC acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors, allowing them to differentiate into lamellocytes, a type of immune cell required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasitism. A short type I cytokine-related receptor called CG14225/Latran is necessary for switching off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes, a prerequisite for massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitization. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor, and antagonizes Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. In response to wasp parasitism, there is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the Latran/Domeless ratio, leading to the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling. This study provides the first in vivo example of a role for a non-signalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, raising the question of whether short, non-signalling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity. The regulation of JAK/STAT signalling by Latran is crucial for Drosophila to mount a dedicated cellular immune defense against wasp parasitism.
Researchers studied how two viruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus (ToLCV), interact and recombine when infecting tomato plants over a 120-day period. They found that recombination patterns between the two viruses are complex and influenced by factors such as local sequence similarity, but not genomic secondary structure. The study also showed that natural selection plays a significant role in shaping the overall patterns of recombination, favoring the preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

The researchers observed a wide range of recombinant genomes, with some containing up to 58 detectable recombination breakpoints, which is more complex than previously reported in similar studies. They also found that selection against individual recombinants with disrupted intra-genomic interactions, such as those required for proper protein and nucleic acid folding, influences the overall patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that selection favoring the preservation of co-evolved longer-range protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions is so strong that it can be used to identify the exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in begomoviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA viruses that includes many crop pathogens. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how these viruses evolve and adapt to their hosts, and may inform strategies for developing more effective control measures against begomoviral diseases.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Nucleosomes have been found to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. Interestingly, histone proteins, the building blocks of nucleosomes, have also been discovered in some archaeal genomes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ significantly from their eukaryotic counterparts in terms of their structure and assembly.

Despite these differences, researchers found that the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is surprisingly conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. To understand this finding, researchers examined whether selection or mutation could explain the concordant substitution patterns in the two kingdoms. However, they found that neither the mutation nor the selection model was sufficient to explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence divergence.

Instead, researchers demonstrated that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a third model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. They showed that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have identified key positions in proteins that are crucial for maintaining conformational diversity, which is essential for protein function. Conformational diversity refers to the ability of a protein to exist in multiple shapes and forms, allowing it to bind to different ligands and perform various functions. The study used a novel method to analyze 188 paired protein structures in their ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. The researchers found that certain positions in the protein, specifically buried aliphatic residues located in regular structural regions such as beta-sheets and alpha-helices, are evolutionarily conserved and play a key role in mediating the conformational change between the ligand-free and ligand-bound states. These positions were identified by analyzing the effect of simulated point mutations on the protein's vibrational normal modes, which are essential for the conformational change. The researchers found a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on these normal modes and the position-specific evolutionary conservations obtained from multiple sequence-structure alignments. This suggests that these conserved positions are critical for maintaining the protein's conformational diversity and its ability to bind to different ligands. The study provides new insights into the relationship between protein structure, function, and evolution, and highlights the importance of conformational diversity in protein function.
Researchers have investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. FBA is a key enzyme in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, which are essential for Mtb's ability to establish and maintain infections. To understand the importance of FBA in Mtb's metabolism, the researchers engineered a strain of Mtb in which FBA levels could be controlled. They found that depleting FBA led to the clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in mice and reduced viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, when cultured on a mixture of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, Mtb was able to grow and compensate for the lack of FBA. The researchers discovered that this compensation required a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, where the metabolism of butyrate depended on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings suggest that FBA is a potential target for new chemotherapies against tuberculosis and highlight the importance of understanding Mtb's metabolic flexibility in different environments. The study provides new insights into the role of FBA in Mtb's metabolism and the conditions under which it is essential for the bacterium's growth and survival.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) in the parasite Leishmania, which causes leishmaniasis. Leishmania lacks enzymes that typically remove peroxides, and mTXNPx was thought to play a crucial role in this process. However, the study found that mTXNPx is not necessary for the parasite to remove peroxides. Instead, the researchers discovered that mTXNPx acts as a molecular chaperone, helping to keep other proteins in their correct shape and function. This chaperone activity is essential for the parasite's ability to infect mice. When mTXNPx was removed from the parasite, it was unable to infect mice, but this was not due to its inability to remove peroxides. The researchers created a version of mTXNPx that was unable to remove peroxides and found that it was still able to rescue the parasite's ability to infect mice. This suggests that mTXNPx's chaperone activity, not its peroxidase activity, is essential for the parasite's infectivity. The study's findings challenge the previous understanding of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, which were thought to only play a role in removing peroxides. The discovery of mTXNPx's chaperone activity provides new insights into the parasite's biology and may have implications for the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Researchers conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, specifically the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV-infected patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PDH from two secondary and eight tertiary-care facilities in Mexico. The results showed that the HUAg test had a sensitivity of 67.1% and a specificity of 97.5% when compared to the reference standard of Histoplasma capsulatum growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or compatible histopathologic exam. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2.

The study found that the HUAg test may be useful for starting early antifungal treatment, but a culture-based approach is necessary due to the high frequency of co-infections, particularly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. In 10.5% of patients with proven PDH, a co-existing opportunistic infection was diagnosed. The study highlights the importance of considering co-infections when diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients.

The results of this study are consistent with previous reports from other regions, including a study in Brazil that found a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.9% for the same HUAg test. However, the study notes that the results are difficult to compare due to differences in study design. The researchers conclude that the HUAg test is a useful tool for diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients, but a culture-based approach is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out co-infections.
Researchers used a new approach called "micro-mass sequencing" to study the viruses present in stool samples from 12 children with acute diarrhea. This method allows for the analysis of small amounts of stool, as little as 100 milligrams, with minimal processing. The goal was to identify both known and unknown viruses that may be contributing to diarrhea.

The study found that known enteric viruses were present in the stool samples, as well as multiple sequences from viruses that were not previously identified. These novel viruses showed limited similarity to known viruses in a database called GenBank. The researchers were able to detect these viruses by sequencing only a few hundred colonies from each sample library.

This study builds on previous research that has explored the diversity of viruses in various ecosystems, including the ocean and the human gut. However, this is the first metagenomic investigation of the viral diversity found in human diarrhea. The results of this study will serve as a foundation for further research into the roles of these diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.

The findings have the potential to improve our understanding of the causes of diarrhea, which is a leading cause of death in children worldwide. Diarrhea is responsible for approximately 1.8 million deaths annually, and in up to 40% of cases, the cause is unknown. By identifying new viruses that may be contributing to diarrhea, researchers may be able to develop new treatments or prevention strategies.
A study in the Dominican Republic compared the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue viruses, two arboviruses that caused large outbreaks in the country from 2014 to 2016. The researchers used national surveillance data to analyze the age and sex distribution of cases, as well as the reproductive number (R0) of each outbreak. The study found that 75% of dengue cases occurred in individuals under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more evenly distributed among the population. Dengue attack rates were slightly higher in males, but Zika infections were significantly more common in females, with age-adjusted attack rates of 7.64 per 10,000 population compared to 2.72 per 10,000 population in males. The reproductive number (R0) calculations also showed a higher metric among females. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) attack rates were slightly higher in males. The study suggests that existing dengue immunity had little impact on Zika attack rates at the population level. The findings indicate that community awareness campaigns may have influenced the increased reporting of Zika cases among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. The study recommends media campaigns and screening for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks, and suggests that future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2) plays a more significant role in DNA damage and immune responses than poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). This is in contrast to animals, where PARP1 is the primary enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribosylation) in response to DNA damage. PARP2 is distinct from PARP1 in that it contains SAP DNA binding motifs rather than the zinc finger domains found in both plant and animal PARP1 proteins. The study found that knockout of PARP2, rather than PARP1, severely depleted detectable PARP activity in Arabidopsis, indicating that PARP2 is the primary enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribosylation) in response to DNA damage.

The study also found that poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase 1 (PARG1), rather than PARG2, is the primary enzyme responsible for removing poly(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins in Arabidopsis. The activity or abundance of PARP2 is influenced by PARP1 and PARG1, and the two enzymes physically interact with each other and with PARG1 and PARG2. The study suggests that the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosylation) in plants is distinct from that in animals, with PARP2 and PARG1 playing the predominant roles in plant poly(ADP-ribosylation) during DNA damage and immune responses.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates synapse formation and learning. This pathway, called the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway, is composed of four kinases: MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K), and JNK-1 (MAPK). The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway opposes the action of the RPM-1 protein, which is involved in regulating synapse formation and axon termination. In the absence of RPM-1, the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway suppresses defects in synapse formation, but not axon termination, in the mechanosensory neurons of C. elegans. This suggests that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway plays a specific role in regulating glutamatergic synapse formation. Overexpression of the kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals, indicating that this pathway is involved in regulating synapse development. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, providing further evidence of its role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These findings indicate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.
Researchers have investigated the sex-determination protein TRA-1 in hermaphroditic nematodes, specifically Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that TRA-1 is bipotential, meaning it can both activate and repress the same target genes in response to changing signals. The study identified a co-factor, TRR-1, which works with TRA-1 to control the sperm/oocyte decision in C. briggsae. TRR-1 is required for spermatogenesis and is part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex. It promotes the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene necessary for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests revealed that TRR-1 works through TRA-1 to activate Cbr-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision, demonstrating that TRA-1 is indeed bipotential. The study also found that TRR-1 regulates the development of the male tail and that C. briggsae trr-1 null mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, while C. elegans fem null mutants prevent spermatogenesis. However, synthetic interactions confirmed that both halves of the switch exist in each species, showing that the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution.
Researchers have developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the integrated information generated by a system as it transitions between states. These measures can be applied to time-series data and overcome the limitations of a previous measure, ΦDM, which is only defined for discrete Markov systems. The new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, can be used to examine information integration in real and model systems, providing new opportunities for understanding the relationship between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, the findings also pose challenges for theories that attribute physical meaning to the measured quantities.

Previous measures of integrated information, such as ΦDM, were formulated in the context of the integrated information theory of consciousness (IITC). According to the IITC, consciousness is equivalent to integrated information and has the status of a fundamental property of the universe. In contrast, the new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, are framed in terms of process, allowing for the formulation of testable hypotheses and the specification of synthetic models to examine the role of integrated information in neurocognitive processes. The distinction between capacity and process has implications for theories, such as the IITC, that ascribe physical meaning to measures of integrated information.

The researchers plan to empirically examine integrated information for time-series data acquired from neuroimaging and other biological datasets to test intuitions regarding consciousness and other neurocognitive processes. They also aim to investigate how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations of a system embedded in and interacting with its environment.
Researchers have used Bayesian geostatistical analysis to investigate the spread of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda. The study focused on two recently affected districts, Kaberamaido and Dokolo, and explored the relationship between HAT prevalence and various social, environmental, and climatic factors. The analysis revealed that the disease was likely introduced to the area through the movement of infected, untreated livestock from endemic areas. The study also found that health care accessibility and minimum land surface temperature had a significant impact on the spatial distribution of HAT. Using a Bayesian geostatistical model, the researchers were able to account for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty in input data and model parameters, resulting in more accurate parameter and significance estimates. Predictive mapping indicated an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of livestock trading in the continued spread of the disease. The study suggests that treating livestock at the point of sale is crucial to preventing the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda. The research demonstrates the utility of Bayesian geostatistical modeling in predicting HAT prevalence based on external covariates and provides a more robust evidence base for targeting control measures.
A long-held assumption in the field of ecology is that complex ecosystems are more stable than simple ones. However, a recent study challenges this idea by examining the feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems. Equilibrium refers to a state where the populations of different species in an ecosystem remain stable over time. The researchers found that in species-rich systems, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed. In fact, the probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially as the size of the network grows. This means that as ecosystems become more complex, it becomes increasingly unlikely for them to reach a stable state.

The study also explored how the strength of interactions between species affects the feasibility of equilibria. The researchers found that in systems with weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are only found in ecologically-inspired systems. This suggests that the structure and strength of interactions between species play a crucial role in determining the stability of ecosystems. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and highlight the need to consider the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture when studying complex systems. The results also suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires a more nuanced approach that takes into account the specific characteristics of each system, rather than relying on general assumptions about complexity and stability.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to investigate the sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium responsible for Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C. burnetii antibodies. The overall sero-prevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. However, there was no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or when accounting for spatial proximity between households.

Multilevel regression analysis revealed that several factors contributed to exposure to C. burnetii in both humans and cattle. Cattle obtained from markets and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had the highest sero-prevalence. In humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and variations were observed between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact, particularly grazing and dealing with abortion material, was also a risk factor for human exposure.

The study found that environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, but human exposure patterns are likely driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The analysis suggests that livestock markets may be a suitable target for interventions to reduce the risk of C. burnetii transmission. These findings highlight the importance of livestock contact in the transmission of C. burnetii and the need for targeted interventions to control the spread of Q fever in Western Kenya.
Researchers have identified three vasa-like DEAD-box RNA helicases in the genome of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. These helicases, Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3, are members of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily and are similar to the Vasa protein, a marker of primordial germ cells and the germ line in animals. The researchers found that these genes are expressed in various developmental stages of S. mansoni, including sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with high expression in the undeveloped egg. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 are transcribed in the posterior ovary, where oocytes mature.

The identification of these vasa-like genes provides a potential landmark for germ line transgenesis of schistosomes, which could aid in the development of novel anti-schistosomal interventions. The researchers suggest that these genes could be used as markers to monitor the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome germ line. However, the pattern of expression may impact the potential use of vasa-like genes as markers for germ cell identification and transformation. The study highlights the importance of functional genomic approaches to identify the role and importance of schistosome genes, which could lead to the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis.
Researchers have identified a critical role for VGLL4 in the development and maintenance of heart valves. Heart valve disease is a significant clinical problem worldwide, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of valve development and homeostasis is essential for developing effective treatments. The Hippo signaling pathway is known to play a crucial role in organ development and tissue homeostasis, but its role in valve formation and morphology maintenance was previously unknown. This study found that VGLL4, a transcription cofactor in vertebrates, is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells during post-embryonic development and is maintained in adult valves. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells leads to valve malformation and abnormal valve morphology. Further studies showed that semi-knockout of YAP, a key component of the Hippo pathway, rescued the valve malformation induced by VGLL4 deletion. These findings suggest that VGLL4 is essential for proper heart valve remodeling and maturation, and that manipulation of the Hippo pathway may be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease. The study also identified a previously unknown function of VGLL4 in valve remodeling and homeostasis, and suggests that mutations in VGLL4 may underlie human congenital heart valve dysplasia.
Recent studies have suggested that soft selective sweeps, a type of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation, are pervasive across different organisms, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, other researchers have questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. To reconcile these opposing results, three recent studies were evaluated using population genetic theory and extensive simulation. The analysis found that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps were found to be a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genomic variation. The study suggests that the lack of sufficient model testing and statistical performance analyses underlying previous claims of recurrent soft sweeps has led to inaccurate views of the evolutionary processes governing these organisms. The generalization of these results has resulted in misleading answers to long-standing questions in population genetics, with some suggesting a dominant role for positive selection in shaping patterns of genomic variation.
Researchers investigated the role of Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors (NPYLRs) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue fever. They identified eight NPYLRs in the Aedes aegypti genome and tested their response to a panel of peptides, including Head Peptide-I, a candidate peptide that inhibits host-seeking behavior after a blood meal. Four NPYLRs responded to one or more peptides, but only NPYLR1 was sensitive to Head Peptide-I and short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs). Two NPYLR1 homologues in the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, also responded to Head Peptide-I. Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes. To determine if NPYLR1 is necessary for blood-feeding-induced host-seeking inhibition, researchers generated npylr1 null mutant strains using zinc-finger nucleases. However, npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in various tests, suggesting that NPYLR1 alone is not required for host-seeking inhibition. The study identified NPYLR1 as a candidate sNPF receptor that responds to Head Peptide-I, but other receptors, additional peptides, or both may regulate this behavior.
Researchers used satellite-derived environmental data to model the risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, is influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land surface temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. The study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission using multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Saaty's analytical hierarchy process (AHP). AHP was used to assign weights to individual risk factors, including temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover. The weighted overlay analysis identified areas vulnerable to schistosomiasis transmission.

The study found that 82% of the area falls under high and very high risk categories, with one community (Oba Ile) having the lowest risk and four other communities (Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese) having increased risk. The predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from field studies, and the high-risk zones corresponded to known endemic communities. The study suggests that environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schistosomiasis transmission and monitor disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities. The combination of remote sensing and geographical information system-based spatial analyses can be used to determine disease distribution, understand disease ecology and epidemiology, and support prevention, surveillance, and control efforts. The study confirms that satellite-derived environmental data can be used to determine schistosomiasis risk levels in an area using relevant techniques.
Bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal meningitis) is a serious infection of the brain that can lead to long-term disabilities and cognitive impairments in survivors. A key factor in the neuropathogenic potential of pneumococci is the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin. Research has shown that pneumolysin plays a significant role in disrupting the regulation of glutamate in the brain, leading to synaptic damage.

Studies of post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis revealed selective synaptic loss in the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex. A similar effect was observed in mice with pneumococcal meningitis when the bacteria expressed pneumolysin. Exposure of mouse brain slices to non-lytic concentrations of pneumolysin caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduced this pathology.

Pneumolysin was found to increase glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices and initiate the release of glutamate from astrocytes in a calcium-dependent manner. The study suggests that pneumolysin plays a significant role in pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. This research provides new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis and highlights the importance of pneumolysin in disrupting the regulation of glutamate in the brain.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a major cause of human cancers, and understanding their infectious life cycle is crucial for developing new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides. Researchers have long known that HPVs infect the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but the reason for this specific location was unclear. A new study used chemical biology approaches to investigate the relationship between cell cycle progression and HPV infection. The study found that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection to take place. Using infectious HPV16 particles and human keratinocytes as hosts, the researchers discovered that the recipient cell must enter the M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to occur. Inhibitors of the G1, S, G2, and early M phases of the cell cycle prevented infection, while late M phase inhibitors had no effect. The study suggests that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. This finding provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, where cells are actively dividing. The study's results have important implications for HPV control, as they define a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection. Further research is needed to confirm the physiologic relevance of these findings in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. The study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNAs in both mycelial and yeast phases of the fungus. The results revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in the mycelial phase and 7 in the yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins, and the gene qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 is more closely related to homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp.

Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in the mycelial phase. The biogenesis of both milRNAs was found to be dependent on dcl-2, but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The study also showed that the mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in a knockdown strain, supporting the regulatory function of milRNAs. These findings provide the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and the possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.
Researchers studied the ability of two types of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, to transmit the Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Pacific region. These mosquitoes are potential vectors of the virus, which caused a significant outbreak in the region between 2013 and 2017. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the vector competence of wild populations of these mosquitoes from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated during the outbreak.

The researchers collected mosquitoes from three Aedes aegypti populations and two Aedes polynesiensis populations from the Pacific region and exposed them to the ZIKV strain. They analyzed the mosquitoes for infection, dissemination, transmission rates, and transmission efficiency at different time points after infection. The results showed that the infection rates were heterogeneous among the Aedes aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous. In contrast, the infection rates were less heterogeneous among the Aedes polynesiensis populations.

The transmission rates and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV among the different Aedes vector populations studied. The study found that both Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis had a low ability to transmit the virus. The results suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, and the large immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the outbreak.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Targeted Structure-Seq to study the structure of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cells. LncRNAs, such as the Xist RNA, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the inactivation of the X chromosome in mammalian cells. Understanding the structure of these RNAs is essential for understanding their function, evolution, and modularity.

Targeted Structure-Seq combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. This approach allows for high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads, making it a targeted and scalable method for analyzing RNA conformation in cells. The researchers used Targeted Structure-Seq to study the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5'-end of Xist.

The analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. The repeat A region of Xist is a functional element important for gene repression. The researchers validated the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect that this approach will be useful for advancing the mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs. The data obtained from Targeted Structure-Seq can be used to develop a conformational model of full-length Xist.
A new statistical framework has been developed to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases. The framework connects various predictive indices, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, and the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk. The framework also allows for the construction of graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve.

The framework is based on the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability (or heritability) explained by the genetic variants. This allows for the estimation of various prediction metrics, including AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, and the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk. The results from simulations match well with theoretical estimates.

The framework is applied to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait. The study highlights the importance of complementing AUC with other measures, such as net reclassification improvement and risk distribution plots, to achieve a more comprehensive assessment of prediction model performance. This is particularly relevant when established risk thresholds exist, as a large part of the ROC curve may be derived from cutoff points not of clinical interest.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), using recombinant antigens. The new test, SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, was compared to a traditional RDT using native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) in a study involving 57,632 individuals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The results showed that SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity, detecting 71.2% of HAT cases, followed by CATT (62.5%) and SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). CATT was the most specific test, with a specificity of 99.2%, while SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had specificities of 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. Combining two or three tests significantly increased sensitivity, with a combination of SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 achieving a sensitivity of 98.4% in passive screening and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was as sensitive as CATT but slightly less specific. The study suggests that using multiple tests can enhance the sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms for HAT, but may also decrease specificity.
Researchers conducted a 15-year study in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, to evaluate the effectiveness of Chagas disease vector control activities. Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease, has been effectively controlled in most of Guatemala, but some areas, like Comapa, continue to experience persistent infestation with the disease-carrying insect, Triatoma dimidiata. The study found that after multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS), the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% in 2001-2002 to 27% in 2011. Household construction materials alone predicted less than 10% of infested houses. The seroprevalence of Chagas disease in school-aged children declined by 10-fold, from 10% in 1999 to 1% in 2015. However, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remains above 10%. Despite a decade of vector control activities, the continued risk of vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. The study suggests that systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation.
Researchers have found that Citrobacter rodentium, a pathogen that causes disease in mice, has a highly unstable genome. This instability is due to large-scale genome recombination and the active movement of mobile genetic elements, such as prophages. A study sequenced an additional strain of C. rodentium, EX-33, and compared it to the previously sequenced strain ICC168. The results showed that ICC168 is representative of the species and that many inactivating mutations are common to both strains, suggesting they occurred early in the pathogen's evolution.

The genome of C. rodentium displays characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen, including a large number of pseudogenes and IS elements. The pathogen's virulence strategy is similar to that of human pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). C. rodentium is widely used as a model for studying these human pathogens.

The study's findings suggest that C. rodentium may have emerged as a significant pathogen alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The pathogen's instability is likely due to its recent evolution and adaptation to its new lifestyle. The study's results draw parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens and highlight the importance of mobile genetic elements in shaping the genome of C. rodentium.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochasticity in gene expression, which refers to the random fluctuations in protein levels across cell populations. Despite numerous theoretical models explaining these fluctuations, there was a lack of a robust and assumption-free approach to infer the underlying molecular mechanisms. The new method infers sets of biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein expression distributions. By deriving analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, the researchers found that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions. An efficient algorithm was developed to infer gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. Using this algorithm, the researchers found that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets, but the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanism. The method was able to distinguish between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs and regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. The framework developed here will be a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression. The method was able to obtain estimates of individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants in 91% of tested cases, and identified all underlying rate constants in some cases.
Researchers have developed a new vaccination strategy to protect against monkeypox virus (MPXV), a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals in tropical regions of Africa. The strategy uses three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins. These vectors, BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK, and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK, were tested in STAT1 knockout mice, which are highly susceptible to MPXV infection. The results showed that the BoHV-4 vectors were safe and effective in protecting the mice against lethal MPXV challenge. Specifically, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with the other two vectors provided 100% and 80% protection against mortality and morbidity, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of BoHV-4-based vectors as a vaccine platform against MPXV. The findings are significant, given the lack of FDA-approved therapies against MPXV and the limitations of current vaccines due to safety concerns. The use of BoHV-4 vectors could provide a safer and more effective alternative for protecting against MPXV, particularly in areas where the virus is endemic.
Researchers have identified a novel mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes, a type of single-celled parasite. The enzyme, called ALPH1, is an ApaH-like phosphatase that plays a crucial role in the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes do not have a traditional decapping complex, but instead use ALPH1 to remove the cap from deadenylated mRNAs. This process is essential for the degradation of mRNAs by the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRNA. Depletion of ALPH1 in trypanosomes leads to a massive accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs that have not yet started degradation, indicating that ALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation. In vitro experiments confirm that ALPH1 is capable of decapping mRNAs, but with a unique mechanism that leaves more than one phosphate group at the 5' end of the mRNA. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a class of enzymes found in all branches of the eukaryotic kingdom. The discovery of ALPH1 as a decapping enzyme provides new insights into the mRNA degradation pathway in trypanosomes and highlights the unique features of this pathway compared to other eukaryotes.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, can trigger their conversion into insulin-producing β-like cells. This process, known as neogenesis, can occur at any age and is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass, potentially reversing diabetes. The study used a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to investigate the role of Arx in α-cell development and function. The results show that the loss of Arx in α-cells leads to the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, resulting in the generation of glucagon+ cells that can be converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. The study also found that Pax4, a gene previously shown to induce β-cell neogenesis, is dispensable for this process, indicating that Arx is the main trigger of α-cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis. Importantly, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. The findings suggest that strategies aimed at inhibiting the expression of Arx or its molecular targets/co-factors may provide new avenues for the treatment of diabetes. The study provides evidence that the sole loss of the Arx gene in α-cells can initiate a continuous cycle of glucagon+ cell neo-formation and their conversion into β-like cells, leading to islet hypertrophy due to β-like cell hyperplasia.
Eukaryotic cells have thousands of replication origins in their genome, and re-initiation of DNA replication at these origins can lead to genomic alterations. To prevent re-initiation, cells use multiple regulatory mechanisms that reduce the activity of replication initiation proteins. However, it has been observed that origins re-initiate with varying efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, suggesting an additional layer of control that can differentially regulate re-initiation at distinct origins.

Researchers have identified novel genetic elements, called re-initiation promoters (RIPs), that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of certain origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These elements map to approximately 60 base pair AT-rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. The RIPs do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, indicating that they specifically act as re-initiation promoters.

The study found that Mcm2-7, a critical component of the replication initiation complex, reassociates with origins that preferentially re-initiate and those that do not, suggesting that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after Mcm2-7 associates with origins. This local level of control creates a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential, which is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-replication are compromised. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic replication origins and suggest that some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to genomic alterations than others.
Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant health concern, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1. A study of 170 HIV-1-infected Japanese men with IA found that the clinical presentation of the disease was similar to that in non-HIV-1-infected individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, and three died from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases, with no significant difference in outcome compared to non-HIV-1-infected patients.

The study also found that luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment did not reduce the recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, likely due to re-infection. Recurrence was more frequent in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and those who acquired syphilis during follow-up. Genotyping of E. histolytica was performed in 14 patients, but no correlation was found between genotype and clinical features. The study suggests that metronidazole or tinidazole treatment is effective for uncomplicated amebiasis in HIV-1-infected individuals, but luminal treatment may not be necessary to prevent recurrence. The findings highlight the need for educational approaches to prevent new amebic infections in high-risk groups, such as HIV-1-infected MSM.
Researchers conducted a study in the Mandoul area of Chad to assess the effectiveness of adding tsetse control to medical activities in reducing the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and is transmitted by riverine tsetse flies. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of deploying "tiny targets" that attract and kill tsetse flies on the incidence of HAT in the area. The targets were deployed in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and their effectiveness was assessed through nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015.

The results showed that the deployment of tiny targets significantly reduced the number of tsetse flies in the area, from a mean catch of 0.7 flies/trap/day to 0.005 tsetse/trap/day. Mathematical modeling indicated that 70.4% of the reduction in reported HAT cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, with the remaining 29.6% due to medical intervention. The study also estimated that tiny targets reduced new infections by 62.8%, with 8.5% of the reduction due to enhanced passive detection.

The study suggests that the combination of tsetse control and medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in the Mandoul area. Model predictions anticipate that elimination of HAT as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 if vector control and screening continue at the present level.
A study of 1245 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain from 2009 to 2017 found that most patients were immigrants from South America, with 66.9% of cases originating from this region. The majority of patients were asymptomatic, but 82.2% had eosinophilia, a condition characterized by high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. The parasite was detected in stool samples in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests were used to diagnose the remaining cases. Treatment with ivermectin was found to be more effective than albendazole in achieving a cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study suggests that screening for Strongyloides stercoralis infection should be mandatory for patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, particularly those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation. The findings of this study contradict those of a previous study in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which found that ivermectin treatment was not effective in all patients. The study highlights the need for a combination of diagnostic techniques, including classical parasitological methods, serology, and PCR, to accurately diagnose strongyloidiasis.
Researchers have explored the relationship between the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used in a vaccine, known as the inoculum dose, and its impact on host immunity and morbidity. A higher inoculum dose can stimulate a stronger immune response, but may also cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. To determine the optimal inoculum dose, a combination of mathematical models and experimental data can be used. A study used a mathematical model to analyze data from mice infected with influenza A virus and cotton rats infected with human parainfluenza virus at different inoculum doses. The model was used to map the inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity. The results showed that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen, and that protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase with increasing inoculum dose. A framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. This framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum. The study's findings suggest that a systematic and quantitative approach can be used to determine the impact of different inoculum doses on immune protection and morbidity, and can lead to important insights, such as the fact that more inoculum does not always lead to more immune protection.
Researchers studied the expression of the hetR gene in Anabaena filaments, a cyanobacterium that undergoes a process of development in response to nitrogen deprivation. The hetR gene is essential for the formation of heterocysts, specialized cells that fix nitrogen. The study used a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion to track hetR expression in individual cells along the filament. Statistical analysis revealed that hetR expression fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of two to three cells. This coupling is primarily due to intercellular molecular transfer, rather than cell division.

Under nitrogen-rich conditions, the study found that basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments. The study also compared the expression of hetR-gfp under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions, highlighting the differences between the HetR inhibitors PatS and HetN, as well as the septal proteins SepJ and FraC/FraD.

The results show that proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell-cell communication combine to control the coupled fluctuations of gene expression that give rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in Anabaena. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of heterocysts in Anabaena filaments and highlights the importance of spatial correlations in gene expression in multicellular organisms.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) has become the dominant strain in China, replacing genotype III (GIII), according to molecular epidemiological surveillance. A serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs confirmed the genotype shift, with an average ratio of GI to GIII infections of 1.87. To understand the reasons behind this shift, researchers compared the replication kinetics of seven JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, in different cell types. The results showed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1) and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC), with titers reaching 22.9-225.3 fold higher than GIII strains. This enhanced replication efficiency in avian cells was also observed in vivo, where young domestic ducklings inoculated with GI strains developed higher viremia titers and longer viremic duration compared to those inoculated with GIII strains. The 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII viruses may be responsible for the enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in birds. These findings suggest that the increased replication of GI viruses in birds could lead to higher exposure and transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle, contributing to the JEV genotype shift.
Researchers studied the genetic network that regulates biofilm formation in Candida albicans, a type of fungus that can cause infections. The network consists of six transcription factors (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) that work together to control biofilm formation. To understand how these factors interact, the researchers created all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and analyzed their effects on biofilm formation. The results showed that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbations, with all six heterozygous mutants affecting biofilm formation. Many double heterozygous mutants were as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent. The researchers found that the network has properties of a "small-world" network, which is efficient but not robust. They also discovered that Tec1 is a key component of the network that is sensitive to small perturbations, and that Rob1's expression is dependent on both auto-regulation and interactions with other transcription factors. Additionally, the researchers found that the Ndt80 deletion mutant is hyperfilamentous under certain conditions, in a Tec1-dependent manner. Overall, the study provides new insights into the functions of individual transcription factors and the role of the network topology in regulating biofilm formation in Candida albicans.
Researchers investigated the role of asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. AS-A is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine, an essential amino acid, using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. This enzyme is absent in humans but present in trypanosomatids, a group of parasites that includes Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Previous studies suggested that AS-A is essential for the survival of Leishmania donovani, making it a potential target for drug development.

However, the current study found that Leishmania infantum AS-A (LiAS-A) is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. The researchers generated LiAS-A null mutants by targeted gene replacement in L. infantum and found that these parasites did not display any significant growth or infectivity defects. Only when cultured in asparagine-limiting conditions did the null mutants show a severe impairment of in vitro growth.

These findings suggest that AS-A is not a suitable drug target against L. infantum parasites. The study also highlights the differences in asparagine metabolism between Leishmania and Trypanosoma species, which may have implications for the development of targeted therapies against these parasites. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the role of AS-A in Leishmania infantum and its potential as a drug target.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy. The review included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries, involving a total of 4740 subjects, including 2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 without epilepsy. The analysis found a significant positive association between Toxocara spp. seropositivity and epilepsy, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01). This association was consistently reported in restricted analyses, including studies that used Western Blot as a confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger populations, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The results provide epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy, supported by new surveys, particularly population-based studies. The findings suggest that health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp. are warranted. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis.
Researchers have identified a new pathway in cells that helps them respond to DNA damage. This pathway involves a protein called ATM, which is activated when DNA double-strand breaks occur. ATM triggers the downregulation of a microRNA called miR-335, which in turn targets a protein called CtIP. CtIP plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA damage through a process called homologous recombination repair (HRR). The study found that when miR-335 is overexpressed, it reduces the levels of CtIP, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to radiation. Conversely, when miR-335 is downregulated, CtIP levels increase, allowing for more efficient DNA repair.

The researchers also discovered that a protein called CREB is responsible for regulating miR-335 expression. When DNA damage occurs, CREB is phosphorylated by ATM, reducing its activity and leading to the downregulation of miR-335. This suggests that the ATM-CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis plays a critical role in the DNA damage response. The study found that cells with elevated miR-335 expression were more sensitive to radiation and had impaired DNA repair, while cells with reduced miR-335 expression were more resistant to radiation and had improved DNA repair. These findings suggest that the ATM-CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis is a key regulator of the DNA damage response and may have implications for understanding how cells respond to radiation and other forms of DNA damage.
Researchers investigated how mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, affects learning in social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial agents that differed in their mentalizing sophistication. The study found that when participants believed they were playing against another person, they won against the sophisticated agents, but lost when they thought they were playing a casino game. This suggests that mentalizing plays a crucial role in learning in social contexts. The study also found that participants' choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only when they believed they were playing against another person. This is the first demonstration of the added value of mentalizing on learning in repeated social interactions. The results show that attributing mental states to others is essential for deciphering intentional behavior. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that learning in social contexts relies on specific cognitive processes, such as predicting others' behavior. The researchers propose the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which suggests that our brain assumes others are also Bayesian learners, and that mentalizing involves updating recursive beliefs from observing others' behavior. The study's results support this hypothesis and highlight the importance of mentalizing in social interactions.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGGM to efficiently infer Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) in biological networks. GGMs are statistical models that describe the relationships between variables in a network, such as gene or protein interactions. Traditional methods for inferring GGMs can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for large-scale biological data. The new algorithm, FastGGM, addresses these limitations by providing a faster and more efficient method for estimating GGMs and obtaining p-values and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph. Through simulation studies, the researchers demonstrated that FastGGM is several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods without compromising accuracy. The algorithm was applied to two real-world datasets: transcriptomic data from a childhood asthma study and proteomic data from an Alzheimer's disease study. The resulting networks revealed interesting interactions and highlighted functional relevance to the diseases. The differential networks between cases and controls showed significant differences in gene or protein interactions between healthy and diseased samples. FastGGM has been implemented in an R package, making it a valuable tool for researchers to study large-scale biological networks using GGMs. The algorithm provides a statistically sound procedure for constructing GGMs and making inferences with high-dimensional biological data, enabling the analysis of complex biological systems at a whole-genome scale.
Researchers investigated how the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network, a key component of the basal ganglia, responds to variations in cortical driving activity. They found that the network's population activity varies coherently on slow, behaviorally relevant timescales, which is essential for learning and executing movement sequences. A model of the local MSN network showed that this activity emerges only at realistic connectivity levels and when inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) are of realistic size.

The study examined how MSN network-generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity. At high connectivity levels, the network enters a stable "winners-take-all" regime, where activity separates into fixed, stimulus-dependent firing and quiescent components. However, at lower connectivity levels, the network transitions to a more dynamically active regime, where cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence.

In this regime, MSN population components wander randomly and are independent of cortical driving variations. However, at the transition point between these regimes, weak changes in cortical driving interact with many population components, leading to the reproducible activation of sequential cell assemblies for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. This activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes.

The study suggests that the local MSN network has optimal characteristics, neither too stable nor too unstable, allowing it to generate stimulus-dependent activity patterns for extended periods after variations in cortical excitation.
Researchers have discovered a new link between polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast cells. Polarized exocytosis transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, while endocytosis retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. The study found that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p couples polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis, Sec4p binds to Las17/Bee1p, a protein involved in actin patch assembly, in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays showed that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. The results suggest that Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis. This process controls surface expansion and refines cell polarization.
Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for studying drug-induced liver injury in humans. To develop effective strategies to prevent or reverse liver damage, a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms is crucial. Researchers have proposed the NAPQI zonation hypothesis, which suggests that location-dependent differences in the formation of the reactive metabolite NAPQI within hepatic lobules are necessary and sufficient to explain the phenomenon of necrosis beginning adjacent to the central vein and progressing outward. However, challenging this hypothesis in mice is challenging due to the difficulty in controlling influential variables and obtaining sequential intracellular measurements at different lobular locations within the same mouse.

To overcome this limitation, researchers used virtual hepatocytes to simulate the behavior of liver cells in response to acetaminophen. These virtual cells were configured to exhibit location-dependent behaviors based on periportal-to-central vein gradients. The results of these virtual experiments showed that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is insufficient to explain early perivenous necrosis. By incorporating additional features, such as a glutathione depletion threshold and the ability to repair mitochondrial damage, which both decrease in the central vein direction, the researchers were able to successfully replicate the phenomenon of necrosis beginning adjacent to the central vein and progressing outward. This merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale explanation of key temporal features of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice and offers a plausible explanation for the variation in necrosis scores among genetically diverse mouse strains.
Researchers studied the early diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in children born to infected mothers. They analyzed blood samples from 51 congenitally infected children at three different times: one month, six months, and one year after birth. The study aimed to understand why not all newborns can be diagnosed immediately after birth using a conventional method called INP micromethod.

The results showed that only children with high levels of parasitemia (parasite DNA in the blood) could be diagnosed by INP micromethod at one month of age. Children who required a second parasitological diagnosis at six months of age had lower parasitemia levels, and those diagnosed by serology (blood test) at one year of age had the lowest parasitemia levels. The study found that 22 out of 51 children had parasitemia levels below the detection limit of the INP micromethod.

The researchers isolated T. cruzi parasites from 19 children and genotyped them, finding that 18 belonged to the DTU TcV lineage and one to the TcI lineage. The study highlights the need for more sensitive parasitological methods to ensure early diagnosis and effective treatment of congenitally infected children. The current trypanocidal treatment is effective in curing infected children, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent long-term complications. The study's findings suggest that quantitative DNA amplification methods may be necessary to improve the early diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in newborns.
A biophysical model of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been developed to predict growth rate and cellular composition from a simplified representation of its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential growth in a constant environment with abundant resources. The model was applied to measurements of growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio in seven E. coli strains with varying rRNA operon copy numbers, ranging from one to seven. The results showed that growth rate decreased for strains with fewer than six copies. The model was able to reproduce these measurements and suggested that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. The model also predicted that increasing the copy number beyond seven would result in a densely packed cytoplasm, which would weaken binding affinities and not significantly increase growth rate. This prediction is consistent with other experiments. The model suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. The model's predictions are also consistent with observations regarding nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response in strains with altered rRNA operon copy numbers.
Researchers have identified a protein called RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1) in Arabidopsis plants that plays a crucial role in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. ABA is a hormone that helps plants respond to stress, while salinity refers to high levels of salt in the soil. The study found that altering the expression of RSM1 changes the sensitivity of seed germination and seedling growth to ABA and salinity. The researchers also discovered that RSM1 interacts with two other proteins, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH), which regulate RSM1 expression. This interaction suggests that RSM1 and HY5/HYH form a regulatory module that helps plants respond to ABA and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, the study found that RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), a gene involved in ABA signaling, and stimulates the binding of HY5 to the ABI5 promoter. This suggests that RSM1 and HY5/HYH may converge on the ABI5 promoter to regulate its expression and the expression of downstream genes involved in ABA and abiotic stress responses. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to stress and ABA signaling, and highlight the importance of RSM1 and HY5/HYH in plant adaptation to the environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump in the respiratory chain, plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. It links electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. Defects in complex I have been linked to various degenerative disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and biological aging. Recent X-ray structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I revealed that redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm, far from the membrane domain. This suggests that proton pumping in the membrane arm is driven indirectly through long-range conformational coupling. However, the molecular mechanism and the number, identity, and localization of the pump sites remain unclear.

Researchers have identified a stable subcomplex of complex I, called nb8mΔ, which lacks the distal part of the membrane domain. Analysis of the subunit composition of holo and subcomplex revealed that two subunits, ND4 and ND5, which have homology to bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters, are missing in nb8mΔ. Despite this, nb8mΔ still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. These findings suggest that the membrane arm of complex I contains two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a long helical transmission element. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanism of proton pumping in complex I and has implications for understanding the molecular basis of complex I-related diseases.
Researchers investigated how fever affects the binding of antibodies to antigens from malarial and dengue viruses. They used a laboratory technique called Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to study the interaction between antibodies and antigens at different temperatures, including 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. The results showed that at 40°C, the antibodies bound more strongly to the antigens compared to 37°C or 42°C. The researchers also found that allowing the proteins to equilibrate at these temperatures before measuring their interaction increased their binding affinity. This suggests that fever may play a role in enhancing the immune system's ability to fight off infections by increasing the binding of antibodies to antigens. The study's findings have implications for the development of diagnostic tests and treatments for diseases caused by malarial and dengue viruses. Additionally, the results suggest that thermal priming, or allowing proteins to equilibrate at different temperatures, may improve the accuracy of laboratory tests that rely on protein-protein interactions. This could be particularly useful in cases where limited amounts of sample are available. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of fever in modulating the immune response and highlights the potential benefits of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein interactions.
Researchers have studied how actomyosin-based cortical flow, a fundamental process in cellular morphogenesis, is controlled by local remodeling of cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors. Cortical flows are generated by active stress produced by motor activity, which is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation. To understand how local remodeling tunes stress production and dissipation, a computational model was developed based on minimal requirements for contractile stress production and dissipation. The model included asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover.

The study found that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady-state flow in response to external stress. Steady-state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time (τm), then decreases with lifetime above τm. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time (τc), and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on cross-link dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady-state flow. When filament lifetimes are shorter than both τc and τm, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady-state stress on filament turnover cancel each other, resulting in a simple dependence of flow speed on motor activity and cross-link dynamics.

The study provides a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling. The findings suggest that local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks in vitro, supporting a mechanism based on asymmetrical filament compliance and filament buckling.
Researchers identified a genetic locus, GSQ11, in Arabidopsis thaliana that allows seedlings to grow on media containing high levels of glucose or fructose. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis mapped GSQ11 to the ANAC060 gene, which encodes a transcription factor. The Col-0 allele of ANAC060 confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Col-0 allele affects the splicing pattern of ANAC060, resulting in a truncated protein lacking a transmembrane domain (TMD). This truncated protein is localized to the nucleus, where it attenuates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABA signaling is a key pathway involved in sugar sensing and response. The researchers found that ABI4, a transcription factor involved in ABA signaling, directly binds to the ANAC060 promoter to activate its expression. However, the truncated Col-0 ANAC060 protein reduces ABA sensitivity and ABI4 expression, leading to sugar insensitivity. This negative feedback loop between ANAC060 and ABA signaling allows seedlings to grow on high-sugar media. The study highlights the complex interactions between sugar sensing and ABA signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls its behavior, specifically its ability to form biofilms and move. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces, while motility refers to the ability of bacteria to move. The researchers found that a protein called HsbD, which synthesizes a molecule called cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), interacts with the HptB regulatory pathway to control biofilm formation and motility. The HptB pathway is a network of proteins that regulates various behaviors in P. aeruginosa, including biofilm formation, twitching, swimming, swarming motility, and chemotaxis.

The study shows that HsbD and another protein, SadC, contribute to the HptB-dependent regulation of biofilm formation, but have different effects on motility. The researchers propose that HsbD acts locally at the cell pole and that two c-di-GMP synthesizing enzymes, HsbD and SadC, intersect within the same regulatory network in a hierarchical order. The Gac/Rsm cascade, a global regulatory network, contributes to the high c-di-GMP regime necessary for P. aeruginosa biofilm formation.

The study reveals that the HptB pathway controls biofilm formation by reducing the levels of a small regulatory RNA called RsmY. The researchers also found that the interaction between HsbD and HsbA, an anti-anti-sigma factor, is crucial for the rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade. Overall, the study provides new insights into how P. aeruginosa controls its behavior and how c-di-GMP signaling is regulated in this bacterium.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, which are associations between visual cues and motor responses. In the study, participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while visual feedback was manipulated to require different visuomotor mappings depending on the target shape. The target shapes were morphed between spiky and circular shapes, and participants learned to associate each shape with a specific visuomotor mapping. After training, participants were tested on novel target shapes that had not been learned previously.

The results showed that participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one, consistent with a Bayesian learning model. This model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the results. The study found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results, suggesting that this model may be a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.

The study also found that participants were able to learn the association between previously irrelevant target shape cues and behaviorally relevant visuomotor mappings. The relationship between shape and visuomotor mappings was always linear, and participants were able to generalize this relationship to novel target shapes. The results suggest that humans can learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback is provided alternately, and that learned context cues associated with each mapping can be used to switch between the stored mappings.
Researchers investigated the relationship between climbing fiber bursts and olivary sub-threshold oscillations in the inferior olivary nucleus, a key input to the cerebellum. Climbing fibers transmit information about sensory events and motor commands to the cerebellum, and their activation leads to large action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells. A previous study suggested that the size of the climbing fiber burst is related to the phase of the olivary cell's sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. To further explore this relationship, a three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell was used. The results showed that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and that charge flow between the soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. The study also found that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can significantly affect the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. This suggests that the inferior olivary nucleus may be able to transmit more information per event than previously thought, potentially allowing for a coarse, low-resolution encoding of temporal information. The findings have implications for understanding the electrophysiological properties of the inferior olivary nucleus and its role in the cerebellar system.
Researchers have developed a computational model of liver iron metabolism to better understand how the body regulates iron levels. Iron is essential for life, but excessive levels can be toxic. The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining safe iron levels, and misregulation is linked to various diseases. A detailed map of iron metabolism has been created, but a quantitative understanding of how its components interact to produce tight regulation is still lacking. The new model includes the core regulatory components of liver iron metabolism and was constructed based on known mechanisms and kinetic properties. It was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. The model was used to simulate a time course of iron metabolism after an oral dose and recreated the dynamics and time scale of the system's response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was also created by altering a single reaction parameter, mimicking a human haemochromatosis gene mutation. This simulation provided a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. The model supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modeling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design experiments to improve knowledge of the system. This model is the most detailed quantitative mechanistic model of cellular iron metabolism to date, allowing for a comprehensive description of its regulation. It can be used to elucidate the link from genotype to phenotype, as demonstrated with hereditary haemochromatosis.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the process of molecular transport across the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a critical gateway for material exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The model, based on Brownian dynamics simulations, takes into account the hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and Phe-Gly (FG) repeat domains, which play a central role in the transport process. The model predicts that the first-passage time for a 15-nanometer cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 milliseconds, with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The simulations also show that the cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The model suggests that the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. Additionally, the simulations indicate that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport. The study also found that cytoplasmic filaments play a crucial role in the selectivity barrier of the NPC, as NPCs lacking these filaments show increased permeability to inert cargos. The model provides new insights into the molecular events occurring during nucleocytoplasmic transport and can be used as a foundation for future studies on this complex process.
Determining the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate (NHP) models is crucial for testing interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. A limiting dose challenge model, where only a fraction of animals become infected, is often used to minimize animal use and resources. However, finding the correct dose is challenging, as using too-high or too-low a dose can lead to false negative results or wasted resources.

To address this issue, a new protocol has been developed to determine the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time, known as the AID50. This protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources needed while providing an estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. The method involves iterative exposures of cohorts of animals to a dilution of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between each round to achieve 50% infection.

The protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but is most critical for NHP models due to ethical considerations. On average, the protocol requires 15 animals, 3 phase 1 rounds, and results in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. By following this protocol, investigators can efficiently determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for NHP models, reducing animal use and resource waste.
Researchers studied the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets to understand how sensory systems adapt to changes in their environment. They found that the AN2 neuron adapts to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli by shifting its response curve towards higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This means that the neuron's response to low-intensity sounds is reduced.

The researchers tested whether this adaptation improves the representation of the signal by comparing it to two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that the neuron should maximize the information conveyed about the entire signal range, while selective coding suggests that the neuron should enhance "foreground" signals and suppress "background" signals.

The study found that adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, contradicting the infomax principle. The response curve changes were also not consistent with selective coding, as the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal did not increase as predicted. Instead, less information was transmitted about signals with lower intensity.

The researchers used Bayesian data analysis to quantify the shifts of the measured response curves and found that the decreases in slopes were smaller and the absolute response thresholds were higher than those predicted by infomax. The study suggests that the adaptation mechanism in the AN2 neuron is more complex than previously thought and does not follow the principles of either infomax or selective coding.
Researchers have investigated the role of polybasic domains in the propagation of prions, misfolded proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies suggested that these domains on the cellular prion protein (PrPC) serve as docking sites for the disease-associated conformer (PrPSc). To examine this further, scientists created prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains and used them as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) reactions. They found that prions lacking the central polybasic domain (ΔC-PrPSc) could bind to and induce the conversion of other prion proteins into PrPSc molecules. However, these ΔC-PrPSc prions displayed reduced or no biological infectivity compared to wild-type PrPSc, despite their ability to seed sPMCA reactions in normal mouse brain homogenate. This suggests that ΔC-PrPSc interacts with PrPC molecules through a novel interaction mechanism, allowing for efficient PrPSc propagation and an expanded substrate range. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a dissociation between the ability of prions to seed sPMCA reactions and their biological infectivity. The results indicate that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism, and that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity.
Researchers have developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from behavioral time-series data. This framework was applied to study the thermotactic behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a type of nematode worm. The study found that fed worms use both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to control their behavior, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM allows worms to efficiently reach specific temperatures, while IM enables them to move along a constant temperature. In contrast, starved worms use only the absolute temperature to avoid the cultivation temperature. The researchers also investigated the neural basis of these strategies by applying the IRL framework to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. The results suggest that the IRL-based approach is useful for identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and can be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the IRL framework in uncovering the underlying mechanisms of animal behavior, providing new insights into the decision-making processes of C. elegans.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrysochromulina tobin, a type of haptophyte algae, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour light-dark cycle. Haptophytes play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to carbon sequestration, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms. Despite their importance, the nuclear genome of only one haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi, has been previously sequenced.

The Chrysochromulina tobin genome is small, compact, and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the circadian photoperiod. The genome also harbors a unique hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. Additionally, a new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin and two "red" RuBisCO activases were identified, which are shared across many algal lineages.

The Chrysochromulina tobin genome provides new insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. Genomic knowledge of haptophytes can enhance commercial endeavors such as aquaculture feed stocks, nutraceuticals, plastics, and biofuel production. Furthermore, understanding the fundamental metabolic processes of haptophytes can support efforts to mitigate the impact of harmful algal blooms. This study contributes to the growing body of research on haptophytes, a group of algae that play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems.
Researchers studied the role of three tumor suppressor genes, Rb, Brca1, and p53, in the development of triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that lacks the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2, and is often associated with the Basal-like molecular subtype. The study found that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the natural process of cell death in the mammary gland, leading to the formation of tumors. When all three pathways were inactivated, the tumors developed more quickly and were more aggressive, with characteristics similar to those found in human Brca1-mutated tumors, such as heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analysis revealed that the tumors shared attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer.

The study used mouse models to mimic the complexity of triple-negative breast cancer and found that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways had an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposed highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas. The researchers also observed that Brca1 inactivation accelerated tumorigenesis, but did not affect the number of chromosomal copy number transitions in tumors. The study suggests that mouse models that mimic the complexity of triple-negative breast cancer will be valuable tools for understanding the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for testing new drug candidates.
Researchers studied the population dynamics of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. They conducted pupal surveys from 2004 to 2007, collecting 84,840 samples of water-holding containers to estimate model parameters. Regression modeling was used to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity.

The study found that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. A two-part modeling structure, called a hurdle model, was employed to account for the large number of zeroes and overdispersion present in pupal population counts.

The results suggest that an ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is appropriate for predicting Aedes aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs. The study highlights the importance of considering the spatial density of larval development sites in controlling Aedes aegypti populations, which is often overlooked in previous studies. The findings have implications for the design of effective vector interventions and the development of sustainable vector control programs.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism by which the gut communicates with the brain to regulate behavior and development in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in integrating information about food quality and quantity with external cues such as temperature and pheromones. TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate the expression of two key genes, daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide, which reflect the worm's feeding status. This information is then transmitted to the brain, influencing the worm's decision to enter a dormant state called the dauer larval stage or to continue growing and reproducing. The study also found that TORC2 is involved in regulating adult foraging behavior, with the intestine acting as a hub for communication between the gut and the brain. Genetic variation was found to affect food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits were identified. The results suggest that TORC2 acts as a key mediator of gut-to-brain signaling, allowing the worm to adapt its behavior and development in response to changes in its environment and feeding status. This research provides new insights into the complex interactions between the gut, brain, and environment in regulating behavior and development.
Researchers have identified clusters of genes that are upregulated in pluripotent cells, including embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells. These genes are involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, was developed to systematically predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. CompMoby combines analyses of aligned and non-aligned sequences between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model. The algorithm identified conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, which are preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells. These motifs can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter and are conserved in human ES cells. The transcription factor NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. The study provides insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species. The findings have implications for understanding early mammalian embryogenesis and ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency.
Researchers have characterized the structure of a complex between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This complex is essential for the replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The study focused on a variant of N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) that encompasses the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P. The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form and was solved at 3.0 Å resolution.

The structure reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy confirmed the binding of the MoRE and indicated that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. NMR spectroscopy also showed that the MoRE of P binds to N in solution as in the crystal structure, and the regions of P flanking this MoRE remain flexible in the complex.

The study demonstrates that the reconstituted NΔ21-P60 complex is a suitable model for the viral N0-P complex. The crystal structure and NMR spectroscopy experiments show that the MoRE of P, which adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, includes residues 6 to 35 and corresponds closely to the fragment previously identified as essential and sufficient for maintaining N in a soluble form. The results provide insights into the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA and the initiation of RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase.
Researchers have investigated the role of gap junctions in the fly visual system, specifically in the vertical system network, which plays a key role in visual processing. Gap junctions are electrical synapses that allow for direct communication between neurons. The study found that the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the vertical system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation of the fly's ego motion within 10 milliseconds of visual input. This encoding efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it approaches the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input. The researchers also discovered that a subset of triplets of vertical system cells, connected by gap junctions, encodes motion more efficiently than the entire network and is robust to various signal-to-noise ratios. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. The study suggests that gap junctions only impact the system's readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, indicating that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be more complex than previously thought. The findings provide new insights into how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli and may encourage further exploration of gap junctions as a common mechanism for improving information transmission in other neuronal systems.
Researchers have identified tyrosine sulfation of the amino terminus of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as critical for Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. EV71 is a major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children and has been linked to severe neurological diseases. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin expressed on the surface of leukocytes that serves as a high-affinity counterreceptor for selectins and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. The interaction between PSGL-1 and EV71 requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines and an adjacent O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction, researchers generated a series of PSGL-1 mutants and identified the post-translational modifications critical for binding of PSGL-1 to EV71. They found that O-glycosylation on T57, which is critical for PSGL-1-selectin interaction, is not necessary for PSGL-1 binding to EV71. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis at one or more potential tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 significantly impaired PSGL-1 binding to EV71. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 facilitates virus entry and replication of EV71 in leukocytes.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in treating leishmaniasis, a serious global health problem. Leishmaniasis is caused by a parasite that affects millions of people worldwide, and current treatments have limitations due to toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains. The study tested three mTOR inhibitors - rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 - in a mouse model of leishmaniasis. The results showed that treatment with rapamycin or GSK-2126458 significantly reduced the parasite load and footpad swelling in infected mice, while KU-0063794 had no effect. Importantly, the treatment did not kill the parasites in vitro, suggesting that the benefits were due to immunomodulatory effects rather than direct antiparasitic activity. The study found that rapamycin treatment led to a shift in the immune response from a type 2 (Th2) to a type 1 (Th1) response, characterized by increased production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and reduced production of interleukin-4 (IL-4). This shift in immune response was associated with enhanced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The findings suggest that mTOR inhibitors, particularly rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be useful in treating leishmaniasis by modulating the immune response. The study proposes that these inhibitors could be used as adjuvants to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines against Leishmania species.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the process of natural transformation in Neisseria species, a widespread biological process where bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered. To prevent the uptake of foreign DNA, some bacteria preferentially take up their own DNA, which contains specific DNA uptake sequences (DUS) that serve as "watermarks." A recent study identified ComP as the receptor for DUS in Neisseria species, paving the way for a functional analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence.

The study found that ComP is essential for transformation, both in the presence and absence of DUS. The inner bases of DUS, specifically positions 7 to 10, are critical for recognition by ComP and subsequent transformation. Mutations in these positions resulted in impaired interaction with ComP and reduced transformation efficiency. Interestingly, naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals, which differ from the standard DUS by only one or two bases, were also impaired for transformation in Neisseria meningitidis.

The study also demonstrated that a ComP homolog from a commensal species specifically binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates DUS-enhanced transformation when expressed in a comP mutant of Neisseria meningitidis. This suggests that a similar mechanism is used by all Neisseria species to promote transformation by their own or closely related DNA. These findings provide new insights into the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
Researchers have identified a crucial interaction between two proteins, Pxl1 and Bgs1, in the process of cell division in fission yeast. Pxl1 is a protein that helps maintain the integrity of the contractile actomyosin ring (CAR), a structure essential for cell division, while Bgs1 is an enzyme responsible for synthesizing a key component of the cell wall, known as linear β(1,3) glucan. The study found that Pxl1 and Bgs1 work together to anchor the CAR to the plasma membrane and facilitate the formation of the cell wall septum. Without Pxl1 and Bgs1, the CAR fails to contract and the cell wall overgrows, preventing cell division. The researchers also discovered that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cell division and that this increase is dependent on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. Depletion of Bgs1 in cells with a defective Cdc15 SH3 domain leads to CAR disassembly and cell division blockage, similar to cells lacking Pxl1. The study suggests that Pxl1 and Cdc15 work together with Bgs1 to maintain CAR stability and septum formation during cell division. The researchers propose that Pxl1 may act as a mechanosensor that helps transform CAR contraction into an activation signal for the biosynthetic enzymes that form the septum. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the Pxl1-Bgs1 interaction in maintaining CAR integrity and septum formation during cell division in fission yeast.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, occurred in Bahrain in 2010 and 2011. To investigate the outbreak, researchers used high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing to analyze B. mallei isolates from infected horses and a camel. The results suggest that the outbreak was caused by two different B. mallei strains, indicating two independent introductions of the disease to the region. The strains from the Bahrain outbreak were found to be more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than to other B. mallei strains, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The close relationship between the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations may indicate a shared geographic origin that has yet to be identified. The recent emergence of glanders, combined with global horse trading, poses a new risk for human infections. The study's findings provide insight into the outbreak dynamics and natural genetic variability of B. mallei, which is not well understood due to the rarity of the disease. The results also highlight the importance of high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome analysis in understanding the epidemiology of B. mallei.
A study investigated the clinical and parasitological features of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) who did not respond to treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). The study included 43 patients from Colombia who had completed at least one round of treatment with Glucantime but experienced treatment failure or relapse. The majority of the patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite species commonly associated with ACL in Colombia.

The study found that 35% of the isolated parasites showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility after previous administration of the medication. Lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite were negatively correlated with a decline in Glucantime susceptibility. The study also found a negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance.

The results suggest that Leishmania braziliensis was the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse in patients who underwent treatment with Glucantime. The study's findings raise questions about the effectiveness of a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives for patients with ACL caused by L. braziliensis. The study's results may have implications for the treatment of ACL in Colombia, where L. braziliensis is a common cause of the disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore alternative treatment options for patients with ACL who do not respond to Glucantime.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and the genotoxin colibactin in Escherichia coli. Siderophores are small iron-scavenging molecules, while colibactin is a genotoxin that contributes to the virulence of E. coli. The production of both siderophores and colibactin requires a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). Two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been identified in E. coli, with EntD being part of the core genome and ClbA encoded on the pks pathogenicity island. The pks island is associated with the high pathogenicity island (HPI) in highly virulent E. coli strains. The researchers found that ClbA can contribute to the synthesis of siderophores, and inactivation of both EntD and ClbA abolished the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) in a mouse sepsis model. The presence of either functional EntD or ClbA was required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. This study demonstrates a connection between multiple phosphopantetheinyl-requiring pathways leading to the biosynthesis of functionally distinct secondary metabolites in E. coli. The findings suggest that the association of the pks island with HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model. This model accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, which are typically only considered in widely used phylogenetic models. The new model is based on a continuous Markov process and assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time.

The researchers applied this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. They used standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments to compare the performance of the extended program dnamlε with the usual approach of ignoring gaps. The results showed that dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.

The new model has the potential to integrate evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used for other sequence analysis problems, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). This could improve the accuracy of phylogenetic tree inference and other sequence analysis tasks. The model also has implications for understanding the evolution of single residues in a multiple alignment, given a phylogenetic tree. The total probability of the alignment is assumed to be an independent product of each column probability, allowing for efficient calculation using the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.
Researchers investigated how the immune system responds to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection in human skin. They found that Langerhans cells (LCs), a type of immune cell in the epidermis, are initially infected with HSV. These infected LCs then undergo a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and are taken up by dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the dermis, the layer of skin beneath the epidermis. The dermal DCs, specifically those expressing the marker BDCA3, take up the infected LCs and present the viral antigens to the immune system. This process, known as antigen presentation, is crucial for triggering an immune response against the virus.

The study used human skin samples, including foreskin explants and biopsies from genital herpes lesions, to observe the interaction between LCs and dermal DCs. The researchers found that infected LCs formed clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells, which are thought to be equivalent to murine CD103+ dermal DCs. The study also showed that LCs isolated from human skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken up by BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells.

The findings suggest that a viral antigen relay takes place between LCs and dermal DCs, where infected LCs are taken up by dermal DCs for subsequent antigen presentation. This process provides a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal HSV immunization, which could potentially prevent or treat HSV infections.
Researchers studied the behavior of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse macrophages infected with Leishmania parasites. PVs are membrane-bound compartments that form around the parasites, allowing them to survive and multiply inside the host cell. The study compared PV biogenesis in macrophages infected with two different species of Leishmania: Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis. Using a technique called multidimensional imaging, the researchers observed the formation and remodeling of PVs in live cells.

The study found that PVs formed by Leishmania major amastigotes were typically small and tight-fitting, while those formed by Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes were larger and more dynamic. The researchers observed three key features of PV biogenesis: the entry of a fluorescent probe called Lysotracker into tight-fitting PVs containing Leishmania major amastigotes, the decrease in the number of acidic vesicles in the host cell during PV fission or enlargement, and the remodeling of Leishmania amazonensis PVs after homotypic fusion.

The study also used a software-based method to quantify the number of acidic vesicles in the host cell and found that approximately 50 acidic vesicles were consumed during intracellular infection, contributing to the formation of Leishmania PVs. The researchers suggest that secondary lysosomes are the main source of membrane for PV biogenesis, and that the host cell's acidic vesicle reservoirs play a crucial role in this process. Overall, the study provides new insights into the dynamic behavior of PVs in Leishmania-infected macrophages and highlights the species-specific differences in PV biogenesis between Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis.
Researchers have discovered that chromatin structure plays a crucial role in regulating gene conversion, a process that maintains and alters genomic structure through homology-directed repair. Using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model, scientists investigated how chromatin structure contributes to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair. They found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin, indicating an open and accessible chromatin structure.

To directly demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, the researchers used a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 was tethered to the pseudo-Vλ donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array, leading to a change in the outcome of Vλ diversification, where nontemplated mutations predominated over templated mutations. This suggests that chromatin structure regulates homology-directed repair.

The study's findings have practical implications for gene therapy, as they indicate that permissive structure at the donor will be an important design parameter in developing donor genes for therapeutic applications. The researchers also found that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. These results provide new insights into the role of chromatin structure in regulating gene conversion and homologous recombination, and highlight the importance of considering chromatin structure in the development of gene therapy strategies.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior to meet the demands of a situation. Traditionally, it is believed that the cerebellum uses error information to guide motor learning. This error information is thought to come from the difference between the desired and actual behavior. The cerebellum's Purkinje cells, which mediate behavioral adjustments, undergo lasting changes in response to this error information. Olivary climbing fibers, which connect with Purkinje cells, are believed to transmit instant error information for synaptic modification, but not to contribute to error memory.

Research on monkeys in a saccadic learning paradigm challenges this concept. The study found a clear signature of the error at the time of its occurrence, as well as a reverberation of this signature later on, before a new manifestation of the behavior. This suggests that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in motor learning than previously thought.

Previous studies on short-term saccadic adaptation have produced findings that are not entirely compatible with the idea that climbing fibers only communicate instant errors. A recent study on short-term saccadic adaptation observed patterns of complex spikes that contradict this assumption. The study also found links between the firing of simple spikes and complex spikes in the context of motor learning, leading researchers to wonder if the observed effects on complex spikes might be secondary to error-related changes in simple spike discharge.

A random error saccadic adaptation paradigm was used to avoid potential confounding factors, such as the gradual buildup of strong behavioral changes and the accompanying diminution of the error. The study found statistically clear changes in the complex spike discharge rate, including changes that reflect past errors in the complex spike discharge before the upcoming saccade.
Researchers have identified a potential new approach to treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons and the accumulation of a protein called TDP-43. In a study using a yeast model of ALS, scientists found that overexpressing the Sis1 chaperone protein reduced the toxic effects of TDP-43 on cells. The Sis1 chaperone is a type of protein that helps other proteins fold correctly, and its overexpression was found to alter the shape of cells and reduce the breakdown of a reporter protein by the ubiquitin proteasome system.

The researchers also found that overexpressing the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, reduced TDP-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons. This suggests that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. The study's findings are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the TDP-43-associated toxicity is caused by proteolytic dysfunction.

The researchers used a yeast model of ALS to study the effects of TDP-43 overexpression and the role of the Sis1 chaperone. They found that TDP-43 aggregates inhibit the clearance of a misfolded reporter protein by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The study's findings have implications for the development of new treatments for ALS and related conditions characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of DNA/RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43. Further research is needed to determine if the protection afforded by Sis1 and its homologues can be an effective means of extending neuronal survival in ALS.
Researchers in Brazil conducted a study to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, in 65 patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of the country. The study used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to analyze blood samples from patients, who were divided into two groups: those with the clinical indeterminate form and those with the cardiac form of the disease. The results showed that 53.8% of the patients tested positive for T. cruzi by qPCR, with a median parasite load of 2.54 parasite equivalents/mL. The parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old, with a median of 20.05 parasite equivalents/mL.

The researchers were also able to genotype the parasite in 80% of the patients with positive qPCR results, identifying the T. cruzi discrete typing unit (DTU) in 28 patients. The most common DTUs found were TcVI (40%), TcII (17.1%), and mixed infection TcVI+TcII (14.3%). Two patients were infected with TcV, and one patient was coinfected with TcIII+TcVI. The parasite load was higher in patients infected with TcII compared to those infected with TcVI. The study's findings contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the importance of age and infection with TcII in determining higher parasitemia levels.
A study conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011 aimed to investigate the prevalence of rabies virus (RABV) in bats. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for RABV, resulting in a low overall prevalence of 0.3%. However, two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were found to be infected with RABV, with viral antigens detected and infectious virus isolated from their brains, as well as from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes revealed that the two viruses were 100% identical, with one non-synonymous substitution in the glycoprotein gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two vampire bat RABV isolates were related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody, indicating exposure to the virus. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. This study provides the first report and isolation of RABV from bats in Guatemala, highlighting the need for novel strategies to prevent and control bat-associated zoonoses in tropical regions.
Researchers investigated the role of A-type lamins in herpesviral DNA targeting and heterochromatin modulation. They found that A-type lamins play a crucial role in the downregulation of heterochromatin and the activation of gene expression. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA initiates replication in replication compartments near the inner edge of the nucleus, where histones are excluded. In cells lacking A-type lamins, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in cells lacking A-type lamins. This suggests that A-type lamins are necessary for the targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The study provides evidence that the nuclear lamina serves as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications. The results indicate that A-type lamins are required for viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Hydrogenosomes are metabolically specialized anaerobic organelles that are thought to have originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts. The TOM complex plays a crucial role in the import of proteins into mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.

The study found that the TOM complex in T. vaginalis, called TvTOM, forms a translocation channel to conduct protein import into hydrogenosomes. TvTOM is composed of four subunits, including two tail-anchored proteins, Tom36 and Tom46, which can bind hydrogenosomal preproteins and function as receptors. The complex also contains a Tom22-like protein and a protein called Homp19, which has no known homology.

Electron microscopy revealed that TvTOM forms three pores and has an unconventional "skull-like" shape. The study suggests that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages. The findings provide new insights into the diversity of TOM complexes in eukaryotes and shed light on the evolution of protein import pathways in mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.
Researchers have investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in autoimmune diseases, which occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. They analyzed genetic variations in these cells to understand how they contribute to disease. The study found that specific genetic variations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are associated with several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. One of these variations, a missense variant in the IL27 gene, was found to decrease the activity of the protein and reduce the expression of downstream genes IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. This suggests that IL27 may play a role in promoting autoimmunity towards pancreatic islets. In contrast, a different variant of the IL27 gene, rs181206[G], was found to confer protection against type 1 diabetes by inhibiting the expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. The study also identified a regulatory locus at chromosome 12q13.2 containing the RPS26 gene, which may affect the stability or translational efficiency of many cytosolic mRNAs. These findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes, and highlight the importance of considering the biological context of genetic variations in understanding autoimmune diseases. Overall, the study suggests that eQTL mapping in purified T cells can provide novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to understand community perspectives on the treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The study involved interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national HAT control program in the provinces of Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental, where HAT prevalence is high.

The study found that community members and healthcare providers adhere to strict prohibitions after HAT treatment, including avoiding work, sexual intercourse, hot food, and walking in the sun for six months. These prohibitions are believed to prevent serious complications, but they are not evidence-based and were originally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the outdated melarsoprol treatment regimen. However, with the introduction of safer and more effective treatments, such as NECT, these restrictions are no longer necessary.

The study suggests that these prohibitions contribute to suboptimal uptake of HAT screening campaigns and treatment adherence, as people fear having to observe these taboos if diagnosed with HAT. The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding the origins and rationale behind these prohibitions to improve HAT control strategies in the DRC. They recommend that healthcare providers engage in a dialogue with the community to address these concerns and provide accurate information about HAT treatment. The study highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to HAT control, taking into account the social and cultural context of the affected communities.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive survey in 45 villages in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies. The survey, conducted between May and June 2011, involved door-to-door interviews with 17,702 households, representing a population of 94,369 inhabitants. The study found that VL was a possible or probable cause of 19% of all deaths in the area, with a VL-specific mortality rate of 0.9/1000 per year. The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7.0/1000 persons per year, or 7.9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. The survey also found that 12.5% of the population reported a past VL treatment episode.

The study highlights the significant health burden of VL in eastern Gedaref State, despite adequate access to care. The researchers noted that active VL case detection had a low yield in this setting, suggesting that this approach may not be the most effective strategy for controlling the disease in similar contexts. The study also found that post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a skin rash that can appear after VL treatment, is a common complication in Sudan, affecting up to 50% of treated cases.
Research on the bacterial chromosome of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica has shown that the supercoil density (σ) of DNA is influenced by the activity of gyrase, an enzyme that catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA. The supercoil density is composed of two forms: diffusible supercoil density (σD), which moves freely around the chromosome, and constrained supercoil density (σC), which results from the binding of proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA. The study found that E. coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica.

To investigate the mechanisms that control diffusible supercoil density, researchers analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb "supercoil sensor" inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor monitored both supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in wild-type and mutant strains. The results showed that RNA transcription causes negative supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) relaxed excess upstream supercoiling, while gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state.

Mutations in the gyrase gene (gyrB) caused significant supercoil losses, ranging from 30% of wild-type levels to a total loss of σD at most chromosome locations. These losses were influenced by transcription, as the addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. The study also found a link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover, suggesting that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow-growing species.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism by which the host cell controls the growth of Leishmania amazonensis, a parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World. The parasite replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) that share characteristics with late endosomes and lysosomes. The study found that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate the expression of the LYST/Beige gene, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYST/Beige led to increased PV expansion and enhanced parasite replication, while overexpression of LYST/Beige resulted in small PVs that did not support parasite growth. Treatment with vacuolin-1, which expands PVs, reversed the effect of LYST/Beige overexpression, while treatment with E-64d, which reduces PV size, inhibited parasite growth. The study suggests that enlarged PVs protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on parasite viability within large PVs but enhanced growth within small PVs. The findings indicate that the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells is a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival. This discovery may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies against L. amazonensis infections by targeting PV expansion.
Researchers created a zebrafish model to study Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, and muscle weakness. AHDS is caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which plays a crucial role in transporting thyroid hormone (TH) into the brain. Previous studies using mice with the MCT8 gene knocked out (MCT8-KO mice) did not exhibit the neurological symptoms of AHDS, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms of the disorder.

To overcome this limitation, researchers used a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated gene editing system to create a zebrafish model with the MCT8 gene knocked out (mct8−/−). The mct8−/− zebrafish exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. High-throughput behavioral assays revealed that these deficiencies were associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation.

Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live mct8−/− larvae showed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. The researchers also tested the therapeutic potential of three TH analogs that can enter the cells in the absence of MCT8 and found that they restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae. These findings suggest that MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly and mediates sensory and motor control of behavioral performance, and that TH analogs may be a potential treatment for AHDS.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that affects newborns and people with weakened immune systems. To infect cells, HCMV uses different forms of the gH/gL glycoprotein and the fusion protein gB. Research has shown that the minimal machinery required for cell-cell fusion involves only gB and gH/gL. A study has now demonstrated that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early in the virus's life cycle, even in the absence of other viral proteins. This complex includes up to 16-50% of the total gH/gL in virus particles. The study found that gH/gL can interact with gB mutants that are unable to mediate cell-cell fusion, suggesting that the interaction between gB and gH/gL is not dependent on the fusion activity of gB. This discovery has significant implications for models of herpesvirus entry, which suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to trigger membrane fusion. The study provides direct evidence for this interaction, showing that HCMV gB and gH/gL form stable complexes that are incorporated into virus particles before receptor binding or membrane fusion. This finding supports the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB and has implications for our understanding of how herpesviruses, including HCMV, enter host cells.
Researchers have identified a gene called Gimap3 that plays a crucial role in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in leukocytes, a type of blood cell. Mitochondrial DNA sequence variants can cause disease, and understanding how they segregate is essential for understanding disease onset and severity. The study used a mouse model to demonstrate that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. Gimap3 is also important for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in regulating mtDNA sequence variants and modulating human mitochondrial diseases.

The study found that Gimap3 is the first nuclear-encoded gene to influence mtDNA segregation in mammals. It regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues, which are responsible for producing blood cells. The researchers also discovered that mtDNA segregation in these tissues is a complex genetic trait that changes with age, but is independent of mtDNA copy number. The study suggests that Gimap3 regulates mtDNA segregation through a cell-specific context or pathway, rather than directly interacting with mtDNA. The findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and may have implications for understanding and treating human mitochondrial diseases. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Gimap3 in regulating mtDNA segregation in leukocytes and its potential role in modulating human mitochondrial diseases.
Researchers in Victoria, Australia, studied the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin and soft-tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The incubation period is the time between exposure to the bacteria and the onset of symptoms. The study found that the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria is approximately 4.5 to 4.8 months, with a range of 2 to 9 months. This estimate is consistent with a previous study of patients who acquired the infection in a different geographic location.

The researchers analyzed data from 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016. They identified 20 new cases among short-term visitors to endemic regions, and found that the incubation period for these cases was similar to the previous estimate. The study also found no association between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic region, or location of the BU lesion.

The study's findings suggest that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria. This knowledge can guide clinicians in diagnosing and treating the disease. Buruli ulcer is a geographically-restricted infection that is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but cases have also been reported in other parts of the world, including Australia, where it is known as "Bairnsdale ulcer" or "Daintree ulcer." The primary risk factor for BU is residence or travel within an endemic area, but the precise mode of transmission remains incompletely understood.
Researchers have identified a protein in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that plays a crucial role in lipid regulation. The protein, named TgNCR1, is similar to the human protein NPC1, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis and transport. TgNCR1 contains a sterol-sensing domain, a conserved region found in many proteins involved in lipid regulation. The researchers found that TgNCR1 localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Toxoplasma, rather than endo-lysosomes like its human counterpart. When expressed in mammalian cells, TgNCR1 restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes, indicating that it has a conserved activity with human NPC1.

To investigate the role of TgNCR1 in Toxoplasma, the researchers created a mutant strain lacking the gene for TgNCR1. The mutant parasites had normal cholesterol levels but accumulated excess cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. They also had abundant storage lipid bodies and long membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles. The mutant parasites were more virulent in mice and could generate multiple daughters per single mother cell at high frequencies, allowing for fast replication in vitro.

These findings suggest that TgNCR1 plays a role in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma, controlling the intracellular levels of several lipids. The loss of TgNCR1 function leads to an accumulation of lipids, stimulating lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division. The researchers conclude that TgNCR1 is essential for maintaining lipid balance in Toxoplasma.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly. Recent studies have identified homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene as the major cause of OAS in eight unrelated families. The SMOC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) antagonist during mammalian development. Loss of BMP antagonism is thought to contribute to the limb and eye phenotypes observed in humans and mice with OAS. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of the orthologous mouse gene, Smoc1, resulted in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations, including coloboma and cleft palate, in homozygous mutant animals. These findings suggest that partial loss of SMOC-1 function is sufficient to cause a convincing phenocopy of the human disease. Expression analysis of Smoc1 in mouse and zebrafish embryos revealed site- and stage-specific expression in developing limb buds, craniofacial structures, and pharyngeal arches, further supporting the role of SMOC-1 in ocular and limb development. Overall, these studies provide strong evidence that loss of SMOC-1 function is the major cause of OAS and highlight the conserved non-redundant function of this protein during mammalian development.
Researchers have identified a protein called TRIM22 as a key player in the body's natural defense against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Type 1 interferons, which are proteins produced by the immune system in response to viral infections, induce the production of TRIM22. Studies have shown that overexpressing TRIM22 in cells can inhibit HIV replication, but it was unclear whether this effect occurred at physiological levels of TRIM22 expression. To address this question, researchers used a technique called RNA interference to deplete TRIM22 in cells treated with interferons. They found that this depletion allowed for increased production of HIV particles, indicating that TRIM22 plays a role in restricting HIV replication. Further experiments showed that TRIM22 specifically targets the HIV Gag protein, which is essential for the assembly and release of the virus. TRIM22 blocked the release of HIV Gag-only particles, but did not affect the release of particles from other viruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV) or equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The researchers also found that the RING domain of TRIM22 is necessary for its antiviral activity. Overall, these findings suggest that TRIM22 is a natural antiviral effector that is induced by interferons and plays a critical role in restricting HIV replication.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that contributes to the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism, a symbiotic relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their host-specific pollinator wasps (Agaonidae). In this mutualism, the wasps pollinate the trees and the trees provide resources for the wasp offspring. However, a long-standing question has been why the wasps tend to oviposit (lay eggs) in the inner ovules of the fig, rather than in the outer ovules, which are more abundant.

The study found that in the fig species Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in the outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the fig. The risk of parasitism decreases towards the center of the fig, where the inner ovules provide a safe space for pollinator offspring. This gradient in offspring viability likely contributes to selection pressure on the pollinators to avoid the outer ovules, reducing their galling rates.

The researchers suggest that this previously unidentified mechanism may contribute to the persistence of the mutualism, independent of other factors such as plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators. The study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of the fig-pollinator mutualism and highlights the potential role of parasitic wasps in maintaining the stability of this symbiotic relationship. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of mutualisms in general.
Researchers studied how plant height in the model C4 grass Setaria is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. They conducted six controlled growth trials on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to assess the impact of developmental queues, water availability, and planting density on plant height. The study found that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting, and is affected by the growth environment. The results suggest that plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait influenced by multiple genetic loci that function independently of the growth environment.

The researchers identified 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with plant height throughout development in the Setaria RIL population across 12 experiments varying water availability and planting density. Analysis of ortholog positions revealed that known height-affecting genes from the Poaceae family account for only a fraction of the identified loci. The study found that alleles inherited from the weedy S. viridis parent act to increase plant height early, while a larger number of small effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S. italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development.

The results support a model where plant height is specified as a functionally continuous developmental process under strong genetic control, but can be influenced by both water availability and planting density. This chronological genetic model of plant height may explain the differences in plant height observed when parental lines are grown in controlled environments versus field settings.
Researchers have confirmed the presence of Ilheus virus (ILHV) in the Pantanal region of West-Central Brazil. The Pantanal is a large wetland area that is home to a diverse range of wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, which can facilitate the spread of zoonotic arboviruses. Previous studies had detected neutralizing antibodies to various flaviviruses, including ILHV, in horses from the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal, but the circulation of these viruses had not been confirmed through virus isolation.

To investigate further, researchers collected and tested 3,234 adult mosquitoes from 16 species in the same sub-region between 2009 and 2010. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis mosquitoes tested positive for ILHV through culture and real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full-length genomic sequence of the isolated virus showed 95% identity to the only available full genome sequence for ILHV.

The findings confirm the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal and suggest that Aedes scapularis is a potential vector for the virus. The anthropophilic behavior and high prevalence of Aedes scapularis in the region, combined with its susceptibility to ILHV infection, implicate this mosquito species as a key player in the transmission of the virus. The study highlights the need for further investigation of ILHV by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians, particularly given the potential medical importance of the virus.
Researchers conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a single-dose oral treatment of moxidectin (MOX) compared to two doses of ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. The study aimed to address the growing public health burden of scabies, a neglected infectious disease with limited treatment options and emerging drug resistance. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of MOX (0.3 mg/kg), two doses of IVM (0.2 mg/kg each), or no treatment. The treatment efficacies were evaluated by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions.

The results showed that all four MOX-treated pigs were mite-free at day 14 post-treatment, with 100% efficacy that remained unchanged until the end of the study. In contrast, only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free, with an efficacy of 62% (range 26-100%). MOX persisted in plasma and skin for approximately 9 times longer than IVM, covering the mite's entire life cycle and enabling long-lasting efficacy. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. These findings suggest that oral single-dose MOX is more effective than two consecutive IVM doses, supporting MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans.
Researchers studied the peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and prevalence in hospitals. The PG synthesis machine is responsible for producing the main component of the bacterial cell wall and is a target for many antibiotics. By deleting seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome, the researchers created a strain that could synthesize PG using only two enzymes, PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. This minimal PG synthesis machine allowed the bacteria to grow and divide normally in the lab, but made them highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics and host lytic enzymes. The bacteria also showed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model, which relies on specific peptidoglycan receptor proteins. This suggests that the additional PG synthesis enzymes play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus in clinically relevant environments. The study identifies the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus and highlights the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments outside of the lab. The findings have implications for the development of new antibiotics that target the final stages of PG synthesis.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the disease melioidosis, to understand how it acquires iron, a critical nutrient for bacterial growth. They found that the bacterium's major high-affinity siderophore, malleobactin, is not essential for its virulence in a mouse model of melioidosis. In fact, deleting the genes responsible for malleobactin production did not affect the bacterium's ability to infect and cause disease in mice. The researchers also found that the bacterium's ability to use hemin, a form of iron found in hemoglobin, is also not essential for its virulence. However, they did discover that the bacterium can use ferritin, a protein that stores iron, as an alternative source of iron. This suggests that Burkholderia pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway to sustain its growth in the host. Furthermore, the researchers found that the bacterium's ability to use lactoferrin, a protein that stores iron, is dependent on the production of malleobactin, but not pyochelin, another siderophore produced by the bacterium. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the iron-acquisition strategies of Burkholderia pseudomallei and suggest that the bacterium's ability to adapt to different iron sources may contribute to its virulence.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMMGEN to create accurate and comprehensive models of cellular metabolism. These models, known as genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs), are crucial for understanding how cells function. However, creating these models can be challenging due to inconsistencies between different models. COMMGEN automatically identifies and resolves these inconsistencies, producing a consensus model that is more accurate and comprehensive than individual GSMs.

The tool works by comparing two or more GSMs of the same organism and reconciling their differences. It identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of the metabolic networks, and uses novel algorithms to resolve common problems that arise during integration. COMMGEN has been tested on four organisms, and the results show that the automatically generated consensus models are predictive and more coherent than individual GSMs.

The use of COMMGEN can be particularly useful in complex scenarios where manual curation is not feasible, such as for eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions. The tool has been shown to increase the predictive power of GSMs while maintaining their coherence with the actual biological system. This balance is essential for the usability and reliability of GSMs in elucidating cell function and interactions. Overall, COMMGEN provides a necessary bridge between full automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus metabolic model generation.
Researchers have identified two genes, fam20b and xylt1, that play a crucial role in the development of cartilage and bone in zebrafish. These genes are responsible for producing proteoglycans (PGs), a key component of cartilage matrix. Mutations in these genes lead to a decrease in cartilage matrix and an increase in bone formation in the perichondrium, the layer of tissue surrounding cartilage. This suggests that cartilage matrix regulates the timing of bone development by inhibiting the maturation of chondrocytes, the cells that produce cartilage.

Ultrastructural analyses revealed that chondrocytes in mutants with fam20b and xylt1 mutations displayed early signs of hypertrophic differentiation, a characteristic of mature chondrocytes. This premature maturation was associated with increased expression of genes involved in bone formation, such as runx2b and collagen type 10a1. The researchers also found that the absence of cartilage matrix led to the premature expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a signaling molecule that induces bone formation in the perichondrium.

Rescue experiments and gene expression studies confirmed that the mutations in fam20b and xylt1 directly affected chondrocyte maturation, leading to early perichondral bone formation. The findings suggest that cartilage matrix plays a critical role in regulating the timing of bone development, and that mutations in fam20b and xylt1 can disrupt this process, leading to premature bone formation.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top2) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster females. They used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Top2 expression in the later stages of meiosis and observed specific defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I. Instead, they were stretched into long, abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips of the projections. Despite these anomalies, bipolar spindles were observed in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, although the obligately achiasmate 4th chromosomes exhibited a near complete failure to move toward the spindle poles during prometaphase I. Both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation. Embryos from Top2 RNAi-expressing females frequently failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The results suggest that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved for meiosis to be completed. The study supports the idea that Top2 plays a crucial role in releasing the bonds that hold heterochromatic regions together during prophase.
Researchers conducted a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study involved two areas: an intervention area where seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs in the intervention area received new collars every 7-8 months, and newly identified seronegative dogs were included and collared. In both areas, dogs that tested seropositive were marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The study found that the seroprevalence of CVL in the intervention area decreased significantly over time, from 6.0% at the final evaluation, compared to an increase of 11.0% in the control area. This suggests that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars may provide protection against CVL. However, the study's evaluation of the effectiveness of this measure as a community-wide public health control measure was inconclusive. The study's findings indicate that this strategy may be an operational challenge for local zoonosis control authorities in endemic areas of Brazil, requiring adjustments, such as improved collar design. The study's results are consistent with previous studies that have shown the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in reducing the rate of seroconversion in canine populations in other endemic areas.
Researchers have investigated the unique characteristics of the mammalian X chromosome, particularly its non-random gene content. They propose that the X chromosome's haploid expression, where one copy of the chromosome is present in males, limits the maximal expression level of genes on the X chromosome. This limitation, known as a "transcriptional traffic jam," prevents genes with very high maximal expression levels from being tolerated on the X chromosome.

Studies using the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project found that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is significantly lower than that of genes on autosomes. On average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Additionally, autosome-to-X retroposition events result in lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X chromosome compared to X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes.

The researchers also found that X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression compared to autosomal genes, particularly for highly expressed genes. This suggests that the maximal expression level, rather than the breadth of expression, is the driving force behind the biased gene content on the X chromosome. Furthermore, the study found that highly expressed tissue-specific genes are rare on the X chromosome, and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed. These findings support the "weak X" model, which proposes that the upper limit for the highest attainable level of gene expression for X-linked genes is lower than for autosomal genes.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori among the Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Western Pygmies in Cameroon. The researchers found that the Baka Pygmies had a significantly lower H. pylori infection rate (20.8%) compared to their non-Baka, agriculturalist neighbors (80.2%). The study analyzed gastric biopsies from 77 Baka Pygmies and 101 non-Baka individuals and used DNA sequencing to generate multilocus haplotypes for each H. pylori isolate. The results showed that most isolates were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations, which are associated with the expansion of the Nilo-Saharan language family and the Bantu languages, respectively. An age-structured transmission model suggested that the low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies could be achieved within a few hundred years due to demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy. The study also used coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference to show that the Baka Pygmies likely acquired their current H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors. The findings suggest that the Baka Pygmies were either H. pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations. The study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of H. pylori and its relationship with human populations.
Researchers have identified a specific region of the dengue virus protein NS5 that regulates its subcellular localization. The C-terminal 18 amino acid region (Cter18) of NS5 is responsible for directing the protein to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the dengue virus serotype. In dengue virus 2 (DENV2), NS5 localizes to the nucleus, whereas in DENV1, it remains in the cytoplasm. The Cter18 region interacts with the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha, allowing the protein to enter the nucleus. A conserved arginine residue at position 888 in the Cter18 region is essential for infectious virus production. Mutating this residue to alanine resulted in a completely non-viable virus, while a mutation to lysine led to a severely attenuated phenotype. The Cter18 region is also involved in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcellular localization. The findings suggest that the Cter18 region is a key determinant of NS5 subcellular localization and may play a role in the modulation of innate immune responses and other host factor interactions that contribute to dengue pathogenesis. A mutation in the Cter18 region, such as proline 884 to threonine, resulted in NS5 being mostly localized to the cytoplasm, demonstrating that a single amino acid change can alter the phenotype of the virus.
Researchers have developed a new, integrated mapping protocol to help control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in endemic countries. The protocol, called the Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) Methodology, combines data collection for four major NTDs: lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. This approach aims to determine whether a threshold has been reached to trigger public health interventions in a specific area.

The ITM protocol is designed to be resource-efficient and relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. The study tested the protocol in one district each in Mali and Senegal, comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each disease. The results showed that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies for trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths, but provided more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis.

The ITM protocol was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool has the potential to facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries. The study highlights the importance of an integrated approach to NTD mapping, which can provide district-level data in a timely manner and help inform public health decisions. The ITM methodology can be used as an operational tool by Ministries of Health in NTD-endemic countries to determine if the threshold needed to launch disease-specific public health interventions has been reached.
Researchers have investigated the process of mitotic exit in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on the release of the phosphatase Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin. Cdc14 is essential for the exit from mitosis, and its release from nucleolar chromatin is a critical step in this process. Two redundant pathways, the FEAR network and the MEN, promote Cdc14 release, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The study found that the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for Cdc14 release from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79, but not by the histone deacetylase Sir2, which associates with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin. Additionally, the study found that histone H3 lysine 36 methylation and an associated histone deacetylase are also required for Cdc14 release. These histone modifications are necessary for the accessibility and action of FEAR network components on nucleolar chromatin. The findings suggest that these modifications play a non-redundant role in controlling Cdc14 release, challenging the idea of a highly combinatorial code of histone marks controlling biological processes. The study provides new insights into the regulation of mitotic exit and highlights the importance of histone modifications in this process, which is conserved from yeast to mammals.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, GeneProgram, to identify and characterize expression programs in human gene expression data. An expression program is a set of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes. GeneProgram addresses challenges in identifying these programs, including cellular inhomogeneity, genetic and environmental variation, and uncertainty in the number of programs and sample populations. The framework uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to simultaneously organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior. GeneProgram produces maps of expression programs, which are sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. The researchers applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets, exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, many of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors. The discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection may guide future biological experiments, and genes from programs with low generality scores may serve as new drug targets. The method is multipurpose and can be applied to novel compendia of biological data.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) locus in NKG2Chi natural killer (NK) cells, a subset of NK cells that plays a crucial role in the defense against HCMV. In individuals infected with HCMV, NKG2Chi NK cells undergo epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1), a region that enhances IFN-γ transcriptional activity. This epigenetic imprinting is similar to that observed in memory CD8+ T cells and type 1 T helper (TH1) cells, which also express IFN-γ stably. The open configuration of the CNS1 region in NKG2Chi NK cells allows for enhanced IFN-γ production in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production. This epigenetic imprinting is a hallmark of HCMV-specific NK cell expansions and cytokine-primed NK cells, which display memory-like properties. The study suggests that epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG locus is a crucial mechanism driving strong and stable IFN-γ expression in HCMV-specific NK cell expansions, providing a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells. The findings also imply that common epigenomic features may be functional hallmarks of memory-like NK cells and memory T cells, and that HCMV infection plays a significant role in shaping the human NK cell repertoire.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its infection of host cells. The bacterium uses a protein called LubX, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to target and degrade another bacterial protein called SidH within the host cell. This process is known as ubiquitination, where a protein is tagged with a molecule called ubiquitin, marking it for degradation by the host cell's proteasome. The degradation of SidH occurs at a specific stage of infection, demonstrating a sophisticated level of coevolution between the bacterium and the host cell. This is the first example of a "metaeffector," a protein that regulates the function of another effector protein within the host cell. The researchers found that LubX specifically targets SidH for degradation, and that the determinants of this susceptibility are encoded in the effector protein itself. This suggests that other bacterial effectors may also have regulatory functions as metaeffectors, coordinating the expression of effector functions spatiotemporally. The study also raises the possibility that LubX may have multiple targets within the host cell, including a host kinase called Clk1. This discovery provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacterial pathogens and their host cells, and highlights the importance of temporal regulation in the infection process.
Researchers studied the early stages of HIV-1 infection in 81 individuals to understand how the virus evolves and adapts to its new host. They analyzed the genetic sequences of the env gene, which codes for a protein on the surface of the virus that interacts with the host's immune system. The study found that a subset of sites in the env gene diversified more rapidly than expected, suggesting that the virus is adapting to the host's immune response. 

Fourteen of these rapidly diversifying sites were found in areas of the env gene that are targeted by the host's cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are a type of immune cell that recognizes and kills infected cells. This suggests that the virus is evolving to evade the host's immune response. Additionally, some of these rapidly diversifying sites were found in areas where the enzyme APOBEC, which introduces mutations into the viral genome, is active. This suggests that APOBEC may play a role in the early stages of HIV-1 infection by introducing mutations that help the virus evade the host's immune response.

The study also found that insertions and deletions in the env gene are not random, but are instead influenced by selection pressures. The researchers found that the length variation in the hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a result of selection, rather than random mutations. Overall, the study provides new insights into the early stages of HIV-1 infection and the mechanisms by which the virus adapts to its new host.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the process of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast. The model incorporates two key chromatin marks, H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores how the presence of multiple marks affects the stability of epigenetic states. The study found that having both modifications is crucial for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. In addition to the silenced and transcriptionally active states, the model predicts the emergence of a novel bivalent state, characterized by the coexistence of both active and silencing marks. This bivalent state appears under certain perturbations, such as knock-out mutations, inhibition, or enhancement of enzymatic activity, and results in patchy silencing. The model also shows that the titration effect, caused by a limited supply of silencing proteins, can lead to counter-intuitive responses. The study systematically investigates the design principles of the silencing system and reconciles disparate experimental observations within a single theoretical framework. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, providing insights into which marks are essential for resolving epigenetic fate and which reinforce one fate over another. The findings have implications for understanding the complex mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in yeast and potentially other organisms.
Researchers in Uganda studied the gut microbiota (GM) of children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). SAM is a major health problem in many developing countries, manifesting in two forms: oedematous and non-oedematous. The study aimed to determine if GM composition differed between the two forms of malnutrition. Fecal samples were collected from 87 children aged 6-24 months, with 62% suffering from oedematous malnutrition. The results showed that GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-oedematous children having lower GM diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal larger differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The study suggests that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between gut microbiota and malnutrition, particularly in the context of oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The findings may justify further research into therapeutic strategies, such as pre- and probiotics, to address SAM in developing countries.
Researchers studied the variation in telomere length among 112 wild-type yeast isolates, specifically focusing on Saccharomyces paradoxus. They found significant variation in telomere length among these isolates, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (less than 150 base pairs) and American isolates having telomeres approximately three times as long (over 400 base pairs). By inserting a URA3 gene near telomeres, the researchers were able to accurately analyze individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). They found that crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a range of telomere lengths, suggesting that multiple genetic loci contribute to telomere length maintenance. The researchers identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including the YKU80 and TLC1 genes, which were validated as telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Furthermore, they discovered that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis in one of the allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres. The study demonstrates that telomere length is a complex trait controlled by multiple genetic loci and highlights the importance of understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying telomere length variation in yeast.
Researchers have long sought to understand the cognitive and neural processes that underlie human decision-making. One approach, sequential sampling models (SSMs), assumes that decisions emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, a limitation of SSMs is that they do not account for situations where individuals choose to delay their decision and terminate the accumulation process temporarily. In a study using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants made choices about fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. Standard SSM implementations failed to accurately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model improved the fit to the data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies, indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited. This supports the existence of a decision not to decide. The extended model also accounted for results from an adapted version of the paradigm where participants had to press a button to sample more information. These findings suggest that computational modeling of decisions and RTs can provide a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in Labrador Retrievers with hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK), a skin disorder that causes crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. The mutation is a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, which encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation, specifically in the silencing of chromatin. The mutation changes an asparagine to a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme, disrupting its function.

The study used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the mutation, which was then confirmed in a larger cohort of dogs. Histopathological analysis revealed that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather by delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. This suggests that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of the epidermis.

The researchers speculate that the tissue-specific expression profiles of the partially redundant H3K9 methyltransferases may explain why a defect in a broadly expressed enzyme leads to a very tissue-specific clinical phenotype. The study provides new insights into the epigenetics of keratinocyte differentiation and highlights the importance of SUV39H2 in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying HNPK and the role of SUV39H2 in epigenetic regulation.
Researchers studied how two types of influenza A viruses (IAVs), one from birds and one from pigs, interact when they infect pigs together. They found that when pigs are co-infected with both viruses, the viruses can swap genetic material and create new combinations, known as reassortants. These reassortants can potentially spread to other animals, including humans. The study analyzed 571 samples from pigs infected with both viruses and identified 30 different types of reassortants. The researchers found that the reassortants that emerged in the lower respiratory tract of the pigs had the most genetic diversity and were more likely to be transmitted to other pigs. The study suggests that the type of tissue in the pig's body, or tissue tropism, plays a key role in determining which reassortants are shed and can be transmitted to other animals. The researchers also found that the cold temperature in the pig's nasal cells helped select which reassortants were shed. One reassortant was consistently found in the upper, middle, and lower respiratory tracts of the pigs and was shown to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. The study's findings highlight the potential for pigs to serve as a "mixing vessel" for generating and transmitting reassortant viruses that could pose a risk to humans.
Researchers investigated the impact of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistosoma mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. The study, conducted in Uganda, involved 1343 children whose mothers were either treated with praziquantel or a placebo during pregnancy. The results showed that 2.4% of the children had Schistosoma mansoni infection at age five years, with no significant difference in infection prevalence between children of treated and untreated mothers. The study also found that infected children had higher cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma antigens compared to uninfected children. However, praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no significant effect on immune responses, except for interleukin-10 (IL-10) responses to Schistosoma worm antigen (SWA), which were higher in offspring of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy. The findings suggest that maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy do not significantly influence the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection or effector immune response among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal Schistosoma mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
Macrophages, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in eliminating infectious pathogens from the body. When activated by inflammatory stimuli, macrophages undergo a change in their endocytic machinery, shifting from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis. This reprogramming allows macrophages to rapidly internalize and transfer large amounts of cargo to lysosomes for degradation. The key molecular switch that triggers this change is the serine phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake.

Studies have shown that the expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis, even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This suggests that coronin 1 phosphorylation is a crucial step in regulating the internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. In fact, the expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of coronin 1 resulted in the rapid elimination of mycobacteria, regardless of the macrophage activation state.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in macropinocytic entry and highlight the importance of coronin 1 phosphorylation in regulating this process. The ability of macrophages to switch from phagocytosis to macropinocytosis upon activation is an efficient strategy for the immune system to clear large amounts of extracellular material and eliminate pathogens.
Researchers conducted a study in Arua District, North West Uganda, to assess community acceptance of tsetse control baits, which are used to combat sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis or HAT). The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across the district. The results showed that villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear, anxiety, and panic when they first encountered them, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river." In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The study suggests that acceptance of traps varies markedly between villages and is related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The findings highlight the importance of early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns to reach all communities, especially those new to tsetse control interventions. This is crucial for the success of community-based interventions against tsetse. The study's results are consistent with previous research, which has shown that community acceptance of traps is a vital element for effective tsetse control. The study's findings have implications for the deployment of tsetse control baits in areas where they have not been used before.
Scientists have long understood the importance of recombination, a fundamental biological process, in shaping the evolution of species. However, previous studies have been limited by a lack of detailed characterization of recombination rates across genomes and within species. A new study in Drosophila melanogaster provides the first high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, distinguishing between two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). The researchers analyzed 5,860 female meioses, genotyping 139 million informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mapping 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases. This allowed them to create whole-genome CO and GC maps, as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. The study found that CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hotspots and coldspots. In contrast, GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome. Recombination events are associated with specific sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study highlights the need to consider multiple layers of variation in recombination rates to accurately estimate recombination rates and understand the interaction between selection and linkage. The findings have significant implications for population genetic models and our understanding of the evolutionary process.
Researchers have further elucidated the function of IDN2, a protein involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through affinity purification, they identified two IDN2 paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2, which form a complex with IDN2. The study found that the coiled-coil domain of IDN2 is essential for its homodimerization, but not for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. In contrast, the XH domain of IDN2 is required for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2, as well as for the formation of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex.

The researchers demonstrated that IDP1 is necessary for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, while IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. However, unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are unable to bind double-stranded RNA. This suggests that the roles of IDP1 and IDP2 differ from those of IDN2 in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex, and that IDP1 and IDP2 are essential for the functioning of the complex in RdDM.

Mutations in the XH domain of IDN2 resulted in the failure of the mutated IDN2 transgenes to complement the DNA methylation defect of idn2 at a canonical RdDM target. This demonstrates that the XH domain of IDN2 is essential for its function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing in vivo.
Researchers investigated how neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, respond to Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and play a crucial role in fighting infections. The study found that when neutrophils are exposed to L. braziliensis, they become activated and release inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and neutrophil elastase. This activation is accompanied by an increase in the production of superoxide, a hallmark of neutrophil activation. The researchers also observed that neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis display markers of early apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

In vivo, the study showed that neutrophils are recruited to the site of L. braziliensis inoculation, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, the researchers found that neutrophils exposed to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules, such as CD18 and CD62L, and induced the oxidative burst. The study used mCherry-expressing L. braziliensis to determine that these effects were mainly observed in infected neutrophils, rather than bystander cells.

The findings suggest that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection. The study highlights the complex interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis, which may have implications for the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Researchers explored the potential benefits of using cattle vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs, and it is illegal in the European Union due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds, and countries are bTB-free. However, new diagnostic tests that can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) offer the possibility of introducing vaccination within existing eradication programs.

The study used within-herd transmission models to assess the feasibility of using BCG vaccination in combination with DIVA testing. The results showed that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the main barrier to seeing a herd-level benefit of vaccination. To achieve a protective herd-level benefit, the DIVA test would need to have a specificity of at least 99.85% and a sensitivity of more than 40%.

The researchers estimated that using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve the required specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% relative to post-mortem detection. The study also found that the potential negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated by relaxing testing, but this could potentially increase the hidden burden of infection within officially TB-free herds. The results suggest that vaccination could be a useful supplementary control measure for bTB, particularly if the DIVA test characteristics can be improved to meet the required standards.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds, dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-ones, that show promise as a treatment for trichuriasis, a parasitic infection caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. The infection affects around 500 million people worldwide, causing physical growth and educational performance issues. Current treatments are limited and often ineffective, making new options crucial for eradication efforts.

Using a model parasite, Trichuris muris, the researchers screened a library of 480 small molecules and found that dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-ones caused paralysis in adult parasites. Further testing identified 20 active compounds, which showed low cytotoxicity against mouse gut epithelial cells, indicating selectivity for the parasite. The most potent compound, OX02983, also reduced the ability of embryonated eggs to establish infection in a mouse host in vivo.

These findings suggest that dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-ones could be a new class of anthelmintics, active against both egg and adult stages of Trichuris parasites. The researchers aim to further optimize these compounds to improve their potency and pharmacokinetic properties, with the goal of developing a clinical agent for trichuriasis treatment.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks. Date hubs were initially thought to be global connectors with low co-expression with their partners, while party hubs were seen as local coordinators with high co-expression. However, the study found that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of highly central hubs, which do not display low expression correlation with their partners. This challenges the idea that date hubs are global connectors.

The study also found that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date/party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs do not generally correlate with co-expression. In contrast, the study found significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins.

The researchers suggest that thinking in terms of a date/party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful. Instead, they propose conceiving of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. The study's findings indicate that the roles of hubs in protein interaction networks are more diverse than previously thought and cannot be explained by a simple dichotomy.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks using whole genome sequence data. However, a major limitation of these approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between the sampled pathogen genomes. To address this limitation, the concept of "transmission divergence" was introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using simulated outbreak scenarios and sequence evolution models, researchers estimated transmission divergence for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. The results showed that transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This limited genetic diversity had a significant impact on the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic sequence data. The study found that rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. The study highlights the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios and emphasizes the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome are silenced in female mammals, a process called X chromosome inactivation (XCI). They analyzed gene expression and chromatin structure in mouse tissues and cells to identify genes that escape XCI. The study found that only a small percentage of genes (3-7%) escape XCI in mouse tissues, but a higher percentage (21%) escape in an in vitro system of embryonic-kidney-derived cells. The researchers used a new algorithm to calculate the probability of bi-allelic versus mono-allelic expression and identified genes expressed from both X chromosomes in female mouse tissues. They found that escape genes were distributed along the X chromosome and rarely clustered, and distance from the X inactivation center did not influence levels of expression from the inactive X chromosome. The study also identified tissue-specific escape genes, which may contribute to sex differences in certain tissues. The findings suggest that XCI and escape from XCI are tightly controlled in vivo, and that escape genes play important roles in regulating transcription and translation. The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms of XCI and the regulation of gene expression in female mammals. The identification of tissue-specific escape genes may help explain functional mechanisms leading to sex differences in certain tissues. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of XCI and the need for further research into the regulation of gene expression in female mammals.
Researchers have identified a novel cysteine protease in the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax, designated as Vivapain-4 (VX-4). This protease is one of four cysteine proteases found in P. vivax, and its biochemical properties and biological activity have been characterized. The study found that VX-4 has dual substrate specificity, depending on the surrounding micro-environmental pH. At acidic pH, it hydrolyzes certain substrates, while at neutral pH, it hydrolyzes others. The protease prefers positively charged amino acids and glutamine at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at other positions. VX-4 was localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax and showed maximal activity against actin at neutral pH, and against P. vivax plasmepsin 4 and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. The study suggests that VX-4 may function as a hemoglobinase in the acidic parasite food vacuole, a maturase of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 at neutral or acidic pH, and a cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the neutral erythrocyte cytosol. The identification and characterization of VX-4 provide new insights into the biology of P. vivax and may lead to the development of new antimalarial drugs targeting cysteine proteases.
Researchers have developed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. This model, named iJL965-ME, represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactor, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesize RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model provides new insights into the biology of C. ljungdahlii and significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology.

The ME-model accurately predicted the secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, during changing carbon and metal availability. It also revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in C. ljungdahlii. Furthermore, the model predicted and experimentally validated changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, providing new knowledge about proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.

The ME-model was used to explore the energetics of autotrophic growth in C. ljungdahlii, which was previously poorly understood. The model showed that proton exportation can be coupled to ferredoxin oxidation and NAD+ reduction by the Rnf complex, providing a new understanding of energy conservation in acetogens. The development of the iJL965-ME model provides a valuable tool for designing new strategies for the biotechnological production of commodity chemicals using C. ljungdahlii and other acetogens.
Researchers used a panel of human osteoblasts (HObs) to study the genetic control of transcript isoform variation, a phenomenon where different versions of a gene are expressed in different tissues. This approach is similar to previous studies using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The study found that HObs and LCLs have distinct gene expression profiles, with some genes being specific to each tissue type. By analyzing the genetic variants associated with transcript isoforms, the researchers identified that differential expression of isoforms in HObs is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These variants can regulate isoforms in a tissue-specific or tissue-independent manner. The study also found that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both tissues and that genetic control may affect the relative expression of one isoform to another, rather than having an all-or-none effect. The researchers examined the top SNPs from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bone mineral density and found overlap with probeset associations observed in this study. A novel transcript isoform variant of the FAM118A gene was identified through association studies in two additional clinical studies. This approach to examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is useful for detecting genetic variation common to different cell types and identifying cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant, an important follow-up step for GWAS.
Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces eubayanus, a parent of the lager-brewing hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus, to understand why it cannot utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer's wort. Unlike most Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus strains, Saccharomyces eubayanus lacks maltotriose transporter genes. However, it has four SeMALT genes that enable the uptake of maltose, a related sugar. By subjecting Saccharomyces eubayanus to laboratory evolution, researchers obtained a strain that could ferment both maltose and maltotriose. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a new gene, SeMALT413, which resulted from the combination of three SeMALT genes through a process called gene introgression. This new gene enabled the yeast to grow on maltotriose. The structure of SeMALT413 is similar to that of maltotriose transporters in Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that gene neofunctionalization, or the evolution of a new function from an existing gene, played a role in the emergence of maltotriose transporter genes in Saccharomyces yeasts. This study provides insights into the evolution of maltotriose utilization in hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus lager-brewing strains and suggests that similar mechanisms may have contributed to the development of maltotriose transporters in these strains.
Researchers have identified a correlation between the antigenic variation of influenza viruses and the excess mortality they cause. This relationship allows for the development of a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains based on their HA sequences. A simplified host-virus interaction model was proposed to explore the relationship between antigenic variations of influenza viruses and excess mortalities. The model considers strains of distinct antigenicity that cause significant infection in the human population, denoted as "antigenic strains." Using this model, a positive correlation was established between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each subtype of seasonal influenza viruses. This correlation enabled the development of a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus. The method, called EADpred, predicts antigenic distance with a relatively high accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in the rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden. The researchers believe that this method will be useful for rapid assessment of the influenza mortality burden of other future A (H1N1) variants and can be applied to the antigenic variants of human A (H3N2) and B viruses with proper modification.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein from the Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, that suppresses plant immunity. This protein, called PpEC23, is one of many small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCRPs) encoded by the fungus's genome. While SSCRPs are thought to play a role in the fungus's interaction with its host plant, their functions were previously unknown. The study found that PpEC23 interacts with a soybean transcription factor called GmSPL12l, which normally acts as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. When GmSPL12l is silenced, soybean plants exhibit constitutively active immunity, suggesting that GmSPL12l plays a key role in suppressing plant immune responses. The researchers also found that PpEC23 is able to suppress soybean immune responses and physically interact with GmSPL12l. This is the first time a virulence function has been identified for a rust fungus SSCRPs. The study suggests that PpEC23 may be a representative of a conserved protein-protein interaction platform used by rust fungi to manipulate host immune responses. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which rust fungi interact with their host plants and could lead to the development of new strategies for controlling soybean disease epidemics caused by P. pachyrhizi.
Researchers have identified the EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) as a key player in the invasion and replication of Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacterium that causes sexually transmitted infections. Chlamydia invades host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, where it recruits and modulates various host proteins to support its development. The bacterium induces a long-lasting activation of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is essential for efficient replication. The study found that EphA2, a cell surface tyrosine kinase, acts as a receptor for Chlamydia, promoting PI3K activation and chlamydial replication. Interfering with EphA2 binding to Chlamydia or downregulating EphA2 expression significantly reduced infection. Chlamydia interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, leading to its internalization and accumulation around the inclusion. During replication, EphA2 remains active and interacts with the PI3K regulatory subunit to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overexpressing EphA2 enhanced PI3K activation and Chlamydia infection, while inhibiting EphA2 activity reduced infection. The study also found that Chlamydia induces upregulation of EphA2 through the ERK pathway, keeping the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. These findings provide evidence for a host cell surface receptor exploited by Chlamydia for invasion and intracellular signaling, and highlight a new mechanism by which the bacterium subverts the host cell and induces apoptosis resistance.
Researchers have long known that neurons have active ion channels in their dendrites, which can support non-linear summation and dendritic spikes. However, the role of these active conductances in dendritic computation has remained unclear. A new study suggests that the primary function of active dendritic conductances is to enhance the dynamic range of neurons, allowing them to detect and amplify weak signals while saturating slowly for stronger inputs.

The study used a model of an active dendritic tree and found that its average output is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, achieving extremely large dynamic ranges of over 50 decibels. The model also yielded double-sigmoid response functions, similar to those observed in retinal ganglion cells. The researchers propose that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges and that blocking active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range.

The study suggests that active dendrites can amplify weak signals and saturate slowly for stronger inputs, addressing the universal "dynamic range" problem of signal processing. This is important for individual neurons, neural networks, sensory organs, and organisms. The findings also imply that the neuron transfer function may not be a simple Hill-like saturating curve, but rather a double-sigmoid behavior, as observed in some experimental studies. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function and computation.
Researchers have developed methods to infer regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data. However, these methods often rely on assumptions that may not be valid, such as equating mRNA abundance with protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects. To investigate the impact of these assumptions, the authors used a combination of models and experiments to study the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network. They measured in real-time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in this module and estimated protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression.

The results show that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. The authors propose new controls for transcriptome experiments, including the use of constitutively-expressed genes, and mathematical models to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate global physiological effects into the network inference process. They demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.

The study suggests that accounting for the distinction between cellular responses on the level of mRNA and protein influences the results of the inference process. The authors show that estimating time-varying protein concentrations from promoter activities, using kinetic models and physiologically realistic half-lives, improves the inference of regulatory interactions and gene regulation functions. This approach is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks.
Researchers studied the spatial and temporal distribution of Oligoryzomys fulvescens, a rodent species that serves as a reservoir for hantavirus, in the Agua Buena region of Panama. They analyzed data collected over four years, from 2006 to 2009, using a 90-node grid that covered an area of 6.43 square kilometers. The study found that the population density and dispersion of O. fulvescens varied across seasons and years, with the species typically being absent during the late transitional months of the season and re-establishing itself in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that local populations of O. fulvescens were approximately 300-600 meters in size, with sharply demarcated borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The study also found that O. fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, leading to a pattern of changing aggregation. This variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures, such as agricultural activities, which influenced the occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations. The results provide insights into the challenges of monitoring and predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations, which are subject to fluctuations over time and are geographically restricted, even within their range. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of reservoir populations and their relationship with the environment in predicting the risk of disease transmission.
Researchers have developed a new method to understand how genetic changes in the influenza A (H3N2) virus affect its ability to evade the human immune system. This is crucial for creating effective vaccines. The method, called antigenic tree inference, assigns weights to genetic changes in the virus's surface protein, hemagglutinin, to determine their impact on the virus's antigenic phenotype. The technique was applied to 35 years of data on the evolution of the H3N2 virus, from 1968 to 2003. The results showed that the method accurately predicted the impact of genetic changes on the virus's ability to evade the immune system, identifying both known and novel sites of antigenic impact. The method can also be used to study other viruses and systems where genetic sequences and phenotype distances are available.

The antigenic tree inference method uses a least-squares optimization procedure to fit pairwise antigenic distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the impact of individual genetic changes on the virus's antigenic phenotype. The method can be used to identify areas and branches in the tree corresponding to known antigenic types and transitions between these types. This information can be used to identify isolates and associated changes with large antigenic impact, which are important for updating vaccine strains prior to antigenic type transitions. The method is not limited to the study of influenza viruses and can be applied to other systems where homologous genetic sequences and pairwise phenotype distances are available.
A large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen was used to identify host cell factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. The study found that nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis is essential for the import of the viral DNA (vDNA) into the nucleus. In interphase cells, the virus is endocytosed and routed to the perinuclear area, but the vDNA fails to enter the nucleus. However, when the nuclear envelope is broken down during mitosis, the vDNA is able to associate with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate. This suggests that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis to access the nucleoplasm. The study also found that a cluster of mitotic genes is required for HPV16 infection, and that the virus causes a significant increase in the fraction of cells that display prolonged mitosis. This may be a mechanism for the virus to promote vDNA import into nuclei, a difficult step in the entry program. The results of this study highlight the importance of nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for HPV16 infection and provide a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies. The use of RNAi screens has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing pathogen-host interactions, and this study demonstrates its value in identifying host cell factors required for viral infection.
Black Sigatoka disease, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, is a major threat to global banana production. The disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which can lead to the rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains, causing disease-control failures worldwide. To combat this issue, the genomes of two P. fijiensis strains, CIRAD86 and CIRAD139, were sequenced and analyzed. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is highly expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, also show similar expansions.

Genetic analysis revealed chromosome-length polymorphisms and high genetic diversity in P. fijiensis field populations, indicating strong selection and limited gene flow. The frequency of fungicide resistance was higher in fungicide-treated plantations than in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, was identified in the P. fijiensis genome, which triggered a hypersensitive-like response in the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4. This suggests that Calcutta 4 may carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAvr4.

The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules and improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. Diversifying and increasing host resistance in banana may be the only way to slow the devastation caused by this fungus in the future. The availability of the P. fijiensis genome sequence and resequence data will facilitate the development of resistant cultivars in banana breeding programs.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the evolution of gene regulation in different species. This method uses a "birth-death" model to analyze changes in the binding sites of transcription factors, which are proteins that control gene expression. Unlike previous approaches, this method does not rely on comparing the DNA sequences of different species, which can be prone to errors, especially in non-coding regions of the genome.

The researchers applied this method to six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, and ETS1) and found that a significant portion of their binding sites in humans have evolved since the human-mouse common ancestor. In fact, over 15% of all binding sites are unique to humans and are often found near genes involved in specific biological pathways. These lineage-specific binding sites also tend to have more genetic variations, or SNPs, than older binding sites.

The study suggests that this new method can help identify regulatory elements that contribute to species-specific traits. By analyzing the evolution of binding sites, researchers can gain insights into how gene regulation has changed over time and how these changes have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. The findings of this study provide a new perspective on the evolution of gene regulation and highlight the importance of considering lineage-specific regulatory elements in understanding the biology of different species.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which light regulates the expression of the period2 (per2) gene in zebrafish, a vertebrate model for studying the circadian clock. The per2 gene plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of light on the circadian clock in zebrafish. A Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter was found to be necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements, which are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. TEF mRNA levels were found to be light-inducible, and knockdown of TEF expression attenuated light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. These findings support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. The LRM sequence is strongly conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks. Furthermore, the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells.
Researchers have identified a protein called coronin that plays a crucial role in the motility of Plasmodium sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite. These parasites need to migrate to penetrate tissue barriers and enter host cells. The study found that coronin regulates gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites by binding to actin filaments. Without coronin, the parasites show motility defects that impair their ability to colonize the mosquito salivary glands, but not their migration in the skin. This results in decreased transmission efficiency.

The researchers discovered that coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner. When extracellular ligands engage with the parasite, an intracellular calcium release occurs, followed by the actin-dependent relocalization of coronin to the rear of the gliding sporozoite, initiating motility. The study suggests that coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility. Additionally, protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly, and calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics.

Coronin is essential for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice, as parasites lacking coronin or expressing mutated coronin show defects in salivary gland invasion. The study highlights the importance of coronin in malaria transmission and provides new insights into the mechanisms of Plasmodium sporozoite motility.
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a key treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. However, the potential for resistance to this drug is a significant concern. Researchers have identified four novel AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines, which exhibit altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that one line had a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase, while three lines had reduced expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT), a gene responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. SMT is encoded by two tandem gene copies with different expression levels, and reduced overall expression was associated with the loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy due to structural variations at the locus. These variations were linked to local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. The loss of SMT expression was not associated with a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo in at least one case. This study highlights the potential for genomic instability at the SMT locus to contribute to AmB resistance in Leishmania parasites, which could have significant implications for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity from human observers performing a simple visual task. Participants either attended or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The results showed that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features. Attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain, particularly for mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli. This finding supports a recent version of predictive coding theory, which proposes that attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by increasing the gain of prediction errors.

The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch response profiles in response to surprising stimuli, but not unpredictable stimuli. This suggests that attention boosts mismatch prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli. The researchers used forward encoding models to quantify the selectivity for orientation and mismatch information in the neural responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli. The results demonstrate that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli, consistent with the "mismatch information model" of predictive coding theory. This study advances our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain and supports the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, is divided into three sub-species: T. b. brucei, T. b. rhodesiense, and T. b. gambiense. While T. b. brucei is unable to infect humans due to its sensitivity to trypanosome lytic factors (TLF) found in human serum, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense are resistant to lysis by TLF. T. b. gambiense is further divided into two sub-groups: group 1 and group 2, which differ genetically and in their resistance to human serum.

Previous research suggested that group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to TLF-1 due to reduced expression of the TLF-1 receptor gene, haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR). However, a new study investigated whether this is also true for group 2 T. b. gambiense. The study found that both resistant and sensitive lines of group 2 T. b. gambiense express the HpHbR gene at similar levels and internalize fluorescently labeled TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. b. brucei.

The study also found that both resistant and sensitive group 2 T. b. gambiense, as well as group 1 T. b. gambiense, internalize recombinant APOL1, but only sensitive group 2 parasites are lysed. This suggests that group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as group 1 T. b. gambiense. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype, and expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR. Therefore, there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling the latency of HIV-1, a mechanism that allows the virus to evade the immune system and antiretroviral drugs. They found that methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) acts as an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism, controlling the resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and determining the stability of the virus's latency. This study used an in vitro model of reactivable latency and a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients to demonstrate that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' LTR is a late event during the establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for the initial silencing of the virus. The researchers also found that the latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and chromatin-dependent mechanisms tends to be leaky and easily reactivable. In contrast, the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable plasma viremia contained HIV-1 promoters and enhancers that were hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation. However, even dense methylation of the HIV-1 5' LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation of latent HIV-1 with certain histone deacetylase inhibitors and protein kinase C agonists. The study suggests that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' LTR is an important epigenetic mechanism that maintains the latency of HIV-1 proviruses and may have implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism commonly used in scientific research. The catalog includes over 3.6 million distinct genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and complex variants. These variations were identified in 39 inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) using next-generation sequencing technology.

The study found that the density of genetic variations is higher near other variations, but this is due to population-level processes rather than the variations themselves being mutagenic. The researchers also mapped cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for over 2,000 genes, revealing that insertions and deletions have larger effects on gene expression than SNPs. Notably, the study found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, indicating a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between males and females.

The researchers also performed RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, validating the majority of strong cis-eQTLs in heterozygous individuals. The study provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in Drosophila and highlights the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression. Overall, this comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in Drosophila will facilitate further research into the complex relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation.
Researchers investigated how amplitude cancellation affects the relationship between the neural drive to muscles and the rectified electromyography (EMG) signal. Amplitude cancellation occurs when motor unit action potentials overlap, causing a loss of EMG amplitude. This can distort the spectrum of the rectified EMG and its correlation with the neural drive. The study used analytical derivations and a computational model to examine the impact of amplitude cancellation on this correlation. The results showed that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMGnc) is a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EMG signal. However, the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive decreased linearly with increasing amplitude cancellation. The simulations also found that a stronger neural drive resulted in a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, but amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components of the neural drive. The study concluded that amplitude cancellation impairs the ability of the rectified EMG signal to accurately reflect the neural drive to the muscle, except in conditions with low contraction levels and/or highly variable common synaptic input. The findings suggest that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which plants respond to aluminum (Al) stress, which can inhibit root growth. They found that the YUCCA (YUC) genes, which encode flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulate local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. When plants are exposed to Al, the YUC3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 genes are up-regulated in the root-apex TZ, leading to an accumulation of auxin and subsequent root growth inhibition. This process is dependent on ethylene signaling, as increasing or disrupting ethylene signaling affects the up-regulation of YUCs in response to Al stress. The researchers also found that ethylene enhances root growth inhibition under Al stress, which is alleviated in yuc mutants or by co-treatment with yucasin, an inhibitor of YUC activity. Furthermore, they discovered that ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) directly regulates YUC9 transcription, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) functions as a transcriptional activator for YUC5, 8, and 9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signal in the root-apex TZ. The study highlights a regulatory cascade for YUCs-regulated local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ mediating root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.
Researchers have found that certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in rhesus macaques. NK cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off viral infections. The SIV peptides bind to a molecule called Mamu-A1*002, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule on the surface of infected cells. This binding stabilizes the interaction between Mamu-A1*002 and another molecule called Mamu-KIR3DL05, which is an inhibitory receptor on NK cells. As a result, the NK cells are less likely to attack and kill the infected cells.

The researchers tested 75 SIV peptides and found that 28 of them suppressed the cytolytic activity of NK cells. These peptides included three immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes that are known to be presented on the surface of SIV-infected cells. The peptides with the highest affinity for Mamu-A1*002 were the most effective at suppressing NK cell activity. The researchers also found that low concentrations of inhibitory peptides can dominate and suppress NK cell responses, even in the presence of disinhibitory peptides.

The study suggests that SIV may evade NK cell responses by acquiring changes in epitopes that stabilize MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs. This mechanism may also apply to other immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1. The findings provide new insights into how viruses can evade the immune system and highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between viruses and immune cells.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, a common cause of ear infections, adapts to changing environments within the human body. They found that when this bacterium is exposed to temporary shortages of iron, a crucial nutrient, it undergoes genetic changes that enhance its ability to form communities within host cells. These communities, called intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), are thought to play a key role in the bacterium's ability to persist in the body despite the host's immune response.

The researchers created a mutant strain of the bacterium that was unable to break down a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is involved in cellular signaling. In a laboratory model of ear infection, they found that this mutant strain formed more IBCs than the original strain early in the infection process. In contrast, the original strain formed more IBCs later in the infection, when the host's immune response had begun to clear the infection.

These findings suggest that the bacterium's ability to adapt to changing environments, such as nutrient shortages, allows it to form IBCs and persist in the body. The researchers propose that this adaptation is a key factor in the bacterium's ability to cause chronic infections. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Haemophilus influenzae causes ear infections and may have implications for the development of new treatments for these infections.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, interacts with its host's iron metabolism during infection. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and immune response modulation. The study found that B. pseudomallei downregulates the expression of ferroportin, a protein responsible for iron export, in host macrophages, leading to increased iron availability within the cells. This allows the bacteria to grow and survive inside the macrophages. Experiments with iron supplementation and chelation showed that increased iron availability stimulates bacterial growth, while limiting iron availability reduces bacterial survival. In mice infected with B. pseudomallei, the bacteria caused a decrease in ferroportin expression, leading to higher iron retention in the liver and lower iron levels in the serum. Administering iron to infected mice promoted bacterial growth and inflammation, while limiting iron availability improved bacterial clearance and reduced inflammation. The study suggests that B. pseudomallei modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate its growth and survival, and that iron chelating drugs may be a potential therapeutic option for treating melioidosis. The findings also indicate that changes in host iron homeostasis can influence susceptibility to the disease.
Researchers have developed a new technique called functional mode analysis (FMA) to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their biological function. Traditional methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA), focus on large-scale and low-frequency motions, but may not necessarily reveal motions linked to specific protein functions. FMA, on the other hand, uses an arbitrary "functional quantity" to quantify the protein's functional state and detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to it. This approach can be applied to various types of functional quantities, including geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observables. Two correlation measures are used: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which assesses linear correlation, and mutual information, which evaluates any kind of interdependence. By identifying the maximally correlated motion, FMA allows researchers to derive a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. The technique has been applied to several biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein, demonstrating its potential to elucidate relationships between collective motions and protein function. FMA complements experimental methods and molecular dynamics simulations, providing a new tool for understanding protein dynamics and function.
Researchers studied the removal of introns from nuclear transcripts in Euglena gracilis, a type of eukaryotic cell. Introns are non-coding regions within genes that are removed during the process of gene expression. Euglena gracilis contains two types of introns: conventional and nonconventional. Conventional introns are found in most eukaryotic cells, while nonconventional introns are unique to euglenids and marine diplonemids. Nonconventional introns do not have the typical characteristics of conventional introns, such as conserved borders or a sequence complementary to U1 snRNA.

The study examined the order of intron removal from two genes, tubA and gapC, which contain both types of introns. The researchers used the PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system to analyze the intermediate products of splicing. The results showed that nonconventional introns are removed later than conventional introns. Additionally, the study found that transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional introns present accumulated, suggesting a time gap between the two types of splicing.

This study provides new insights into the splicing process in euglenids and marine diplonemids. The findings suggest that nonconventional introns are removed rapidly, but after conventional introns. The discovery of nonconventional introns in marine diplonemids, a common eukaryotic group in the oceans, expands our understanding of the diversity of introns in eukaryotic cells. Further research is needed to fully understand the function and evolution of nonconventional introns.
Researchers investigated the long-term effects of a mild coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection in infants on the development of the heart. They used a mouse model to study the impact of the virus on cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), which are essential for the growth and repair of the heart. The study found that a subclinical dose of CVB3 infection in juvenile mice did not cause immediate symptoms, but led to a significant reduction in the number of CPCs in the heart. This reduction persisted into adulthood, even after the virus had been cleared from the heart.

When adult mice that had been infected with CVB3 as juveniles were subjected to cardiac stress, they developed heart failure, characterized by hypertrophy and dilation of the left ventricle. In contrast, mice that had not been infected with CVB3 showed a compensatory increase in blood vessel formation in response to cardiac stress. The researchers also found that CVB3 preferentially infected CPCs in the juvenile heart, leading to their premature differentiation or death.

These findings suggest that a self-limited CVB3 infection in infancy may have long-term consequences for the heart's ability to adapt to increased load, potentially leading to heart failure later in life. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the association between early subclinical infections and late-onset heart failure.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of cell death in macrophages infected with Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes melioidosis. They found that in the early stages of infection, caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis (a form of cell death) are dependent on the NLRC4 inflammasome, but not on the NLRP3 inflammasome. In contrast, at later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death are independent of NLRC4. The researchers identified a pathway involving caspases-9, -7, and PARP downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1 in the early phase of infection. They also found that caspase-1/11-deficient macrophages undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), which is dependent on the activation of apoptotic initiator and effector caspases. The study suggests that the T3SS3 (type III secretion system 3) of B. pseudomallei plays a major role in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. The T3SS3 effector protein BopE was found to contribute to caspase-1 processing, while a mutant of the T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK was unable to activate caspase-1, leading to reduced cell death and IL-1β secretion in macrophages. In a mouse model, infection with the BsaK mutant resulted in decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads, and reduced inflammation. The study highlights the complex mechanisms of cell death in B. pseudomallei infection and the importance of the T3SS3 in the pathogenesis of melioidosis.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Arabidopsis KINβγ subunit of the SnRK1 complex in regulating pollen hydration on the stigma during pollination. The study found that KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein in the vegetative cells of pollen grains in Arabidopsis. Mutations in the KINβγ gene resulted in defective pollen germination on the stigma, despite normal germination in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised, but adding water to the stigma promoted germination. The study also found that the structure and number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in mutant pollen were significantly reduced compared to wild-type pollen. Additionally, the mutant pollen exhibited reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen, and reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing Arabidopsis CATALASE 3 resulted in compromised hydration of pollen on the stigma. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for regulating ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is essential for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. The study provides new insights into the mechanism underlying pollen-stigma interactions and highlights the importance of KINβγ in plant reproduction.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SPβ. Prophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and in this case, the toxin genes they carry can harm the host cell. RNase III achieves this protection by degrading two specific mRNAs, txpA and yonT, which are encoded by the prophages. These mRNAs are sensitive to RNase III, and when the enzyme is present, it cleaves them, preventing the production of the toxic proteins they encode. Without RNase III, these mRNAs are not degraded, and the toxins are produced, leading to cell death. The researchers found that the essential function of RNase III in B. subtilis is not related to its role in ribosomal RNA maturation or other cellular processes. Instead, its primary function is to silence the toxin genes carried by the prophages. This is a unique feature of B. subtilis, as in other bacteria, RNase III is not essential for survival. The study highlights the importance of RNase III in protecting B. subtilis from viral infection and provides new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial defense against phages.
Researchers have investigated the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a parasite that causes Lymphatic Filariasis. The study aimed to profile EV release across all life stages of the parasite, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male, and female worms. Using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, the researchers found that all life stages release EVs, which are internalized by murine macrophages through phagocytosis. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, indicating sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo.

The study also found that ivermectin, a commonly used anti-filarial drug, rapidly inhibits EV release by all Brugia life stages. This effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate of that parasite. The findings suggest a potential mechanism of action for ivermectin and highlight the need for new screening platforms for anti-filarial drug development. The study contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms by which filarial nematodes modulate host biology and may lead to the development of new treatments for Lymphatic Filariasis.
A recent population-based survey conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found that scabies and impetigo are highly prevalent in the region. The study, which included 1908 participants from ten rural villages, reported a total unweighted prevalence of scabies at 19.2% and active impetigo at 32.7%. The prevalence of scabies was highest in infants under one year of age, at 34.1%, and in children aged 1-4 years, at 25.7%. Impetigo prevalence was also highest in children aged 1-4 years, at 42.6%. The study found a strong association between scabies infestation and active impetigo infection, with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. Scabies infestation was found to be a significant risk factor for the development of active impetigo. The prevalence of scabies and impetigo in the Solomon Islands is consistent with other studies in the Pacific region, which have reported some of the highest prevalence figures in the world. These conditions place a significant burden on the communities, with clinical management of individual cases consuming a substantial proportion of limited health resources. The study highlights the need for community control strategies for scabies to reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.
Researchers have discovered a link between T cells and cellular proliferation in the adult hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in learning and memory. Using a large group of outbred mice, the study found a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. This correlation was driven by genetic factors, with specific genetic loci influencing both T cell subsets and cellular proliferation.

The study suggests that CD4+ T cells, or subpopulations thereof, play a key role in mediating the effect of T cells on adult neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are generated in the adult brain. The findings indicate that T cells have a broader impact on adult neurogenesis than previously thought, and that natural genetic variation that controls T cell development and homeostasis has an organismal impact.

The study used a large stock of outbred mice to examine the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. The researchers found that higher levels of hippocampal proliferation were associated with a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells and lower proportions of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. The correlation between T cell phenotypes and cellular proliferation was significant, accounting for about 6% of the phenotypic variance. The study's findings provide new insights into the role of T cells in adult neurogenesis and highlight the importance of natural genetic variation in shaping the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine, TcVac2, to combat Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. The vaccine is a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine that targets specific antigens identified through computational analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi sequence database. In a murine model, mice were immunized with TcVac2 and then challenged with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. The results showed that TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, the antibody response persisted, but the CD8+ T cell response and type 1 cytokines subsided, and type 2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-10) became dominant in vaccinated mice. Histological analysis revealed that the tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated chronic mice were undetectable. In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi with a mixed antibody, T cell, and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. The study demonstrates that TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection and prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Researchers have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but a remaining challenge is quantifying individual disease risk based on genotype data. To address this, scientists applied a machine-learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to a large dataset of T1D cases and controls. They optimized a risk assessment model using hundreds of genetic markers and tested it on two independent datasets, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 in both. In contrast, using only a limited number of known susceptibility loci resulted in poor performance. The study suggests that using algorithms that consider interactions between a large ensemble of markers can improve disease risk assessment. This approach may be feasible for diseases where a significant proportion of the risk has already been captured by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The researchers tested the SVM algorithm and logistic regression on three large T1D datasets and found that the SVM achieved satisfactory performance when using hundreds of SNPs, with AUC scores of approximately 0.84. The study's results indicate that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be a viable approach for T1D and potentially other complex diseases.
Memory CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in providing protective immunity against viral infections in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin. However, the fate of these cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues during a secondary infection was not well understood. Researchers investigated the role of central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells in the skin during Vaccinia virus (VacV) infection. They found that TCM CD8+ T cells traffic into the skin independently of CD62L-mediated lymph node re-activation and provide robust protective immunity against VacV infection. In contrast to effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells, TCM CD8+ T cells differentiated into functional CD69+/CD103- tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local recognition of antigen in the skin microenvironment. These tissue residents expressed granzyme B and utilized cytolysis to provide protective immunity against VacV infection. The study demonstrates that TCM CD8+ T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and subsequently differentiate into functional CD69+ tissue-residents. This research provides new insights into the protective mechanisms used by circulating memory CD8+ T cells during a secondary viral infection in peripheral tissues. The findings also have implications for the development of "prime-boost" vaccination strategies to generate antigen-specific secondary memory T cell populations in non-lymphoid tissues.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for Myosin VI, a type of motor protein, in the localization of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. Axons and dendrites, the two main extensions of neurons, have distinct molecular compositions and functions, but the mechanisms behind this polarization are not well understood. Myosin VI, which moves towards the minus end of actin filaments, was found to play a vital role in enriching proteins on the surface of axons. When a non-neuronal protein was engineered to interact with Myosin VI, it became highly concentrated on the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Conversely, disrupting Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant localization of axonal proteins to dendrites. The study suggests that Myosin VI stimulates dendrite-specific endocytosis, a process that contributes to the localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a modified version of the protein Channelrhodopsin 2, engineered to bind to Myosin VI, was found to be concentrated on the surface of axons in mice in vivo, indicating its potential as a tool for studying circuit structure and function. Overall, the findings indicate that myosins, including Myosin VI, play a key role in shaping the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, which is essential for proper electrical signaling in neurons.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes in the freshwater branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, a species that can produce males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, DapmaDsx1, is responsible for male trait development when expressed during environmental sex determination. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of Dsx in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for the sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 differs from that of insects. In Daphnia, DapmaDsx1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in the abundance of its transcripts, with increased expression in males during embryogenesis. Knockdown of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, while ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos led to the development of male-like phenotypes. Another Dsx gene, DapmaDsx2, was also identified, but its silencing and overexpression did not induce clear phenotypic changes. These findings establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype in Daphnia. The study reveals how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination. The results suggest an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against genital herpes, a common sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The vaccine, known as the trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine, targets three key proteins on the virus: glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, and gE2). These proteins play a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect cells and evade the immune system. The vaccine was tested in two animal models: rhesus macaques and guinea pigs.

In rhesus macaques, the vaccine induced the production of neutralizing antibodies, which block the virus from entering cells, as well as antibodies that prevent the virus from evading the immune system. The vaccine also stimulated the activation of CD4 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting off infections. When the macaques were challenged with the virus, those that received the vaccine showed a self-limited vaginal infection, whereas those that did not receive the vaccine developed a more severe infection.

In guinea pigs, the vaccine was highly effective in preventing genital lesions, with 97% efficacy in the trivalent vaccine group and 99% efficacy in the group that received a booster dose of gD2 in addition to the trivalent vaccine. The vaccine also reduced the shedding of the virus in the vagina, with the trivalent vaccine group showing no shedding of replication-competent virus on 0.2% of days. These results suggest that the trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine has the potential to prevent genital herpes in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-seq to map protein-DNA interactions in regions of the genome that are difficult to study due to their repetitive nature. These regions, known as segmental duplications, play a significant role in cells' regulatory programs. Traditional methods for analyzing protein-DNA interactions, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), struggle to accurately map interactions in these regions because short reads from these areas can map to multiple locations in the reference genome.

The Perm-seq method uses additional data types, including DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq, to improve the accuracy of read mapping in these regions. By incorporating this prior information, Perm-seq can allocate multi-mapping reads with high accuracy, reducing false positive and negative rates. The method was comprehensively evaluated and found to significantly improve multi-read allocation accuracy compared to approaches that do not use additional data types.

Perm-seq was applied to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from two cell types, GM12878 and K562, and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Analysis of these interactions revealed that, despite being less conserved evolutionarily, they share similar sequence characteristics with protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions. The Perm-seq framework is highly versatile and can incorporate multiple sources of data, including histone ChIP-seq, for read allocation. This method has the potential to expand the capability of ChIP-seq experiments for profiling protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome.
Researchers conducted a study in Tanzania to investigate the relationship between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects 218 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa. The study found that women with schistosomiasis were 2.8 times more likely to become infected with HIV-1 than those without the infection. In contrast, men with schistosomiasis did not have an increased risk of HIV-1 infection. The study also found that women with schistosomiasis who became infected with HIV-1 had higher levels of the virus in their blood at the time of infection compared to women without schistosomiasis. This suggests that schistosomiasis may impair the immune system's ability to control HIV-1 infection in women.

The study analyzed dried blood spots from a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania. The researchers tested the blood spots for schistosome antigens and compared the results between people who became infected with HIV-1 and those who did not. The study found that schistosomiasis increased the susceptibility of women to HIV-1 infection and raised the viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schistosome infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, and to show that the effects differ between men and women. The findings have important implications for understanding the relationship between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection, particularly in areas where both infections are common.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and cancer. rDNA is a highly variable region in the human genome that plays a crucial role in cellular function. Despite its importance, little was known about the factors governing its copy number, stability, and sequence in the mammalian genome. To address this knowledge gap, scientists used computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes.

The study found that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes showed a loss of rDNA copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. This loss of copies was also observed in hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a mouse model for leukemia, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the study found that cancer genomes with lower rDNA copies had mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity.

The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor that regulates genome stability and the mTOR kinase pathway, was found to be associated with the loss of rDNA copies. The study suggests that rDNA copy number may be a useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments. The findings also imply that targeting rDNA loci may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cancers associated with mTOR activation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between rDNA copy number and cancer, and highlights the potential for using rDNA copy number as a biomarker for cancer treatment.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the behavior of bacteria within the body during an infection. They used a technique called quantitative PCR to track the growth, death, and spread of tagged Salmonella bacteria in mice. This allowed them to estimate the rate of bacterial death and understand how the bacteria interact with the host's immune system.

The study found that shortly after infection, the bacteria rapidly multiply and establish separate populations in different organs, such as the spleen and liver. This process is controlled by the host's antimicrobial mechanisms. As the infection progresses, the rate of bacterial death decreases, leading to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria. The bacteria then spread locally and mix between organs through the bloodstream, resulting in further selection of bacterial subpopulations.

This research provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections, highlighting the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive the disease. The approach used in this study can be applied to other host-pathogen combinations, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the within-host dynamics of infectious diseases. By using genetically identical bacterial strains, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the individual events that shape the global profile of population dynamics during infection. This knowledge can be used to build mechanistic mathematical models, generate new research hypotheses, and make quantitative predictions about the behavior of pathogens within the body.
Existing models of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity, are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion. Researchers suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, two plausible default strategies are proposed: the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D, and the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion allows for the distinction between these strategies of 3D motion processing. Theoretical results indicate that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are necessary to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. Parallel processing and late integration of motion and disparity, as well as other cues, appear to be a convincing approach to solving the inverse problem for local 3D motion. This approach adds a functional significant aspect to the notion of parallel streams of dynamic disparity and motion processing. The intersection of two constraint planes in a given binocular viewing geometry defines a constraint line oriented in 3D velocity space, providing a flexible strategy to disambiguate 3D motion direction and solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception.
Researchers have investigated the role of two proteins, AlgJ and AlgX, in the O-acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form a protective biofilm matrix in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The O-acetylation of alginate is a common modification used by pathogenic organisms to protect against external forces. The researchers determined the structure of AlgJ to 1.83 Å resolution and found that it is a SGNH hydrolase-like protein, similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX, but with a distinct electrostatic surface potential. They identified a conserved catalytic triad in AlgJ and demonstrated its acetylesterase activity in vitro. In contrast, AlgX has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module. The researchers used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays to compare the abilities of AlgJ and AlgX to bind and acetylate alginate. They found that AlgJ exhibits weak or no detectable polymer binding, while AlgX binds polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, AlgX can utilize a surrogate acetyl-donor to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid. The results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX acting as the terminal acetyltransferase. This study provides a refined model for alginate acetylation and sheds light on the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation.
Candida albicans, a common cause of human fungal infections, can evade detection by the immune system by masking its cell wall component β(1,3)-glucan with an outer layer of mannoproteins. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β(1,3)-glucan, making it detectable by the immune system through receptors like Dectin-1. Research has shown that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) plays a role in β(1,3)-glucan masking, and a mutant lacking the PS synthase enzyme (Cho1) exhibits increased exposure of β(1,3)-glucan. Further investigation revealed that the Cek1 MAPK pathway is activated in this mutant and is responsible for unmasking β(1,3)-glucan. The Cek1 pathway is activated downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, which are involved in cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells also leads to increased β(1,3)-glucan exposure and activation of the Cek1 pathway. Additionally, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 leads to Cek1 activation and increased β(1,3)-glucan exposure. These findings suggest that upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway is responsible for unmasking β(1,3)-glucan in the Cho1 mutant and may play a role in unmasking in wild-type cells. This discovery could have implications for improving anti-fungal strategies by enhancing the detection of fungal cell wall antigens by the immune system.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study using data from 4,914 brain autopsies to investigate the genetic factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The study aimed to identify genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features of AD, such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs), as well as co-morbid changes like cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI).

The study found genome-wide significance for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD. Variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) were strongly associated with these features. Additionally, the study identified new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features, including GALNT7, ABCG1, and KCNMB2, which were linked to NPs, HS, and VBI, respectively.

Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in the study, including CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4. Nine of these loci showed larger odds ratios in the clinico-pathologic sample. The study also found a positive correlation between the effect sizes for risk of AD dementia and NFTs or NPs, and a moderate negative correlation with VBI. The findings suggest that genetic risk loci for AD dementia are associated with specific neuropathologic features, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these characteristic lesions.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein folding and unfolding, but the exact role of urea in this process has remained unclear. A recent study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of urea on 30 proteins with different native folds, secondary structures, and disulfide bridges. The results show that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of proteins, but with a lower density than in the fully unfolded state. This suggests that urea does not simply stabilize the unfolded state, but rather plays an active role in the unfolding process.

The study found that urea's van der Waals interactions drive its accumulation on the surface of folded proteins, while hydrogen bonding is crucial for stabilizing long-lived urea interactions near hinge points. These interactions bias the protein's intrinsic dynamics towards unfolding. The results indicate that urea does not favor the formation of partially open microstates, but rather selects and stabilizes them, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble away from the native state.

The study's findings provide a comprehensive understanding of urea's role in destabilizing folded states and accelerating protein unfolding. The results suggest that urea's denaturing properties are not solely due to its ability to interact with exposed protein residues more strongly than water, as previously thought. Instead, urea's stickiness and slow diffusion play a crucial role in unfolding, particularly in stabilizing partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations.
A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia from 2000 to 2011. The review identified 30 studies that met the inclusion criteria, revealing a stable "baseline" annual number of dengue fever cases, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue cases recorded during the review period were among those under 15 years of age.

The review found that the incidence of dengue disease was generally low in south and south-east Colombia, likely due to the region's low population density. Nationwide surveillance data showed a 90% increase in the number of municipalities reporting dengue cases between 2000 and 2010. The incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) showed a general increase between 2000 and 2010, followed by a significant decrease in 2011.

The review highlighted gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia, including the rates of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary and secondary dengue virus infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved surveillance methods and a better understanding of the factors that determine disease expression are necessary to improve disease control and management. This review is part of a series examining the epidemiology of dengue disease in selected countries in the Americas and Asia, providing an overview of the changing epidemiology of the disease over a decade or more.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL), a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, often co-occurs with other pathogens in human populations. This review examines the frequency of TL coinfections, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and the implications for clinical practice. A comprehensive search of medical literature identified 73 records, including 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies on human subjects. The review found that coinfections with Trypanosoma cruzi (41% in Argentina) and helminthiasis (15-88% in Brazil) are common in TL patients. However, the mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms are not well understood and may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting the quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and may reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment. Some coinfections, such as helminthiasis, can also cause cumulative adverse effects when combined with antileishmanial drugs. The review highlights the need for further research to understand how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. They used two genetic models, the NIH-Heterogenous Stock (HS) and a panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, to map Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio. The study identified 10 QTLs across the genome and found that QTLs for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC.

The researchers refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals of approximately 0.25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions and found that an interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression and negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes. They mapped this effect to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (s) (RT1-A) in the MHC-I region. The interaction was revealed by a recombination between RT1-A and Tap2, which occurred in 0.2% of the rats.

Variants of Tap2 have previously been shown to influence the antigenicity of MHC class I molecules by altering the MHC class I ligandome. The study found that a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells. This is the first study to show how a recombination between natural alleles of genes in the MHC influences lineage commitment of T cells.
Researchers analyzed hospital discharge records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to understand the evolution of Chagas disease in the country. Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America, and Spain is the European country with the highest expected number of infected patients due to its large migrant population from Latin America. The study found that hospitalization rates for Chagas disease increased from 18 per 100,000 population in 1997-2004 to 242.8 per 100,000 population in 2005-2011. The majority of hospitalizations (75.3%) were related to Chagas disease without organ complications, while 23.4% involved organ complications, with heart complications being the most common. The study also found that being male, aged 45-64 years, and having a higher hospitalization cost were associated with a higher risk of organ complications. The majority of patients (74%) were female, and the 16-45 age group was most represented. The study highlights the need for increased efforts towards early detection and control of Chagas disease in Spain, particularly among asymptomatic women of childbearing age.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called BlocBuster to identify combinatorial interactions of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases, such as psoriasis. This method efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that accurately segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and tests their associations with a given phenotype. BlocBuster was applied to analyze psoriasis data and discovered a combinatorial pattern of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. This pattern was significantly associated with psoriasis, with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16. The results were replicated in independent data, demonstrating the robustness of the method.

The BlocBuster approach improves upon previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern within the MHC region, which is an exceptionally diverse genomic area. In contrast, individual SNPs examined in isolation showed smaller effects, with the highest odds ratio being 2.41. The novel combinatorial pattern identified by BlocBuster has the potential to improve the prediction of disease susceptibility and broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis underlying psoriasis. This study demonstrates the potential of BlocBuster to discover combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, thereby transcending the limitations of individual markers examined in isolation.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic causes of three severe congenital brain malformations: agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG). They analyzed chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, as well as 2,349 control individuals. The study found that patients with ACC had a significantly higher prevalence of rare genic CNVs, which are CNVs that affect at least one gene in less than 1% of the population, compared to controls. Specifically, 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which are CNVs that occur for the first time in a family and are not inherited from parents. These de novo CNVs were more likely to overlap with those previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders.

The study also found that ACC patients had a higher burden of large, gene-rich CNVs, particularly deletions, compared to controls. In contrast, the burden of rare CNVs was not significantly different in patients with CBLH or PMG compared to controls. The researchers identified six novel CNVs, each in a single patient, that are likely deleterious. One patient with ACC and microcephaly had a paternally inherited deletion of 16p13.11 that included the NDE1 gene, and exome sequencing revealed a recessive maternally inherited nonsense mutation in the non-deleted allele of NDE1. This study is the first systematic investigation of CNVs in congenital brain malformations and highlights the complexity of ACC genetics.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called Yorkie (Yki) in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm. Planarians have the ability to regrow lost body parts, making them an ideal model for studying regeneration. The study found that when Yki is inhibited, the planarian's response to injury is hyper-activated, leading to increased stem cell proliferation and a prolonged transcriptional wound response. This means that the planarian's cells are more active and produce more genes in response to injury.

The researchers also found that the inhibition of Yki leads to an increase in the number of epidermal and muscle cells, which are the sources of wound-induced genes. However, the planarian's ability to sense the size of an injury and remodel its body accordingly is impaired. The study suggests that Yki plays a key role in integrating multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning.

The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit Yki in planarians and observed the effects on their regeneration. They found that Yki is not expressed in stem cells, but its inhibition leads to an increase in the stem cell response through extrinsic signals. The study also identified novel wound-induced genes that are de-repressed in Yki-inhibited planarians.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of Yki in planarian regeneration and suggests that it is a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of the injury response. The findings have implications for our understanding of regeneration and tissue repair in animals.
Researchers have found that exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, play a significant role in the transmission of the EV71 virus. When EV71 infects a cell, it triggers the release of exosomes that contain viral RNA and a specific microRNA called miR-146a. This microRNA is known to suppress the type I interferon response, which is the body's first line of defense against viral infections. By suppressing this response, the exosomal miR-146a facilitates the replication of the EV71 virus in the recipient cell.

The study found that exosomes released by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which is then transferred to and facilitates the replication of the viral RNA in the recipient cell. The researchers also discovered that the IFN-stimulated gene factors, BST-2/tetherin, are involved in regulating the upregulation of exosome secretion in response to EV71 infection.

In vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA accumulates differently in various tissues compared to free virus particles. The findings of this study provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package miR-146a, which can be functionally transferred to and facilitate the replication of exosomal EV71 RNA in the recipient cells by suppressing the type I interferon response. This research highlights the complex role of exosomes in the transmission and replication of the EV71 virus.
Researchers studied the relationship between two genes, PINK1 and Parkin, which are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. PINK1 is a protein that helps maintain healthy mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, while Parkin is a protein that helps remove damaged mitochondria through a process called mitophagy. However, the exact mechanism by which PINK1 and Parkin interact to maintain mitochondrial health is not well understood. To investigate this, the researchers identified a protein called PGAM5 that binds to PINK1 and found that it plays a crucial role in regulating the PINK1 pathway. They used fruit flies (Drosophila) as a model organism to study the relationship between PINK1, Parkin, and PGAM5. The results showed that loss of PGAM5 suppressed the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by inactivation of PINK1 in the flies. However, inactivation of PGAM5 did not affect the phenotypes associated with Parkin mutations. Conversely, overexpression of PGAM5 exacerbated the phenotypes associated with both PINK1 and Parkin mutations. These findings suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway and plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial health. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease and highlights the potential of PGAM5 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the immune response against Mycobacterium ulcerans, the bacteria responsible for Buruli ulcer, a chronic skin disease. The study used an experimental mouse model to compare the progression of the infection in mice with and without IFN-γ. The results showed that mice lacking IFN-γ had a faster and more severe progression of the disease, with more extensive tissue damage and a higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This suggests that IFN-γ plays a crucial role in early immune defense against M. ulcerans by activating macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria.

The study's findings support the idea that the immune response against M. ulcerans is similar to that against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a closely related pathogen. However, M. ulcerans produces a toxin called mycolactone, which can kill host cells and contribute to the disease's characteristic necrotizing pathology. The study's results indicate that IFN-γ is essential for containing the infection during its early stages, before the formation of extracellular clusters of mycolactone-producing bacteria.

The study's findings have implications for the development of vaccines against Buruli ulcer. Previous studies have shown that Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination can provide some protection against M. ulcerans infection, and the results of this study suggest that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be applicable to Buruli ulcer. Overall, the study highlights the importance of IFN-γ in early immune defense against M. ulcerans infection and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism behind the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which is a major contributor to various systemic diseases. They found that the respiratory complex III in mitochondria can operate in two distinct modes: a low ROS-producing mode and a high ROS-producing mode. Normally, complex III operates in the low ROS-producing mode, but under conditions of temporary anoxia (lack of oxygen), it can switch to the high ROS-producing mode. This switch persists even after oxygen supply is restored, leading to increased ROS production and potentially causing cell damage. The researchers developed a new methodology to mathematically model the electron transport process in mitochondria, which allowed them to identify this bistability in complex III. Their model predicts that various perturbations, such as the presence of ADP or episodes of anoxia, can induce the transition between these two modes. Experimental data confirmed the existence of these two modes and the ability to switch between them. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of anoxia-induced cell damage and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. The developed methodology can be applied to other complex bioenergetic systems, enabling a more detailed mathematical analysis of their behavior.
Researchers studied the role of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) in the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They used a systems-level approach to analyze the regulatory effect of hkb on gap gene expression, which is crucial for specifying the position of body segments in the early embryo. The team presented quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein, allowing them to include hkb in gap gene circuit models. These models are mathematical representations of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial expression data. By fitting the model to gap gene expression patterns, the researchers obtained estimates for regulatory parameters that predict a specific network topology.

The models showed that hkb is involved in regulating the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, but does not have any other essential function. Specifically, hkb is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of this domain, which is now reproduced correctly in the models. Additionally, the models were able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, whereas previous models were unable to do so. As a result, the current models capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.
Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy for Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective treatment or biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy, and infected animals remain carriers for life. Two live attenuated vaccine strains, S19 and RB51, have been used, but they have limitations. S19 induces only antibody responses, which are ineffective against intracellular pathogens, while RB51 induces cell-mediated immunity but is resistant to the antibiotic rifampicin. Both strains can be secreted in milk and infect humans, causing abortions in animals.

The researchers used phage lysates, which retain maximum immunogenicity, to develop a new immunotherapy. Phage lysates of RB51 (RL) and S19 (SL) were tested on Brucellosis-affected cattle. The results showed that SL induced a strong antibody response, while RL stimulated cell-mediated immunity. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from RL-immunized cattle induced interferon-gamma production.

A single subcutaneous dose of a cocktail lysate (both RL and SL) eliminated live virulent Brucella from infected cattle within three months. The plasma level of Brucella-specific 223 bp amplicon was undetectable by RT-PCR, and the blood was negative for live Brucella by culture. This is the first report on the use of RB51 phage lysate for successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle and the minimally invasive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy using plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker.
Researchers have investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in responding to DNA damage in human cells. CDKs are essential for cell cycle progression, but also play a role in repairing damaged DNA. However, it has been challenging to determine the specific functions of individual CDKs in maintaining genomic integrity. To address this, scientists replaced the wild-type Cdk2 gene with a mutant version that is sensitive to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs. This allowed them to selectively inhibit Cdk2 activity in human cells. The results showed that transient inhibition of Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhanced cell killing, indicating a specific requirement for Cdk2 activity in responding to DNA damage.

Further investigation revealed that Cdk2 phosphorylates the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome gene product Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. This phosphorylation is dependent on a consensus CDK recognition site at Ser432. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. These findings demonstrate a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and identify Nbs1 as a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to create maps of open chromatin in two types of blood cells: megakaryocytes and erythroblastoid cells. These cells are involved in the production of platelets, which play a crucial role in blood clotting. The researchers focused on genetic loci associated with hematological traits, such as platelet count, and cardiovascular traits, such as coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. They found that the two cell types had distinct patterns of open chromatin, which are regions of the genome where genes are actively being expressed.

The researchers identified a specific region on chromosome 7q22.3 that was open in megakaryocytes but not erythroblastoid cells. This region contained a common non-coding sequence variant, rs342293, which is associated with platelet volume and function. By resequencing this region in 643 individuals, they found that rs342293 was the only putative causative variant. Further analysis revealed that the C- and G-alleles of rs342293 differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting the expression of the PIK3CG gene in platelets and macrophages. The PIK3CG gene is involved in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation.

The researchers also identified six other putative functional variants associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits that fall into open chromatin. These findings suggest that the intersection of maps of open chromatin with variants identified through genome-wide association studies can facilitate the search for underlying functional variants. The study provides a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding genome-wide association index SNP modulates platelet phenotype.
Researchers used computer simulations to study the effects of blocking a persistent sodium current (INaP) in respiratory circuits. This current is thought to play a crucial role in rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC), a group of neurons responsible for controlling breathing. Two commonly used blockers, tetrodotoxin (TTX) and riluzole (RZ), were used to block INaP, but they have different mechanisms of action. TTX directly blocks the sodium channel, while RZ shifts the inactivation of the channel in the hyperpolarizing direction.

The simulations showed that the effects of blocking INaP with TTX and RZ are not equivalent, and that RZ may not effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network. This is because RZ's mechanism of action allows INaP to be reactivated by transient hyperpolarizing perturbations. In contrast, TTX completely blocks INaP and stops respiratory rhythm generation. The simulations also showed that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP, and that experimental TTX application in the intact network is predicted to terminate respiratory rhythmicity.

The study provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block and suggests that the effects of INaP block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations. The results support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and highlight the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.
Researchers have identified a microRNA called miR-218 that plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of gastric cancer (GC) to other parts of the body. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to specific messenger RNA molecules. In GC, the expression of miR-218 is decreased, which leads to an increase in the expression of the Robo1 receptor. The Robo1 receptor is part of a signaling pathway that promotes the spread of cancer cells. When miR-218 binds to the Robo1 receptor, it suppresses its activity, preventing the spread of cancer cells. However, when miR-218 levels are low, the Robo1 receptor is no longer suppressed, allowing the signaling pathway to be activated and promoting the spread of cancer cells. The researchers found that restoring miR-218 levels in GC cells suppressed the activity of the Robo1 receptor and reduced the ability of the cells to invade and metastasize. This suggests that targeting miR-218 may be a potential strategy for blocking the spread of GC. The study also identified a regulatory circuit involving miR-218, the Slit-Robo1 pathway, and the Robo1 receptor, which may contribute to the spread of GC. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of GC metastasis and highlight the potential of miR-218 as a therapeutic target.
Researchers have identified a network of genes that play a crucial role in preventing the formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques when plasma cholesterol levels are lowered. Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, which can lead to coronary artery disease and stroke. To investigate the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development, researchers used a mouse model with a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins. The study found that atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then rapidly expanded and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of the lesion expression profiles revealed that the accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation.

Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol prevented the formation of advanced plaques, and transcriptional profiling of the atherosclerotic arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. These genes, including PVRL2 and HSDL2, are potential targets for therapies to prevent the formation of advanced plaques. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis development and identifies a network of genes that can be targeted to prevent the formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the cell envelope in Gram-negative bacteria. The cell envelope is a critical barrier that is difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate, making it challenging to treat infections caused by these bacteria. The new screening method, called the CPRG screen, was used to analyze an ordered single-gene deletion library of Escherichia coli and identified 102 genes of unknown function that likely impact envelope biogenesis. One of these genes, ElyC (YcbC), was further characterized and found to play a crucial role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. This discovery highlights the potential of the CPRG screen to uncover new information about the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and identify vulnerabilities in the system that can be targeted by drugs. The screening method is also adaptable to other organisms, allowing researchers to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures. Further analysis of ElyC and other genes identified in the screen is expected to reveal new mechanisms underlying the envelope assembly process, which could lead to the development of new treatments for Gram-negative bacterial infections. The discovery of ElyC as a new envelope biogenesis factor validates the utility of the CPRG screening approach and has important implications for our understanding of envelope biogenesis and the development of new antimicrobial therapies.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze complex biological systems by combining multiple types of data into a single, integrated view. This method, called semi-supervised learning, allows for the fusion of heterogeneous datasets, such as gene expression, protein localization, and tissue morphogenesis, into a continuous trajectory. The approach was tested using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, and revealed the joint dynamics of five molecular components involved in the development of the embryo's dorsal-ventral axis.

The researchers used a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train the semi-supervised learning model, resulting in a multivariable trajectory that shows how the different components interact and change over time. This approach can be applied to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further analysis and modeling of biological dynamics. The method has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological processes, such as developmental pattern formation, by integrating multiple types of data into a single, coherent view.

The researchers used a dataset of approximately 1,000 images, each showing the spatial position of nuclei and the distribution of one or several components of the dorsal-ventral patterning network. By applying the semi-supervised learning approach, they were able to compute pairwise similarities between the images and reconstruct the multivariable dynamics of the system. The resulting trajectories provide a basis for further mechanistic studies of the complex processes involved in developmental pattern formation.
Researchers compared three types of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) from the PI, PII, and PIII classes to understand how they contribute to hemorrhage. These enzymes, found in snake venom, break down the extracellular matrix, a network of proteins and fibers that provides structure and support to tissues. The study found that PII and PIII SVMPs localized to microvessels, such as capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules, and co-localized with type IV collagen, a key component of the extracellular matrix. In contrast, the PI SVMP had a more widespread distribution in the tissue.

The researchers also analyzed how these enzymes broke down different components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen. They found that PII and PIII SVMPs showed similar patterns of type IV collagen degradation, which is critical for destabilizing microvessel structure and leading to hemorrhage. However, the patterns of degradation for laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen varied among the three enzymes.

Proteomic analysis of wound exudate, or fluid that leaks from damaged tissue, revealed differences in the effects of the three SVMPs. The PI enzyme showed higher levels of proteolysis, or protein breakdown, of several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clotting. In contrast, exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs contained higher amounts of intracellular proteins. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage.
A noncoding RNA called iab-8 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the homeotic gene abd-A in Drosophila melanogaster. The abd-A gene is responsible for the development of the eighth abdominal segment, and its expression is normally repressed by the Abdominal-B (Abd-B) gene. However, in the absence of Abd-B, abd-A is ectopically expressed in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. A 92 kb noncoding RNA, iab-8, is responsible for repressing abd-A in neuronal cells. This repression is achieved through two mechanisms: the production of a microRNA that acts in trans to repress abd-A, and a cis-repressive function that acts only on the chromosome from which the iab-8 RNA is transcribed. The cis-repressive function is thought to be due to transcriptional interference, where the iab-8 RNA interferes with the abd-A promoter. This interference is supported by the fact that rearrangements that truncate the iab-8 RNA near its start site cause a dramatic derepression of abd-A in the central nervous system of the eighth abdominal segment. The iab-8 RNA is transcribed from a 90 kb-long transcription unit that extends between Abd-B and abd-A, with a likely start site within the iab-8 regulatory region.
Researchers have studied the onset patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity originating from a specific area of the brain. Two distinct patterns have been identified: low amplitude fast (LAF) and high amplitude slow (HAS) oscillations. A computational model of neocortical tissue was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these patterns. The model was validated using clinical recordings of focal seizures and was able to reproduce the two onset patterns in their defining properties.

The study found that LAF onset is initiated by localized patches of activity that slowly invade surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of surrounding tissue, which does not generate seizures on its own but can support seizure activity when triggered.

The model suggests that the excitability of surrounding tissue plays a crucial role in determining the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcome. The study also demonstrated that changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying focal seizures and may have implications for the development of more effective treatments. The model was able to reproduce not only the initial onset pattern but also the evolution of the seizure, including the growing amplitude in the LAF pattern. However, the model did not simulate the termination of the seizure.
In flowering plants, sperm cells are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube, a structure formed by the male gametophyte. Upon arrival at the female gametophyte, two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. Researchers have recently identified the first players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and arrest their growth. However, the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and sperm discharge remained unclear. This study investigated the role of defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins, ZmES1-4, from maize, which are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. The researchers found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner and is released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. ZmES4 interacts with the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1, causing it to open and allowing K+ influx. This influx leads to water uptake and culminates in osmotic tube burst. The study suggests that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants. The findings provide new insights into the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst, shedding light on the complex process of fertilization in flowering plants.
Researchers have developed an oncolytic herpesvirus, R-LM249, that specifically targets and kills cancer cells expressing high levels of the HER-2 protein, which is overexpressed in certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. The virus, retargeted to HER-2, was tested in mouse models that mimic the spread of cancer to the peritoneum, a common outcome in advanced ovarian and breast cancer patients. The results showed that intraperitoneal administration of R-LM249 significantly inhibited the growth of ovarian and breast cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity, with 60% of mice remaining free from peritoneal diffusion and a 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. The virus also reduced the growth of ovarian and breast cancer metastases in the brain. Notably, R-LM249 was effective against HER-2-positive cancer cells that were resistant to the commonly used cancer treatment trastuzumab. The study demonstrates the potential of R-LM249 as a preclinical therapy for disseminated HER-2-positive ovarian and breast carcinomas. The results suggest that intraperitoneal administration of R-LM249 could be an effective treatment option for patients with advanced ovarian and breast cancer that has spread to the peritoneal cavity. Further research is needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of R-LM249 in human clinical trials.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates the duplication of centrosomes in yeast cells. Centrosomes, which serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle, must duplicate only once per cell cycle to ensure proper chromosome segregation and bipolar spindle formation. The study found that a protein called Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, is the first known substrate of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) that restricts centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. Phosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 promotes the separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and prevents premature reduplication of SPBs during mitosis. Conversely, the protein phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1, allowing for the licensing of SPBs for the next cycle of duplication. The study suggests that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 has a dual function: promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. This mechanism is essential for maintaining genome stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which is commonly observed in cancers. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of centrosome duplication and highlight the importance of Sfi1 as a key player in this process.
Researchers have investigated the role of viral protein R (Vpr) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Vpr is a protein encoded by HIV-1 that has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in infected cells in laboratory experiments. However, its role in HIV-1 infection in living organisms has not been well understood. To study Vpr's role in HIV-1 infection, researchers used a humanized mouse model, where human cells are transplanted into mice. They infected these mice with HIV-1 that either had or did not have the Vpr protein. The results showed that Vpr causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a specific type of immune cell called regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for controlling the immune response. This leads to a depletion of Tregs and an increase in virus production during the early stages of HIV-1 infection. The study found that this effect is specific to a type of HIV-1 that uses the CCR5 receptor to enter cells, but not to a type that uses the CXCR4 receptor. The researchers also found that Tregs are more susceptible to Vpr's effects because they are in a higher state of cell division than other immune cells. This suggests that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating Tregs to enhance the replication of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The study's findings provide new insights into the role of Vpr in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS.
Researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of Plasmodium vivax, the parasite responsible for vivax malaria, in South Korea from 1994 to 2008. They used microsatellite DNA markers to study the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasite. The study found a drastic genetic change in the South Korean P. vivax population between 2002 and 2003. This change was not due to relapse or asymptomatic parasite carriage, but rather the introduction of new parasite strains from other sources. One possible source of these new strains is North Korea. The study suggests that molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA markers is a useful tool for understanding the population structure and transmission dynamics of P. vivax. This information can aid in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas. The researchers increased the number of microsatellite DNA loci and the sample size of P. vivax parasites compared to a previous study, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the parasite population. The study found a gradual decrease in linkage disequilibrium levels and an increase in genetic diversity, indicating a shift in the parasite population. The findings have implications for malaria control efforts in South Korea, where the number of vivax malaria cases fluctuated significantly between 2004 and 2011.
A recent study has shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of transcription by a splicing-competent intron in eukaryotes. The research reveals that the intron plays a crucial role in regulating promoter directionality, favoring the transcription of mRNA over upstream anti-sense transcripts. Using strand-specific transcription run-on analysis, the study found that the presence of an intron promotes the transcription of mRNA, while mutation of the 5' or 3' splice site reverses promoter directionality. This suggests that the entire splicing-competent intron, not just the 5' splice site, regulates transcription directionality.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region is dependent on the presence of an intron. Removal of the intron or mutation of the splice sites impairs the promoter localization of termination factors, leading to a loss of transcription directionality. The study also found that gene looping, a process facilitated by the intron, is essential for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene. In a looping-defective mutant, the promoter occupancy of termination factors was compromised, resulting in a loss of transcription directionality.

These findings suggest that the intron-dependent gene looping places terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region, terminating upstream anti-sense transcription and conferring promoter directionality. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of transcription by a splicing-competent intron and highlights the importance of gene looping in regulating transcription directionality in eukaryotes.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor called ZBED6, which plays a crucial role in regulating muscle growth and development in placental mammals. ZBED6 is derived from a domesticated DNA transposon and is specific to placental mammals. A mutation in the IGF2 gene in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 expression in skeletal muscle, resulting in increased muscle growth, heart size, and fat deposition. The researchers found that ZBED6 binds to the IGF2 gene and represses its expression, and silencing ZBED6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affects Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed over 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif that matches the established binding site in IGF2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites are enriched for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The researchers also found that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.

The study suggests that ZBED6's ability to interact with chromatin and affect transcriptional regulation is a function derived from its ancestral transposase. ZBED6 is localized to the nucleolus, where it may mediate transcriptional silencing by moving the IGF2 locus and other targets to the nucleolus. The researchers identified over 1,000 genes putatively regulated by ZBED6 in the mouse, including genes involved in cell proliferation and cancer development.
Researchers have mapped the RNA editome in rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans, using next-generation sequencing technology. The study identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% of these sites in coding regions and 97.5% in non-coding regions. The findings suggest that adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, as A-to-G editing sites are flanked by sequences with attributes of ADAR substrates. The study also found that the sequence context and expression profile of ADARs are relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types.

The researchers used a combination of genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal to create an accurate and quantitative profile of the RNA editome. This approach allowed for a comparative analysis of the editome across different tissues and animals. The study found some intra-population conservation of the macaque editome, as well as parallels of the editome across multiple primate species.

The researchers tested whether the cross-species similarities in RNA editome were maintained by purifying selection due to functional implications or simply due to lower sequence divergences among closely related primate species. They found that the local sequence context of the editing site was important in RNA-editing regulation, and that the editing levels were conserved across different tissues and animals. The study provides an important evolutionary context to understand RNA-editing regulation in humans, emphasizing RNA editing as a form of widespread functional regulation shaped by purifying selection.
Researchers have discovered a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive sensory responses in visual discrimination tasks. In a two-alternative visual discrimination task, observers typically integrate noisy neural responses to determine the likelihood that a stimulus evoked the observed responses. However, a new study reveals that observers do not evaluate likelihood with high precision and instead consider the likelihood of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies, leading to a bias in perceived spatial frequency. The study used spectrally filtered noise to induce an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency, which mainly affects the likelihood of spatial frequencies that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Despite this, observers showed a significant shift in perceived grating frequency, indicating that they evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives.

The study found that filtered visual noise significantly alters the perception of two known gratings in a two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination task, shifting perceived spatial frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high-pass filtered noise conditions, respectively. Observers consider the log likelihood values of spatial frequencies that are a-priori unlikely to occur during the task, which lowers grating detectability and leads to a bias in perceived spatial frequency. The study suggests that observers base their decisions on a combination of veridical grating spatial frequency and the likelihood of irrelevant frequencies, leading to a suboptimal population decoding of sensory responses.
Researchers have identified a key element that regulates the expression of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. piRNAs play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. The study found that each piRNA in C. elegans represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit that requires only a 21-nucleotide piRNA sequence and a specific 50-nucleotide upstream motif for expression. This motif is necessary for the independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. The researchers used a novel, in vivo transgenic system to demonstrate that a single nucleotide position within this motif directs differential germline enrichment. They found that over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and comparison of the genes they target suggests that these two populations have evolved independently. The study reveals that C. elegans piRNA upstream motifs act as independent promoters, specifying which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germline. The researchers also found that the number of transcriptional units encoding piRNAs rivals the number of mRNA coding genes in the C. elegans genome, with over 15,000 unique piRNA sequences.
Researchers have identified a novel host factor, Yip1A, that plays a crucial role in the activation of the IRE1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during Brucella infection. The UPR is a cellular response to stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Brucella species, such as B. abortus, replicate within host cells in ER-derived vacuoles, but the mechanisms by which they acquire the necessary ER-derived membrane for replication were not well understood.

The study found that during Brucella infection, the IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, of the UPR is activated in a time-dependent manner. This activation leads to the upregulation of COPII vesicle components, including Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D, which are involved in the formation of ER-derived vacuoles. The researchers also observed a marked accretion of ER-derived vacuoles around replicating bacteria using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy.

Further investigation revealed that Yip1A is responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites (ERES) under UPR conditions. Knockdown of Yip1A in host cells prevented the formation of ER-derived vacuoles, and Brucella bacteria remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The study suggests that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuoles are critical for Brucella to establish a safe replication niche, and that Yip1A is indispensable for these processes.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) hijack the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to support their replication. Vps34 is recruited into the large viral replication compartment, where it produces PI(3)P phosphoinositide. The kinase function of Vps34 is essential for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P plays a crucial role in building the replication compartment. The expression of Vps34 and PI(3)P is increased in the presence of viral replication proteins, leading to more efficient virus replication. Overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase inhibits TBSV replication on peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on mitochondrial membranes. The purified PI(3)P phosphatase also reduces TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. PI(3)P is enriched in the replication compartment, as detected by antibody or bioprobe. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with the p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in yeast reveals that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. Vps34 and PI(3)P are necessary for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance is decreased.
Researchers conducted a study in Iquitos, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on dengue virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood feeding methods for use in a field-based epidemiological cohort study. Between 2011 and 2015, 58 participants with dengue fever were enrolled in the study. Mosquitoes were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. The mosquitoes were then tested for DENV infection and dissemination after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation.

The results showed that DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between direct and indirect-EDTA feeding methods. However, infection rates were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. The study also found no differences in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding was found to be preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability. The study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild or inapparent disease to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated why some people respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in DNA replication. They used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the genetic basis of this variability. The study found that natural variation in a single amino acid substitution in the topoisomerase II enzyme, specifically a methionine-to-glutamine substitution, is responsible for differences in sensitivity to these drugs. This substitution affects the interaction between the enzyme and the drug etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability in worms with the methionine residue. The researchers also found that this amino acid difference is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms, hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ. This difference influences the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons. The study demonstrates the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses and highlights the potential for personalized treatments based on genetic information.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically African mole-rats, to gain insights into the genetic mechanisms that determine mammalian lifespans. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 genes associated with enhanced longevity. These genes, known as positively selected genes (PSGs), showed an expression pattern in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. This theory proposes that genes with beneficial effects in youth have negative effects in old age.

The PSGs were enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. The researchers also found that PSGs are linked to functional terms relevant to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and regulation by the mTOR pathway. Notably, the PSGs include RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF1, both central components of aging-relevant pathways.

The study's findings suggest that the identified PSGs are associated with expression changes during aging in long- and short-lived rodents, consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. The researchers conclude that their results provide a meaningful resource for follow-up studies to mechanistically link identified genes and amino acids under positive selection to aging and lifespan determination.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to combat Aedes albopictus-borne viruses, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, by introducing the endosymbiont Wolbachia into the mosquito population. A new Aedes albopictus line, ARwP-M, was created by introducing the wMel Wolbachia strain into the ARwP line, which had previously been established by replacing the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia strains with the wPip strain. The researchers studied various infection and fitness parameters of ARwP-M, ARwP, and wild-type Aedes albopictus mosquitoes sharing the same genetic background. The results showed that ARwP-M had a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia, and its survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility did not differ from the other two lines. However, crosses between ARwP-M males and wild-type females were fully unfertile, while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased with the age of the wild-type males. When competing with wild-type males for wild-type females, ARwP-M males induced a higher level of sterility. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15-fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection, which corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses. The researchers also found that none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable of transmitting Zika virus. These findings suggest that the exploitation of Wolbachia could be a promising strategy to suppress wild-type Aedes albopictus populations.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify peptide-mediated interactions between proteins, which are crucial for various biological processes. These interactions occur when a globular domain in one protein recognizes a linear peptide from another protein, creating a small contact interface. Current methods for discovering these interactions rely on the tendency of peptides to occur in disordered regions of proteins. However, this study focuses on the observation that peptides adopt a well-defined structure upon binding to their partner domain. By analyzing high-resolution 3D structures of protein interactions, the researchers found that the structure of the peptide can be as characteristic as the consensus motif, allowing for the identification of target peptides even if they don't match established patterns. The study reveals that peptides involved in these interactions tend to have a stretched and elongated structure, unlike most other peptides of the same length. To identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions, the researchers developed a strategy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that incorporates structural features of the peptide and other structure-encoded information about binding interfaces. This approach identified 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which were previously unknown, involving over 6,000 interactions in total. The researchers validated their findings by scanning interactome networks from four model organisms and found significant over-representations of these interactions.
Researchers studied 49 adults with environmental enteropathy (EE) in Lusaka, Zambia, to understand the cellular mechanisms behind impaired barrier function and malabsorption. Environmental enteropathy is associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines. The study used confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing to analyze small intestinal biopsies and correlated the results with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a zinc uptake test.

The study found that CLE images showed widespread small intestinal damage, with epithelial defects predominantly at the tips of villi. These defects corresponded with leakage imaged in vivo by CLE. Multivariate analysis revealed that circulating LPS was correlated with cell shedding events and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Zinc uptake from a test dose was attenuated in 64% of individuals and was reduced by HIV, but positively correlated with GLP-2.

Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Confocal endomicroscopy, claudin 4 immunostaining, and histology identified epithelial defects, which are likely sites of bacterial translocation. The study suggests that increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation. GLP-2 and other protective peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE. The study also found a U-shaped relationship between circulating LPS and villus surface area.
Researchers have identified the molecular mechanism behind superinfection exclusion (SIE), a phenomenon where certain viruses block re-infection by the same or similar viruses. In the case of turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a plant virus, SIE is caused by a protein called p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by the virus. When p28 is expressed from a TCV replicon, it blocks the replication of a different TCV replicon. This repressive activity is enhanced when p28 is fused with epitope tags or fluorescent proteins, but weakened when modified at its N-terminus.

The study found that p28 forms large, mobile punctate inclusions in cells that trans-aggregate a non-coalescing, SIE-defective, yet replication-competent p28 mutant. This suggests that p28 forms multimeric complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes, thereby abolishing superinfector replication. The researchers propose a model where TCV SIE is caused by the formation of these multimeric p28 complexes, which could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer a novel target for antiviral therapy. The study also reveals that p28 acts both as a replication facilitator and a repressor, depending on its cellular concentration, and that its repressive activity inversely correlates with its ability to complement the replication of a p28-defective TCV replicon. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SIE and its potential applications in antiviral therapy.
Researchers have developed a genetic vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease, by using a plasmid DNA encoding the parasite's trans-sialidase (TS) gene. The vaccine has been shown to be highly immunogenic and provide protection against acute lethal challenge in mice. However, long-term protection has not been reported. To improve the duration of protection, the researchers tested the co-administration of a plasmid encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) with the TS DNA vaccine. The study found that mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges 6 months post-vaccination compared to those vaccinated with pTS alone. Improved protection correlated with higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells, which were also better able to expand after in vitro re-stimulation. The addition of pIL-15 during genetic vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi. The results suggest that co-administration of pIL-15 with the TS DNA vaccine leads to significant enhancement of long-term protective immunity against this complex intracellular protozoan pathogen. The combination of pIL-15 and pTS induced higher levels of CD4+ Th1 cells and TS-specific IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells, which displayed enhanced proliferative capacity after antigenic restimulation compared to the levels of these responses induced by vaccination with pTS alone.
In the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex called CRL4WDR1 plays a crucial role in controlling the abundance of the Polo-like kinase protein TbPLK. TbPLK is essential for basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. The CRL4WDR1 complex is composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1, and the WD40-repeat protein WDR1. WDR1 interacts with TbPLK through its C-terminal domain and with TbDDB1 through its N-terminal WD40 motif. Depletion of WDR1 leads to the accumulation of TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe, resulting in defective bilobe duplication, basal body segregation, and flagellum attachment. The CRL4WDR1 complex is responsible for degrading TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe after the G1/S cell cycle transition. This process is essential for promoting bilobe duplication, basal body separation, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. WDR1 localizes to the basal body and the bilobe region during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that CRL4WDR1 is primarily responsible for TbPLK degradation in these regions. The study highlights the importance of the CRL4WDR1 complex in regulating TbPLK abundance and its role in maintaining proper cell division and flagellum attachment in Trypanosoma brucei.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the RNA helicase DDX3X in the body's innate immune system, which provides the first line of defense against infections. The study found that mice lacking DDX3X in their hematopoietic system, which is responsible for producing immune cells, were highly susceptible to infection with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. This suggests that DDX3X plays a vital role in the body's ability to fight off certain types of infections.

The researchers discovered that DDX3X deficiency led to changes in the composition of immune cells in the bone marrow and spleen, and impaired the production of cytokines, which are signaling molecules that help coordinate the immune response. The study also found that the impact of DDX3X deficiency varied depending on the sex of the mice, with male mice being less affected than female mice.

DDX3X is a member of a family of RNA helicases that are involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing, and translation. The researchers found that DDX3X regulates the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response, particularly in macrophages, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting off infections. The study suggests that DDX3X may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of DDX3X in the innate immune system and its potential role in modulating the body's response to infections.
A computational model of the insect pheromone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) has been developed. The model focuses on the post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers, the opening and closing of ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model takes into account the translocation of pheromone molecules from the air to the sensillum lymph, their deactivation and interaction with receptors, and the activation of G-protein and effector enzymes.

The model was fitted to experimentally measured receptor potential data at various pheromone doses, capturing the main features of the dose-response curves, including the wide dynamic range and temporal characteristics. The model suggests that two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations: the DAG-gated cationic channel at low concentrations and the Ca2+-gated Cl- channel at middle and high concentrations.

The model also reproduces the second messenger kinetics and provides insights into the regulation of the transduction cascade by modulators, such as protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin, which exert feedback inhibition on the effector and channels. The model proposes several testable predictions and suggests that the ionotropic pathway, which involves the cationic channel OR83b, may play a role in pheromone recognition in insects. Overall, the model provides a comprehensive understanding of the post-effector processes in insect pheromone transduction and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying pheromone recognition in insects.
Researchers investigated how the tumor suppressor protein p53 interacts with DNA sequences and chromatin context to regulate gene expression in response to cellular stress. They analyzed genome-wide binding locations of p53 and a specific histone modification, H3K4me3, in human lymphoblastoid cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. The study found that p53 binding and gene expression were associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell, with most highly inducible p53-regulated genes suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTCF binding.

The researchers discovered that p53 binding was strongly correlated with the similarity of target DNA sequences to the p53 consensus sequence, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility and evolutionary conservation at the p53 binding site. Notably, p53 occupancy was higher at transposable element (TE) repeats, particularly those associated with the MLT1H, LTR10B, and Mer61 TEs. However, binding at these elements was not typically associated with transactivation of adjacent genes.

The study also found that occupied p53 binding sites located in L2-like TEs displayed highly negative PhyloP scores, indicating fast-evolving sequences, and were associated with altered H3K4me3 and DNase I hypersensitivity levels. These results suggest that the interaction between chromatin status and p53 binding site context plays a crucial role in the induced transactivation response, and that this response has been shaped by evolutionary selective pressure, likely driven by transposable elements.
Researchers have reengineered a specific motif found in bacterial two-component signaling systems to create a tunable threshold device. This motif involves a single histidine kinase (HK) that can reversibly phosphorylate two separate output response regulator (RR) proteins. The study found that this system allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a phosphate sink towards the other RR, and implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. This means that the system displays a threshold-like behavior, where the steady-state levels of the phosphorylated output RR remain low until a certain level of signal is reached.

The researchers identified two mathematical conditions necessary for this sigmoidal signal-response relationship and defined key parameters that control the threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. They confirmed these findings experimentally by reconstituting the one HK-two RR motif in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. The study also showed that the level of sigmoidality in the system can be controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK.

This research has implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits. The findings can be applied to any two-component signaling circuit where multiple response regulators compete for phosphorylation by a single phosphodonor. The one HK-two RR motif provides a basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications, enabling the creation of switch-like signal processing in bacteria and yeast.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how individual yeast cells respond to stress. They found that cells within the same population can have different levels of stress tolerance, and that this variation is not fully understood. The study focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, and used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in individual cells with and without salt stress. The results showed that there is significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells was found to decouple the expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response. This decoupling was partly correlated with the cell cycle, but not with the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing fluorescent regulators revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The study suggests that cells have a mechanism to filter out decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation, but can mount a stress response when regulation is coordinated. This research provides new insights into the heterogeneity of the yeast stress response, but many questions remain unanswered. The study's findings could lead to a better understanding of the regulatory networks controlling heterogeneity in transcription and stress tolerance, potentially opening new avenues for controlling population behavior.
Researchers have found that the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in the male reproductive organs of mice. Specifically, the parasite is found in the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of the epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis. This suggests that the parasite is exposed to a strong immune response in the male reproductive organs, contrary to previous assumptions that it might be protected from the immune system.

Histopathological analysis revealed marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. The parasite density in the epididymal adipose tissue and stroma of the epididymis increases over time, reaching up to 105 parasites per milligram of organ at late stages of the disease.

Fine needle aspiration cytology was used to detect parasites in the male reproductive system, and immunohistochemistry with a non-purified anti-pan VSG antibody was used to analyze the presence and distribution of trypanosomes at different stages post-infection. The results suggest that the male reproductive system is an important site for accumulation of trypanosomes, but the testis had virtually no parasites in this study. The findings open the possibility of using fine needle aspiration cytology as a complementary diagnostic tool in Animal African Trypanosomiasis.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to their environment through their sense of smell and taste. They found that the genes responsible for these senses, called chemoreceptors, are highly adaptable and change their expression in response to different conditions. This adaptability is crucial for the flies' survival and is achieved through a complex system of gene regulation.

The study showed that chemoreceptor genes are independently regulated in males and females, at different stages of development, and under various physiological and social conditions. For example, the expression of certain chemoreceptor genes changes when flies are exposed to the odor of the opposite sex or when they have physical contact with members of the same or opposite sex.

The researchers used a technique called cDNA microarrays to analyze the expression of chemoreceptor genes in response to different conditions. They found that the genes can be grouped into small, biologically relevant modules that are highly correlated with each other. This modular organization allows for fine-tuning of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions.

The study provides a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemosensory system in Drosophila melanogaster and sheds light on how this adaptability is achieved at the molecular level. The findings have implications for our understanding of how organisms respond to their environment and how this response is regulated at the genetic level.
Researchers investigated the relationship between meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human oocytes. Studies of human trisomies have shown that abnormal meiotic recombination is linked to nondisjunction at maternal meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events located near or far from the centromere have been associated with human trisomies. To identify these abnormal crossover configurations, the researchers used immunofluorescence to examine meiotic recombination in human fetal oocytes. They analyzed the number and distribution of crossover-associated proteins, such as MLH1, on nondisjunction-prone human chromosomes. The results indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted, but its localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. The study provides evidence for the presence of "vulnerable" crossover configurations in the fetal oocyte, which are consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. The researchers analyzed 1035 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal ovarian samples and found that the recombination patterns observed in linkage analyses of individual trisomies are reflected by the number and chromosomal location of MLH1 foci in pachytene oocytes. However, not all situations were clear-cut, as no evidence was found for "spikes" in the proportion of extremely distal or proximal MLH1 foci on chromosome 21, despite its association with maternal meiosis I and II-derived cases of trisomy 21.
Researchers have found that pre-exposure to the saliva of blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, can alter the progression of vector-borne diseases. These arthropods transmit diseases like Leishmania, Plasmodium, and arboviruses, which pose significant public health and economic burdens. When an arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding. Studies have shown that pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can either exacerbate or limit infection symptoms, depending on the system in question.

To investigate the impact of immune pre-sensitisation on vector control, researchers developed a general model of vector-borne disease. The model suggests that pre-sensitised infected hosts may increase in abundance when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. However, if pre-sensitisation leads to more rapid clearance of infection, increasing vector mortality rates may achieve greater than expected disease control. Conversely, if pre-sensitisation prolongs the duration of infection, vector control can actually increase the total number of infected hosts.

Sensitivity analysis indicates that these negative consequences can be mitigated through integrated vector management. The study highlights the need to quantify how immune pre-sensitisation modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-borne diseases, as the effect of saliva pre-exposure on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis, but largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations.
Researchers investigated how the host immune system affects the expression of proteins in Leishmania amazonensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease affecting 12 million people worldwide. They compared the protein profiles of amastigotes (a stage of the parasite's life cycle) isolated from BALB/c mice, which have a normal immune system, and BALB/c nude mice, which have a weakened immune system. The study aimed to understand how the host immune response influences the parasite's phenotype and virulence.

The researchers used a technique called two-dimensional electrophoresis to separate and identify proteins in the amastigotes. They found 44 proteins that were differentially expressed between the two types of mice, including proteins related to oxidative stress and proteases. Notably, specific isoforms of oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase, known virulence factors of Leishmania, were overexpressed in amastigotes from nude mice. In contrast, an isoform of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was more abundant in amastigotes from BALB/c mice.

These findings suggest that T cells, a type of immune cell, may play a role in regulating the expression of these virulence factors in Leishmania. The study provides new insights into the relationship between the host immune system and the parasite's protein expression, which could lead to the identification of potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression. This knowledge may contribute to the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification and reprogramming CpG methylation in early development. However, AID's high mutagenic potential can lead to genomic instability and chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Researchers have discovered that AID's nuclear stability is regulated by the cell cycle, with degradation occurring more slowly in the G1 phase than in the S or G2-M phase. Mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID's stability and abundance.

By fusing AID to tags derived from cell cycle regulators, the researchers found that enforced nuclear localization of AID in the G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. This suggests that cell cycle regulation determines the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage. The study also identified AID derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, which could be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins through iterative mutagenesis and selection.

Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that AID's subcellular localization, stability, and physiological activity are regulated by the cell cycle. Nuclear degradation of AID occurs more slowly in G1 phase cells than in S-G2/M phase cells, and mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID's stability and abundance. These findings suggest that cell cycle regulation may be generally applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how microbes break down plant biomass, which is essential for understanding environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes. This method combines three techniques: carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. The researchers applied this method to the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans to understand how it ferments various plant biomass components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans.

The study found that the bacterium ferments these polysaccharides with varying efficiencies and prioritizes the metabolism of preferred substrates. The researchers used RNA-seq to reveal how the bacterium responds to different polysaccharides by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. Fifty-six up-regulated CAZymes were purified and their activities showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with different rates, specificities, and cellular localizations.

The researchers then tested the CAZymes in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study advances our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is crucial for developing improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass. The findings also have implications for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities in the environment and the human gut microbiome.
Researchers in Sierra Leone conducted a study to assess the impact of three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas previously treated for onchocerciasis. Between 2008 and 2010, three annual MDAs were conducted in 12 districts where both LF and onchocerciasis were present. The study found that the prevalence of microfilariae (mf) in the blood decreased significantly after the MDAs. The overall mf prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. In four districts, the prevalence dropped to 0.0%, and in seven districts, the reduction ranged from 70.0% to 95.0%. Only one district, Bombali, still had an mf prevalence of 1.58%, which was the highest at baseline. The arithmetic mean mf density also decreased by 65.4% among mf-positive individuals and 96.2% for the entire population examined. The results indicate that three rounds of MDA were effective in reducing LF prevalence to less than 1.0% in all but one of the 12 districts. The study suggests that the integrated approach of managing both onchocerciasis and LF has contributed to the success of the lymphatic filariasis elimination program in Sierra Leone.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have made it possible to study complex microbial communities in various environments, including the human body. However, analyzing these data poses a significant challenge due to the compositional nature of the data, where observed values represent relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances. This can lead to unreliable results, including artifactual correlations among taxa and the appearance of true correlations with opposite signs.

Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, researchers found that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, with many correlations among taxa being artifactual. They also discovered that community diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of these effects. To address this issue, the researchers developed a new approach called SparCC, which can estimate correlation values from compositional data.

SparCC was applied to 16S rRNA gene survey data from the Human Microbiome Project to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. The results showed that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. The SparCC network was used as a reference to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae resists the antimicrobial effects of lysozyme, an enzyme found on mucosal surfaces. Lysozyme has two main activities: breaking down peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls, and acting as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, modify the peptidoglycan of S. pneumoniae, making it resistant to lysozyme. The study found that the muramidase activity of lysozyme, which breaks down peptidoglycan, is responsible for its antimicrobial effect. Both PgdA and Adr modifications are necessary for S. pneumoniae to be fully resistant to lysozyme. Experiments in mice showed that wild-type S. pneumoniae outcompeted a mutant strain lacking both PgdA and Adr in mice with normal lysozyme levels, but not in mice lacking lysozyme. This suggests that resistance to lysozyme's muramidase activity is crucial for colonization of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, single mutations in either PgdA or Adr provided a competitive advantage over wild-type S. pneumoniae in both normal and lysozyme-deficient mice. This indicates that individual peptidoglycan modifications reduce bacterial fitness, but the benefits of resistance to lysozyme's peptidoglycan-degrading activity outweigh this cost. The study highlights the complex effects of peptidoglycan modification on bacterial growth and survival in different environments.
A new approach to diagnosing dengue fatal cases has been developed using NS1 antigen capture tests in tissue specimens. Dengue is the most significant arthropod-borne viral disease in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Brazil accounting for approximately 80% of cases in the Americas. The study aimed to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect dengue virus (DENV) in tissue specimens from 23 previously confirmed dengue fatal cases that occurred in Brazil in 2002. A total of 74 tissue specimens were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes.

The study evaluated three tests for NS1 antigen capture: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip. The results showed that the NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive, detecting DENV in 78.3% of specimens, followed by Platelia NS1 at 60.8%, and Dengue Early ELISA at 34.7%. The NS1 Ag Strip was also the most sensitive in various tissues, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus. The study demonstrates that DENV NS1 capture assays are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool. This is the first study to evaluate ELISA and ICT for detecting DENV antigens in tissues, providing a new approach for diagnosing dengue fatal cases.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) cases from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's CoMMpass study. The study aimed to identify differences in genetic mutations between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) patients. The analysis revealed significant differences in mutation frequencies between the two groups. Three genes, BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2, were found to have higher mutation frequencies in AA cases, which are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases.

The study also found a significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency among patients with higher European admixture in the dataset. The researchers suggest that further investigation of these genes in myeloma model systems could provide insights into their potential role in myelomagenesis, particularly in AA patients. The study highlights the importance of including diverse tumor cohorts in genomic studies to understand the biological mechanisms of myelomagenesis.

This study provides one of the most comprehensive genomic analyses of MM in patients of African descent, shedding light on potential ancestry-related differences in biological mechanisms of myelomagenesis. The findings suggest that a deeper understanding of oncogenic processes driving MM pathogenesis in multi-ethnic cohorts is needed to address disparities in incidence and outcomes observed among AA or otherwise African descent patients.
Researchers have quantified the role of passenger mutations in cancer evolution, which are mutations that do not affect the reproductive rate of cancer cells. These mutations can provide valuable information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock. By analyzing the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions, the study found that the frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced by both the mutation rate and the death-birth ratio of cancer cells. The death-birth ratio, denoted as δ, determines the shape of the cancer's phylogenetic tree, with fast growth resulting in a star-shaped tree and slow growth resulting in a linear tree.

The study also found that the number of subclonal mutations with frequency above 50% is approximately equal to the number of clonal passengers collected during tumor progression when the death-birth ratio is close to 1. This suggests that subtracting the number of subclonal mutations with frequency above 50% from the number of all clonal mutations in the cancer can estimate the number of clonal mutations present in the first malignant cell. The researchers developed a formula that can be fitted to cancer sequencing data to determine how well the branching process model of neutral evolution describes the observed mutation frequencies and to extract the most likely parameters of the process. They applied this formula to the TCGA colorectal cancer dataset and found that the evolution of primary colorectal cancer follows largely neutral evolution, where the founding cell starts a clonal expansion during which cells accumulate neutral mutations.
Researchers studied the misfolding of a protein called huntingtin, which is linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. They used computer simulations to analyze the structure and behavior of the protein's first exon, XN1, with different lengths of glutamine repeats. The study found that the longer the glutamine repeats, the more likely the protein was to misfold into a β-rich state, which is a characteristic of amyloid aggregates associated with the disease. The researchers also discovered that the flanking regions surrounding the glutamine repeats play a crucial role in determining the protein's misfolding behavior. Specifically, they found that the polyproline regions in the flanking regions can prevent the glutamine repeats from misfolding into a β-rich state. Additionally, the study showed that the N-terminal 17 residues of the protein are more likely to adopt a β-sheet conformation rather than an α-helix conformation when the glutamine repeats are longer. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of XN1 aggregation and suggest that the flanking regions may play a critical role in the development of Huntington's disease. The study's results may also have implications for the development of strategies to inhibit XN1 aggregation and potentially treat the disease.
Researchers have explored the diversity of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems in human microbiomes using shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). CRISPR systems are a primary defense mechanism used by eubacteria and archaea to protect against foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and conjugative plasmids. The researchers developed a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRISPR arrays that whole-metagenome assemblies fail to identify. This approach involves recruiting reads from each HMP dataset using the direct repeat consensus sequence of known CRISPR types and assembling the recruited reads into CRISPR loci. The unique spacer sequences can then be extracted for analysis.

The study identified 64 known and 86 novel CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities, with distributions largely being body-site specific. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were found in most oral microbiomes, with samples from the same individual and oral site sharing the most spacers. The researchers also demonstrated the potential applications of CRISPRs in tracing rare species and virus exposure in individuals. The study highlights the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The targeted assembly strategy improved the detection of CRISPR elements in metagenomic datasets, identifying known CRISPRs in more human microbiome datasets compared to whole-metagenome assemblies.
Researchers have identified circadian-regulated transcripts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans using genome-wide expression profiling experiments. These transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods and are sustained under constant conditions, suggesting they are under circadian regulation. The study found that light and temperature cycles drive gene expression and entrain largely non-overlapping gene sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, indicating that environmental cues act cell non-autonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. The findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock. The study also identified conserved clock gene homologs that do not exhibit circadian rhythmicity at the mRNA level, implying that C. elegans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism distinct from that described in other animals. The researchers found that temperature cycles drive the expression of a larger set of genes than light cycles, and genes implicated in metabolism are enriched in the temperature-driven transcript sets. The TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit is required to transduce both light and temperature information to the clock, demonstrating that C. elegans has circadian clocks that are entrained by light and temperature.
Researchers have further investigated the hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype in yeast strains with mutations in the RAD3 gene, which is a homolog of the human XPD gene involved in DNA repair and transcription. The hyper-Rec phenotype is characterized by an increased frequency of mitotic recombination events, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. Using a new system to detect reciprocal products of mitotic recombination, the researchers found that both rad3-101 and rad3-102 mutations elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers by about 100-fold. Mapping of these events revealed that three-quarters of the crossovers result from double sister-chromatid breaks (DSCBs), while the remainder result from single chromatid breaks (SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed in wild-type cells.

The researchers mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. They found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage. A hotspot for deletions and duplications was identified at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. The study suggests that a subset of spontaneous mitotic recombination events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete nucleotide excision repair (NER) reactions, and that DSCBs are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, uses a repetitive DNA element called a T-tract to regulate the expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin (SabA) gene. The T-tract is located near the promoter region of the sabA gene and its length can vary between different strains of H. pylori. Research has shown that the length of the T-tract affects the activity of the sabA promoter, leading to changes in SabA protein expression and binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on the gastric mucosa.

Studies have found that the T-tract length is highly variable in H. pylori strains isolated from different individuals, suggesting that this mechanism allows the bacterium to adapt to the changing host environment. The T-tract length affects the local DNA structure, which in turn influences the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region. This "rheostat-like" mechanism allows for fine-tuning of gene expression, enabling H. pylori to adjust its adhesin expression to match the availability of sialyl-Lewis x receptors in the host.

Further research has identified additional genes in H. pylori with similar T- or A-tracts, which also exhibit rheostat-like regulation. This suggests that this mechanism is a general feature of transcriptional regulation in H. pylori, providing an alternative to classical trans-acting regulatory factors. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori pathogenesis and highlight the importance of the T-tract in regulating gene expression in this bacterium.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) evades the immune system and amplifies its genome in epithelial cells. The study found that the JAK-STAT transcriptional regulator, STAT-5, plays a crucial role in this process. STAT-5 is activated by the HPV protein E7, leading to the activation of the ATM DNA damage pathway. This pathway is essential for the amplification of the HPV genome in differentiating keratinocytes. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation using the drug pimozide abolished viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating cells. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells that stably maintain HPV genomes had no effect on viral replication. The study also identified the STAT-5β isoform as the main contributor to this activity, which is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. Furthermore, the study found that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a downstream target of STAT-5 and contributes to the effects on the ATM pathway. Suppression of PPARγ by HX531 negatively interferes with DNA damage signaling in HPV-positive keratinocytes. These findings highlight the importance of STAT-5 in promoting HPV viral replication through the activation of the ATM DNA damage response. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which HPV evades the immune system and amplifies its genome in epithelial cells.
Researchers identified 13 antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) that are expressed in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid-endemic area. These antigens were detected using an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT). The identified antigens included putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One of the antigens, YncE (STY1479), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, showed a strong response in chronic carriers, but not in healthy individuals or those with acute typhoid fever. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses to YncE were detected in 70% of chronic carriers and 12.5% of individuals with acute typhoid fever. These findings suggest that YncE and other identified antigens may serve as biomarkers for asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage. Further evaluation of these antigens could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers in typhoid-endemic areas. Understanding the host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract of chronic carriers may also facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches for S. Typhi carriage.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called trans-reactivation, where non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a silenced copy of the same gene. This occurs through the presence of homologous RNA molecules produced by the non-functional allele, which can influence the transcriptional state of the silenced gene. The study used the white gene in fruit flies as a model system, where non-functional alleles of white were found to reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the gene that was previously silenced by heterochromatin.

Trans-reactivation was found to be a heritable phenomenon, meaning it can be passed on to subsequent generations, and relies on the presence of diffusible homologous RNAs. Mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing also affected trans-reactivation, suggesting a complex interplay between gene expression and epigenetic regulation. The mechanisms of trans-reactivation differ from previously characterized epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection.

Interestingly, the presence of non-functional white alleles caused an increase in the expression of the wm4h gene and an opening of the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus. This new epigenetic phenomenon provides a previously unknown level of gene expression control, mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and implications of trans-reactivation in gene expression and epigenetic regulation.
Boophilin, a multifunctional Kunitz protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, has been studied for its in vitro mode of action and anti-thrombotic activity. Researchers expressed Boophilin in HEK293 cells and purified it to homogeneity, then used amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments to determine its interaction with thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. The results showed that Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, with a dissociation constant (Ki) of approximately 100 nM. This inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. Additionally, Boophilin was found to inhibit FXIa, preventing FIX activation, and kallikrein activity, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Boophilin also inhibits cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). In vivo, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. These findings suggest that Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, allowing ticks to successfully digest a blood meal critical for metabolism and egg development.
Researchers have developed a computational model called Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) to study the relationship between inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut. The gut mucosa is a complex system where tissue structure and function are closely linked, and inflammation plays a significant role in many gastrointestinal diseases. SEGMEnT is designed to simulate the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture, including the effects of inflammation on morphogenic processes.

The model integrates multiple functional modules, including intra-cellular signaling pathways, cell state transitions, and spatial diffusion of morphogens, to define gut epithelial cell behavior. SEGMEnT can simulate the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture, replicating the behavior of gut epithelial cells as they undergo replication, migration, and differentiation. The model also incorporates the effect of inflammation on these morphogenic processes.

SEGMEnT is a work in progress, representing a minimally sufficient set of components and interactions to achieve a face-valid representation of the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture and its response to inflammation. The model provides insights into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as the role of PTEN/PI3K in the crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, and the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion. These results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a primary vector of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Traditional control methods, including source reduction and insecticide spraying, have shown limited effectiveness in reducing Aedes aegypti populations. The endosymbiont Wolbachia has been proposed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission. Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were released in the community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro, but the frequency of Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes plateaued at around 40% after 20 weeks of releases. This was attributed to the high level of pyrethroid resistance in the local Aedes aegypti population, which was exacerbated by the overuse of insecticides by householders. A new strain, wMelRio, was developed by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles. The wMelRio strain successfully established in the local population, despite reducing egg clutch size and egg hatch. The study highlights the importance of matching the local population genetics, including insecticide resistance background, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The results suggest that Wolbachia deployment should be tailored to the specific insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to be effective. This is particularly relevant given the widespread distribution of pyrethroid-resistant alleles in natural Aedes aegypti populations.
Researchers have investigated the role of the vaccinia B1 protein kinase in poxvirus replication. The B1 protein plays a crucial role in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor BAF, and its deletion leads to a significant reduction in viral fitness. To identify novel pathways involving B1, the researchers used experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus and observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. They found that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provided a striking fitness enhancement to the virus. The B12 pseudokinase was found to primarily localize to the nucleus, a characteristic rarely found among poxviral proteins. Expression of full-length B12 led to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but had no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. This suggests that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. The researchers also found that BAF phosphorylation is reduced under conditions in which B12 is present in infected cells without B1, indicating that B12 may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF. The study presents novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, potentially serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate nuclear events during infection.
Researchers studied the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary amphiphilicity, to understand how they fold and interact with their environment. These peptides are too short to form stable structures on their own and are often disordered in solution. The team used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the peptides' conformational behavior in bulk water and in the presence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces.

In bulk water, the peptides did not form stable alpha-helices, but instead adopted multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. The simulations showed that the peptides' conformational preferences were influenced by environmental conditions such as pH, salts, and the presence of interfaces. When exposed to a macroscopic vacuum/water interface, the peptides adopted a more stable alpha-helical form, with hydrophobic residues partitioning to the interface and hydrophilic residues remaining in the water.

The researchers found that the peptides' aggregation behavior was also affected by the presence or absence of an interface, as well as their surface charge and hydrophobicity. The study suggests that the peptides' conformational behavior is highly dependent on their environment, and that interfaces can play a crucial role in stabilizing specific conformations. The findings provide new insights into the behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides and their interactions with their environment.
Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are common viruses that infect humans in early childhood and remain latent in various cell types. Research has shown that both viruses can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. However, the molecular mechanism of this integration process has remained unclear. Recent studies have identified arrays of telomeric repeats (TMR) in the genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, which are identical to human telomere sequences. To investigate the role of TMR in virus integration, researchers deleted these sequences in the HHV-6A genome and found that they are not essential for virus replication. However, the TMR are crucial for the integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. The perfect TMR (pTMR) plays a major role in this process, while the imperfect TMR (impTMR) makes a minor contribution. The study suggests that the TMR facilitate integration into host telomeres through homologous recombination, allowing the virus to persist in the host for life. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of HHV-6A integration and highlight the importance of TMR in maintaining the virus genome in latently infected cells.
Researchers have made a significant discovery in understanding how poxviruses, a type of enveloped virus, assemble their internal lipid membrane. Unlike most enveloped viruses, poxviruses do not acquire their membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, they generate infectious particles from atypical crescent-shaped precursors. The study focused on the D13 protein, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. The researchers determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of D13 and found that it folds into two jellyrolls decorated by a head domain of a novel fold. D13 assembles into trimers, similar to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. When tethered to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice that resembles the viral crescents and immature particles. This finding supports a model of assembly that shares similarities with the giant mimivirus. The study suggests that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, the D13 protein is a target for the antibiotic rifampicin, and its structure will aid in the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors. The discovery of D13's lipid-remodeling abilities and its role in viral assembly provides new insights into the morphogenesis of poxviruses and has implications for the development of antiviral therapies.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root development in the plant Brachypodium distachyon. They found that a mutation in the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene, which affects tryptophan aminotransferase activity, resulted in elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This was unexpected, as reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity typically leads to reduced root growth in other plants, such as Arabidopsis. The researchers also found that treating wild-type Brachypodium plants with a specific inhibitor of TAA1/TAR enzymes, L-kynerunine, mimicked the Bdtar2lhypo root phenotype, with exaggerated cell elongation. However, the Bdtar2lhypo mutant did not respond to L-kynerunine treatment. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that free auxin levels were elevated rather than reduced in Bdtar2l seminal roots, particularly in the elongating and mature parts of the root. This contrasts with Arabidopsis, where reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity leads to decreased free auxin levels. The study suggests that in Brachypodium, ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner, resulting in sub-optimal auxin levels for root cell elongation. The findings reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.
Researchers have found a link between the organization of promoter nucleosomes and the rate at which genes evolve in species of the budding yeast. They discovered that genes without a nucleosome-free region, known as OPN (Occupied Proximal Nucleosomes), vary widely in expression between species, while genes with a nucleosome-free region, known as DPN (Depleted Proximal Nucleosomes), have largely conserved expression levels. To investigate how early evolutionary dynamics contribute to this difference, the researchers artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins in yeast. They found that selection was equally successful for both OPN and DPN genes, with about 80% of genes in each group increasing in expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted through distinct mechanisms: DPN-selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN-selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes rapidly reverted to their original expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. The study suggests that promoter organization constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution.
The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein, Tax, activates I-κB kinases (IKKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), promoting cell proliferation and transformation. However, in most cells, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, resulting in p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. This study demonstrates that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence acts as a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. The study also shows that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively. Furthermore, down-regulation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delays or prevents the onset of Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection, with robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression driving IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and triggering senescence, while HBZ modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve.
A new computational model of human executive function has been proposed to explain decision-making in everyday environments with uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. The model, called the PROBE model, suggests that the human frontal lobe function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. If no reliable strategy is found, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed from those stored in long-term memory, probed, and if competitive, used to drive action.

The PROBE model reveals that the human executive function has a limited monitoring capacity, which is compensated by a binary structure of executive control that promotes exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies in ambiguous and unknown situations. This model integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. The results support a model of frontal lobe function that creates and manages an expanding repertoire of flexible behavioral strategies for driving action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments.

The PROBE model suggests that the frontal lobes continuously arbitrate between adjusting and staying with the current behavioral strategy, switching to other learned strategies, and creating new ones for driving action. This model provides a new understanding of how the human executive function controls the creation, learning, storage, retrieval, and selection of behavioral strategies, and how it regulates the exploration versus exploitation of behavioral rules and controls creativity in the service of adaptive behavior.
Researchers have developed a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions. This approach uses mathematical modeling to analyze the dynamics of molecular adaptations in response to treatment, allowing for the identification of potential side effects and the design of new target interventions. ADAPT introduces a concept of time-dependent evolution of model parameters, which enables the study of the progression of molecular adaptations over time.

The approach was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to investigate the metabolic adaptations induced by pharmacological activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a potential target for treating or preventing atherosclerosis. The analysis revealed a counter-intuitive insight into the function of scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Despite promoting cholesterol efflux and excretion, LXR activation was found to reduce the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of SR-B1 in hepatic membranes.

The ADAPT approach provides an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression by dynamically linking different experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time. This allows for the identification of molecular events that should be studied in more detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome. The approach can also capture modulating effects caused by interactions with the proteome and transcriptome levels, which are often less well understood.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis to explain how the spinal and cerebellar neuronal circuitry enables the coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. The hypothesis suggests that the combination of sensory and motor signals in the neurons of the spinocerebellar pathways allows for the recombination of signals to approximate various functions, such as spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments. However, the number of granule cells in the cerebellum limits the number of recombinations that can be represented, making random recombination an inefficient strategy. Instead, the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations through linear projections of multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The granule cells, potentially aided by differentiated thresholding from Golgi cells, enhance the utility of these projections by allowing Purkinje cells to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, highlighting the crucial role of the cerebellum in coordinating functions through recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems. The researchers argue that the close correspondence between sensor signals and motor command signals in individual neurons allows the spinocerebellar system to avoid superfluous recombinations and form "good enough" recombinations with high probability.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to study the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Aedes albopictus, a mosquito species that transmits the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and are involved in various cellular processes. The study aimed to investigate how CHIKV infection affects the expression of miRNAs in Aedes albopictus.

The researchers identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected Aedes albopictus cells, respectively. They also discovered nine novel miRNAs in the mosquito cells. By comparing the miRNA profiles of infected and uninfected cells, the researchers found that 77 miRNAs were differentially expressed. Specifically, eight miRNAs were found to be regulated by CHIKV infection.

The researchers used computational biology to predict the targets of these regulated miRNAs and identified their pathways. They found that the regulated miRNAs were involved in various cellular processes, including cell development, proliferation, differentiation, host defense, fat metabolism, and apoptosis. The study provides new insights into the role of miRNAs in CHIKV infection and identifies potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies. The findings suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the development of CHIKV in Aedes albopictus and could be targeted to prevent the spread of the virus.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic infection affecting humans and livestock, has a significant economic impact in many developing countries, including Iran. A recent study aimed to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran by analyzing epidemiological and economic data from 2000 to 2009. The study estimated that the mean number of surgical CE cases per year was 1,295, and the number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was approximately 635,232. The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at $93.39 million, while the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at $132 million. The cost per surgical human case was estimated at $1,539.

The study found that CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, accounting for approximately 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The results suggest that establishing a CE surveillance system and implementing a control program are necessary to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. A cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended to incorporate present knowledge of the economic losses due to CE in Iran. The study highlights the importance of accurate assessment of the disease burden to raise awareness among decision-makers and prioritize the use of limited resources for preventive measures.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) infection in mouse cells, providing new insights into the virus's life cycle and its impact on host cell gene expression. The study used deep sequencing to examine the viral and host transcriptomes at various times after infection, revealing a dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression. The analysis showed that both early-strand and late-strand RNAs are transcribed throughout the infection process, with a switch from early to late gene expression occurring as the infection progresses.

The study identified widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late times in infection, as well as significant changes in host gene expression. A total of 359 host genes were found to be upregulated and 857 downregulated by 36 hours after infection. Gene ontology analysis revealed that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, and RNA processing were upregulated, while those involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, and zinc finger binding were downregulated. The study also found changes in the levels of long noncoding RNAs, including the downregulation of the MALAT1 RNA, which is involved in splicing speckles and is often used as a marker in late-stage cancers.

The findings provide a detailed picture of the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell gene expression, shedding light on the complex interactions between the virus and its host. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying MPyV infection and its potential role in cancer development.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but many experience severe performance limitations due to the depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, a phenomenon known as "hitting the wall." Previous studies have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, implying that "hitting the wall" is inevitable or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon. However, a new computational study reveals that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed.

The study demonstrates that carbohydrate loading prior to marathon running influences performance by allowing runners to run at greater speeds without exhausting glycogen reserves. Typical levels of glycogen loading permit runners to complete a marathon safely in between four and five hours. The study also reveals the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion and the fastest pace at which a given distance, such as the marathon, can be run without exhausting glycogen stores.

The model incorporates the metabolic cost of running and the known dependence of fat versus carbohydrate metabolism on relative exertion. This work provides a basis for guidelines ensuring the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners by setting personally appropriate paces and prescribing midrace fueling requirements to avoid "hitting the wall." The study also sheds light on important standards in marathon running, such as qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.
Researchers studied how different strains of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii interact with host cells, specifically macrophages, in mice. Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis, a disease with variable outcomes in humans. The study focused on non-canonical strains of the parasite, which are not part of the three main clonal lineages found in Europe and North America.

The researchers infected murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA sequencing to analyze the host and parasite transcriptomes. They found significant differences in the expression levels of known parasite effectors and large chromosomal structural variations in some strains. Additionally, they identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains.

The study revealed that IFNβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts. The researchers also found clusters of co-regulated macrophage and parasite genes that are enriched for functional annotation. Overall, the study provides a global insight into host cells and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic Toxoplasma strains, allowing for the identification of novel strain-specific host cell responses and parasite effectors.
Researchers investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows these viruses to acquire new genetic material and adapt to their environment. They used a novel approach to study heterologous recombination in polioviruses, resulting in the isolation of intermediate chimeric viruses with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses led to the emergence of progeny with increased fitness, which had lost the duplicated sequences. The study found that mutations or inhibitors affecting polymerase fidelity or replication complex coalescence altered the yield of recombinants, indicating that recombination is a replicative process.

The researchers propose that recombination in enteroviruses is a biphasic process, consisting of an initial recombination event followed by a resolution phase that deletes extraneous sequences and optimizes viral fitness. This process has implications for our understanding of "evolution by duplication" in positive-strand RNA viruses. The study analyzed a panel of intertypic poliovirus recombinants and found that the majority contained additional sequences within the recombination region, suggesting that these imprecise recombinants may have a growth disadvantage. However, serial passage of these viruses led to the emergence of precise recombinants with enhanced fitness. The findings suggest that it may be possible to enhance or reduce recombination-mediated viral evolution if required. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in enteroviruses and has implications for our understanding of viral evolution and adaptation.
Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) plays a crucial role in the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue (WAT). Unlike previously known routes of NE clearance, such as sympathetic neurons or macrophages, Oct3 is a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. The researchers found that Oct3 is highly expressed in WAT and has the highest uptake rate of NE compared to other known routes. Additionally, adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes, providing the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3.

In mice, ablation of Oct3 resulted in higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to controls. After a prolonged cold challenge, WAT in Oct3-deficient mice showed stronger browning characteristics and elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. This response involved enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. The researchers also found that glycolytic genes were reprogrammed to compensate for the loss of ATP production in Oct3-deficient mice.

Inhibition of β-AR largely abolished the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient WAT, indicating NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes. Reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 were associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). These findings suggest that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.
HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by repressing transcription. These proteins contain two domains: the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD). The CD binds to histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9, a mark associated with transcriptional repression. However, the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, and their binding is facilitated by the opening of chromatin during DNA replication. Researchers investigated whether HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities and found that the CSD interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel. This region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm. The interaction between HP1 proteins and the SWI/SNF complex is antagonistic, with SWI/SNF activity favoring the loading of HP1 proteins onto chromatin. This suggests that HP1 proteins use the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling. In promoters where SWI/SNF functions as a repressor, the opening of chromatin may initiate HP1 stable recruitment, while in promoters where SWI/SNF functions as an activator, HP1 proteins may function as sensors of unwanted SWI/SNF activity, binding to nucleosome domains uncovered by remodeling and blocking the reaction.
Researchers have identified a property of modular RNA structures called self-containment, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to maintain its optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. To measure this property, a scoring method called the self-containment index was developed. The study found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not display high self-containment. Further analysis revealed a trend toward higher self-containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. The study also found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend toward natural selection for self-containment in most functional RNA classes. The researchers suggest that self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. The study's findings have implications for the annotation and design of functional RNAs, and a Python implementation and Web interface to calculate the self-containment index are available online.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens. These TFs, named ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810, were found to be essential for plant resistance to the fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs displayed increased disease susceptibility and a general activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility.

Transcriptome analyses revealed that the mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes, which encode peptides with a secretion signal. These peptides, named PROVIR (provirulence) factors, were found to be important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. Over-expression of many of the PROVIR factors in Arabidopsis conferred increased susceptibility to the necrotroph P. cucumerina, while loss-of-function mutants conferred increased resistance.

The identification of these TFs and PROVIR factors provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the intricate signaling system used by host cells to respond to invasions by pathogenic microorganisms. Further research on these TFs and PROVIR factors may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling fungal diseases in plants.
FOXO1, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in regulating uterine epithelial integrity and progesterone receptor expression, which are essential for successful embryo implantation. In a study using a mouse model, researchers found that ablation of Foxo1 in the uterus led to infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the uterine transcriptome after Foxo1 ablation revealed changes in gene expression related to cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, and the β-catenin signaling pathway, as well as an increase in progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling.

The increase in PGR signaling was attributed to the retention of PGR expression in the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial PGR during this period inhibited FOXO1 expression in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium. This reciprocal expression of PGR and FOXO1 was also observed in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phases.

The study suggests that FOXO1 and PGR are interrelated and critical for embryo implantation. FOXO1 regulates the expression of multiple components of signaling pathways that establish the receptive phase, including activation of cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, and the β-catenin signaling pathway, as well as inhibition of PGR signaling in the murine endometrial epithelium. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of implantation failure in women experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss or unsuccessful in vitro fertilization cycles.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of dengue fever in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reported cases. The model used data from 2000 to 2009 and found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with temperature range were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence rates. The model estimated that 92% of annual dengue cases occurred between August and September, with 94% of cases reported in the capital city of Dhaka. However, less than half of the affected districts reported cases, with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts towards the end of the transmission season.

The study used a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effect model to account for zero-inflation in reported dengue cases. The model identified that increasing mean monthly temperature and decreasing diurnal temperature range at a two-month lag were significantly associated with high dengue incidence. The study's findings provide a valuable assessment of the national dengue situation in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting. The results can inform the prioritization and targeting of dengue control and elimination interventions across the country. However, the study notes that under-reporting was not fully accounted for, and potential causes of geographical variation in dengue transmission, such as climate and socio-demographic factors, were not considered.
Researchers have identified a new type of preferred place in mice that exhibit exploratory behavior in an open field arena. These places, termed "knots," are characterized by high path tortuosity, with mice tracing tortuous paths full of twists and turns within them. Knots are distinct from "home bases," which are typically marked by long visits and high cumulative time spent. Unlike home bases, knots are not characterized by long visits, but rather by sporadic recurrent visits and a higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out. Mice tend to perform knot-scribbling, a behavior that involves tracing a tortuous path, at the point of introduction into the arena, even though they leave these places immediately after being placed there. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal play a role in consolidating a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling. Knot-scribbling may serve as a way for mice to obtain an overview of their environment, allowing them to re-calibrate their locale map and compass directions. The behavior also generates rich vestibular input, which could improve the interpretation of the visual scene. Overall, the discovery of knots and knot-scribbling provides new insights into the complex exploratory behavior of mice in novel environments.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antifungal treatments: the lipid transfer protein Sec14p. This protein is essential for the growth and virulence of certain fungal pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes more deaths worldwide than malaria. A compound called NGx04 was found to selectively inhibit the growth of fungal cells while sparing mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics analysis revealed that NGx04 targets Sec14p, and mutations in the protein's substrate binding pocket reduced the compound's potency. Sec14p is involved in the secretion of virulence factors essential for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans, making it an attractive target for antifungal treatments. NGx04 inhibited the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans, and related compounds showed equal or higher potency against the fungus. Furthermore, NGx04 analogues exhibited fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans strain. The researchers also found that the Sec14p protein is highly conserved across different fungal species, suggesting that targeting this protein could be a viable strategy for developing new antifungal treatments. Overall, the study presents genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and provides initial data supporting its potential as a novel antifungal starting point.
Researchers have identified a potential new treatment for schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, may not be effective in the long term due to the development of drug-resistant parasites. A study has found that mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, shows promising antischistosomal properties in mice. When administered orally, a single dose of mefloquine resulted in high or complete reductions in worm burden in mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum. The study also found that mefloquine was effective against young developing stages of the parasites, which is an advantage over praziquantel.

The researchers tested mefloquine against other antimalarial drugs and found that it was the only one to show significant antischistosomal activity. A single dose of mefloquine resulted in total and female worm burden reductions of 72.3-100% in mice infected with S. mansoni or S. japonicum. The study suggests that mefloquine may be a potential new treatment for schistosomiasis, particularly in areas where malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism of action of mefloquine and to study its effect on other types of schistosomes, such as S. haematobium. The findings of this study hold promise for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality.
Researchers conducted a study to map the geographical distribution of podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, in Cameroon. Podoconiosis was identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study aimed to generate data on the disease's distribution in Cameroon and contribute to the global atlas of podoconiosis. A multi-stage sampling design was used to survey 76 villages from 40 health districts across the country. All individuals aged 15 and older were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoconiosis, excluding filarial-associated lymphedema. Of the 10,178 participants, 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified, but none were found to be positive for Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. Two individuals were found to be positive for Mansonella perstans DNA and Loa loa microfilaria, respectively. After applying the clinical algorithm, 52 people with podoconiosis were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4-0.7). Podoconiosis was found to be widespread in Cameroon, present in nine out of ten regions, with the highest prevalence in eight districts ranging from 1.2% to 2.7%. The study demonstrates the need for a health system response to the burden of podoconiosis through case surveillance and morbidity management services.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the aging process of Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs). They found that Notch signaling increases with age in GSCs, leading to their removal from the stem cell niche. Clonal analysis revealed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, outcompeting their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This increased adhesiveness is mediated by the regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch signaling in GSCs accelerates their age-dependent loss from the niche, while disruption of Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay GSC loss during aging. Notably, Notch activation in the niche, which maintains niche integrity and mediates GSC retention, is reduced with age. This suggests that Notch signaling regulates GSC-niche adhesion both intrinsically and extrinsically. The study reveals a novel role of Notch signaling in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging and has implications for understanding metastatic cancer cells, where Notch signaling suppresses cell adhesion. The findings suggest that Notch signaling needs to be maintained at a relatively low level in young GSCs for their anchorage to the niche.
Researchers have identified a group of kinases, known as conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs), encoded by eight human herpesviruses. These kinases share similarities in their amino acid sequences and genomic positions. The study found that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs possess cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-like activities, including the ability to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A, and disrupt the nuclear lamina. In contrast, the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs lack these Cdk-like activities. The researchers used a yeast complementation assay to directly assess the Cdk function of the CHPKs and found that all beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs, except for one, displayed authentic Cdk activity. The study also found that the non-Cdk-like activities reported for one of the CHPKs, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL97 protein, are poorly conserved among the other family members. The findings suggest that the CHPKs have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections, and that some of these kinases are targets of approved or developmental antiviral drugs. The study highlights the complexity of the CHPKs' functions and the need for further research to understand their roles in viral infections.
A systematic review and consensus guidelines for the environmental sampling of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, have been developed. This bacterium is a Tier 1 Select Agent and is present in the environment in many tropical countries. The global distribution of B. pseudomallei is crucial for developing a risk map for melioidosis, which is essential for preventive measures and raising awareness among healthcare workers in affected areas. However, the current global coverage of environmental sampling is patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur.

The review found that the sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not all were robust. To address this issue, an international working party, the Detection of Environmental Burkholderia pseudomallei Working Party (DEBWorP), was formed to develop consensus guidelines for soil sampling. The proposed guidelines aim to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and "low-tech" methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries.

The guidelines were developed based on a review of 61 environmental studies that reported the detection of B. pseudomallei using culture and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for B. pseudomallei. The review found that 82% of these studies reported the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei. The guidelines provide a basis for developing an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei, which is essential for identifying areas where people are at risk of melioidosis even before cases are recognized.
Researchers have discovered a new way to block the entry of dengue virus into cells by targeting a specific step in the virus's fusion process. The dengue virus uses a protein called E to fuse with the cell membrane, allowing the virus to enter the cell. The E protein undergoes a series of large-scale rearrangements to facilitate this fusion, including a transition from a dimer to a trimer structure. The researchers found that peptides derived from the stem region of the E protein can bind to a conformational intermediate of the E protein, which is a critical step in the fusion process. These peptides specifically block viral fusion and inhibit the virus's ability to infect cells.

The peptides work by binding to the virus before it attaches to the cell, and are carried with the virus into the endosome, where acidification triggers the fusion process. The researchers propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition, where the peptides bind to the virus and prevent it from fusing with the cell membrane. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of dengue virus entry and suggests a potential strategy for inhibiting flavivirus entry. The findings support and extend previously proposed mechanisms for how the E protein conformational change promotes membrane fusion, and could lead to the development of new treatments for dengue and other flavivirus infections.
Researchers have developed a method to directly sequence the whole genome of Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria responsible for cholera, from dried spotted filter paper. This technique allows for the analysis of cholera strains in resource-limited settings, such as remote or conflict-affected areas. The method involves enriching stool specimens in alkaline peptone water and spotting them on filter paper, which can then be used for whole genome sequencing (WGS). The study found that a minimum concentration of 0.02 ng/μL of V. cholerae DNA is sufficient for quality genomic information. WGS confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. The technique also identified co-infecting pathogens and provided rare insight into the specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas. The study demonstrated that the genomic data fit within the current global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying the strains as the 7th pandemic El Tor. WGS results also allowed for the mapping of short reads from alkaline peptone water-enriched specimens and culture isolate spotted filter papers, providing valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. The study highlights the potential of this technique to explore the gut microbiome and identify co-infections that may impact the severity of disease.
Researchers have discovered that the protein Dynein plays a crucial role in regulating epithelial polarity in cells. Epithelial polarity is essential for maintaining the structure and function of epithelial tissues, which form the lining of organs and glands in the body. Dynein is a motor protein that moves along microtubules in the cell and is involved in various cellular processes, including the transport of proteins and organelles.

Studies in Drosophila (fruit fly) follicle cells have shown that Dynein is required for the proper localization of apical proteins, which are essential for maintaining epithelial polarity. The researchers found that Dynein acts through a protein called Stardust (Sdt) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb) to the apical surface of the cell. Crb is a key regulator of epithelial polarity, and its proper localization is essential for maintaining the structure and function of epithelial tissues.

The researchers also discovered that the localization of Sdt mRNA, which encodes the Sdt protein, is regulated by an alternative splicing mechanism. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple proteins with different functions. In this case, the researchers found that the presence or absence of a specific exon (a segment of DNA) in the Sdt gene determines whether the Sdt mRNA is localized to the apical or basolateral surface of the cell.

These findings suggest that Dynein plays a critical role in regulating epithelial polarity and that mRNA localization may have a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal organization. The researchers also propose a unique mechanism by which alternative splicing of a coding exon is used to control mRNA localization during development.
Researchers have found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. This exchange occurs within the sand fly vector, where the parasite undergoes a non-obligate sexual cycle. To study this phenomenon, the researchers created transgenic Leishmania infantum lines that express drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters. They then fed sand flies a mixture of these transgenic lines and observed that the cells with identical genotypes recognized each other and exchanged genetic material. The resulting hybrid progeny were triploid, meaning they had three sets of chromosomes, and were stable throughout the parasite's life cycle.

The hybrid clone was tested in mice and showed reduced parasite loads in the spleen and liver compared to the parental strains. Additionally, the hybrid clone had lower arginase activity, an enzyme involved in the parasite's virulence. The researchers also isolated doubly drug-resistant intraclonal yellow hybrids, confirming the ability of Leishmania to mate within the sand fly vector. These findings suggest that Leishmania can perform recombination between the same genotype during the mating process. The study provides new insights into the reproductive biology of Leishmania and has implications for our understanding of the parasite's life cycle and the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Researchers studied Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or HIV-VL co-infections in Ethiopia. They analyzed DNA from 63 strains using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), cysteine protease B (cpb), and HASPB (k26). The results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290-bp product, while a minority produced a 410-bp amplicon, which was found only in patients with HIV-VL co-infections. In contrast, strains from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450-bp amplicon, with smaller products observed in only three strains. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis distinguished the different PCR products. Sequence analysis revealed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs, with the 13 amino acid peptide motifs being rare in L. infantum. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani vary between geographic regions, indicating considerable polymorphism in the HASPB repeat region among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa. This polymorphism should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model to predict the distribution of HIV-1 recombination breakpoints, which are the boundaries that define the mosaic structure of recombinant HIV-1 genomes. The model, based on local sequence identity, accurately predicts the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV-1 genome. This suggests that a probabilistic model is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations in these regions. However, in certain regions, such as the env gene, the observed frequencies of breakpoints deviate from the predicted distribution, indicating that natural selection is influencing the recombination pattern. The paucity of recombination breakpoints within most of the envelope gene suggests that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. In contrast, breakpoints at a higher frequency than predicted by the model are found at either side of the env gene, indicating increased selection for these recombinants. These findings provide the first clear indication of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination. The study suggests that only a minority of recombination events appear to be significant to the evolution of HIV-1, despite the wide diversity of recombinant forms seen in the viral population. The model can be used to identify regions of the genome where recombination events have a higher probability of being important to viral evolution.
Researchers have traditionally used separate statistical methods to address two interconnected problems in computational modeling for neuroscience research: estimating individual variation in model parameters and comparing candidate models. However, these methods are interdependent, as the relevant population for estimating model parameters depends on which subjects express the model. To address this challenge, a new hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework is proposed, which combines previous approaches to perform concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation, and inference at the population level. This framework has several advantages, including smaller errors in parameter estimation and robust model comparison that is not biased towards overly simplistic models. Additionally, the fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters and quantify corresponding statistical errors. The HBI framework is hierarchical, regularizing individual-level parameters with statistics across all individuals in the group, and Bayesian, representing uncertainties at both individual and group levels with probability distributions. This approach addresses issues of statistical inference over both parameters and models, which have remained elusive with previous hierarchical methods. The results show that the HBI framework outperforms other methods in parameter estimation and model comparison, making it a valuable tool for neuroscience research.
Researchers have identified the role of Hox genes in the development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem. Specifically, they found that the rhombomere r4 contributes to the formation of functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei, and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of these components is crucial for sound perception and depends on the regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 genes. In mice with mutations in Hoxb1 and Hoxb2, the transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is disrupted, leading to hearing impairments. On the other hand, the Hoxa2 gene regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. The study suggests that individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. Furthermore, the researchers found that a single rhombomere, r4, contributes to various derivatives of the auditory pathway, which are distributed across several rhombomeres via selective migrations and structurally linked into functional circuits essential for proper hearing.
Researchers have sequenced the complete genome of the marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40), which is capable of degrading complex polysaccharides. This bacterium is part of a newly discovered group of marine and estuarine bacteria that play a crucial role in recycling complex polysaccharides in the ocean. The genome analysis revealed an unusually large number of enzymes that can break down over 10 different complex polysaccharides. Many of these enzymes have unique structures, including novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules, which are thought to be adaptations that enable the bacterium to efficiently break down complex polysaccharides in the marine environment.

Sde 2-40 is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment. The study found that the bacterium's carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including glucose repression, and that the more complex the polysaccharide, the more enzyme systems are induced. The researchers demonstrated that Sde 2-40 can grow on plants as a sole carbon source and fully degrade them, making it the first marine prokaryote shown to do so. This finding suggests that Sde 2-40 has a significant role in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "super-degrader" and mediating the breakdown of complex polysaccharides from plants, algae, and invertebrates.
Researchers investigated the role of Culex pipiens mosquitoes in the transmission of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) and genotype III (GIII) in China. They found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. This suggests that GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes. The study also showed that both genotypes were detectable in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes at similar transmission rates, indicating the potential of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes for transmission of both genotype viruses. The results suggest that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. The study used a single representative JEV strain from each genotype, and further studies with more different GI and GIII JEV strains are needed to confirm this conclusion.
A two-year review of dengue deaths in Malaysia from 2013 to 2014 was conducted to investigate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease. The study analyzed 322 dengue deaths nationwide, with a mean age of 40.7 years and a majority of cases (72.5%) occurring in adults aged 15-59 years. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. However, 22.4% of cases did not exhibit any warning signs. Only 34% of patients were suspected of having dengue at their initial presentation.

The study found that dengue shock syndrome (DSS) was the leading cause of death, accounting for over 70% of cases, followed by severe organ involvement (69%) and severe bleeding (29.7%). Dengue deaths occurred primarily in adult patients, with DSS being the leading cause of death across all age groups. The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue-related deaths. The review also emphasizes the importance of strengthening the surveillance system to capture dengue-related deaths that occur outside of hospital settings.

The study's findings suggest that dengue is a dynamic disease with an atypical presentation and progression, making it challenging to diagnose and manage. The results of this review provide valuable insights into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of dengue deaths in Malaysia, which can inform public health strategies and improve patient outcomes.
Researchers investigated how insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female attractiveness in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). They found that insulin signaling in specific tissues, such as the fat body and ovarian follicle cells, plays a crucial role in determining female attractiveness. The signals from these tissues are integrated by pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes, which produce cuticular hydrocarbons that serve as attractiveness cues.

The study showed that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells has opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship between the two tissues. Manipulations of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to those caused by global and late follicle cell manipulations. The researchers also found that modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting that it may be involved in nutrient storage.

The study suggests that female attractiveness is linked to an organismal state of high fecundity, which is created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded distinctly to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. The results indicate that insulin-dependent attractiveness cues are determined cell non-autonomously by integration of nutrient-sensing pathway activities from different tissues. The study provides new insights into the mechanistic links between insulin signaling, reproduction, and attractiveness in Drosophila.
Researchers analyzed data from the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to understand how the disease spread at the district level. They used a statistical modeling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people an infected person can transmit the virus to, for each district and country. The results showed significant variation in R0 across districts, ranging from 0.36 to 3.37, and across countries, with estimated R0 values of 0.97, 1.26, and 1.66 for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, respectively. The study found that districts with higher population density and wealth index were associated with higher R0 values, suggesting that rapid urbanization in West Africa may have contributed to the spread of EVD.

The researchers used a mixed effects model to account for the heterogeneity in transmission between and within countries. They estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak and calculated R0 based on predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution. The study's findings support the idea that geographical heterogeneity played a significant role in the transmission of EVD in West Africa. The results also highlight the importance of considering local factors, such as population density and wealth index, in understanding the spread of infectious diseases.
Researchers investigated the factors that influence the rate of protein evolution, focusing on the interplay between a protein's age and its structural properties. They analyzed a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with mapped structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The study found that previously reported relationships between structural properties and evolutionary rates, such as the correlation between solvent accessibility and rate, also hold within each age group. However, the age of a protein modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate, and younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older proteins despite being less designable.

The researchers also introduced a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. They found that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones. The study suggests that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution. The findings support the important role of protein age in shaping evolutionary rates, above and beyond the influence of solvent accessibility and secondary structure.

The researchers ruled out the possibility that structural biases among age groups could explain the reported differences in evolutionary rates with age. By separating secondary structures and solvent accessibility according to age group, they found that younger structures were evolving faster than older ones within each structural category. This implies that differences in the frequency of structural categories by age class cannot explain the previously reported inverse relationship between protein age and evolutionary rate.
Researchers have identified a new component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), called Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3), which plays a crucial role in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). PRC2 is a complex that regulates gene expression by adding a methyl group to histone H3, specifically at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). This modification is essential for various biological processes, including development, ESC differentiation, and cancer.

The study found that Pcl3 interacts with the core components of PRC2, including Suz12, and promotes the binding of PRC2 to specific genomic sites, particularly CpG islands. Pcl3 knockdown in ESCs leads to increased spontaneous differentiation, but does not affect early differentiation decisions. Conversely, overexpressing Pcl3 increases H3K27me3 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 at target genes and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets.

The study also found that Pcl3's Tudor domain, which recognizes methylated histones, is essential for its function. Furthermore, Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind to many of the same targets, particularly CpG islands regulated by Pcl3. These findings suggest that Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that regulates ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and the recruitment of PRC2 to specific genomic sites.
Researchers studied how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans adjusts its chemosensory behavior in response to changes in its feeding state. They focused on a specific chemoreceptor gene, srh-234, which is expressed in the ADL sensory neuron of C. elegans. The team found that the expression of srh-234 is regulated by two types of transcription factors: MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors. MEF-2 and bHLH factors work together to control the expression of srh-234 as a function of the worm's feeding state.

The researchers identified a specific DNA sequence, known as a MEF2 binding site, that is necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234 expression. They also found that another DNA sequence, an E-box motif, is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. Furthermore, the team discovered that bHLH transcription factors, including HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4, act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression.

Interestingly, the researchers found that the expression levels of srh-234 in ADL neurons are also regulated remotely by transcription factors MXL-3 and HLH-30, which act in the intestine. This regulation is dependent on insulin signaling in ADL neurons and involves a subset of insulin-like peptides. These findings suggest that chemoreceptor gene expression is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms, allowing C. elegans to fine-tune its chemosensory responses in response to changes in its feeding state.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in humans in southeastern Australia. Mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from 2004 to 2009, and tested for M. ulcerans using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed BU cases in permanent residents of these towns during the same period was recorded to determine the average cumulative incidence of BU in each location. A strong dose-response relationship was found between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). This suggests that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia. The study's findings have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. The results support the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the spread of M. ulcerans to humans in endemic areas, and public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged. The study's findings also raise questions about the potential role of mosquitoes in the transmission of M. ulcerans in other BU endemic areas, such as Queensland and Africa.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in rats that causes demyelination, a condition characterized by the breakdown of the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS). The mutation, known as dmy, occurs in the Mrs2 gene, which encodes a protein responsible for regulating magnesium (Mg2+) levels in mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells, and Mg2+ is essential for their proper functioning.

Studies have shown that rats with the dmy mutation exhibit severe myelin breakdown in the CNS after normal myelination is completed. The researchers used positional cloning to identify the molecular defect responsible for the demyelinating phenotype and found that a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 gene resulted in a novel splice acceptor site, leading to the functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA validated these findings.

Further analysis revealed that the dmy/dmy rats have significant mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, reduced ATP production, and increased numbers of swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. The researchers also found that MRS2, the protein encoded by the Mrs2 gene, is dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and is localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria.

These findings suggest that the demyelination observed in dmy/dmy rats is likely caused by a mitochondrial disease, and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin. The researchers propose that the dmy/dmy rat could be a useful model for investigating the pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.
Microarray gene expression signatures hold promise for improving disease diagnosis and prognosis, but current documentation standards hinder their application in clinical practice. A study analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and found that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as high as 30% in the worst-case scenario and 18% on average. This discrepancy occurs because documenting a gene expression signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes, and the exact quantitative specification of a classification rule does not define a signature unambiguously.

The study proposes a documentation by value strategy, which documents quantitative preprocessing information, to improve the consistency of diagnoses. By using this approach, the median discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses was reduced to 1%. The study highlights the importance of better documentation of gene expression signatures to facilitate their evaluation and application in clinical practice.

The researchers analyzed eight clinical microarray studies involving different disease types and found that raw microarray data is subject to noise and variation due to measurement error or experimental artifacts. Data preprocessing is a common practice to address this issue. The study emphasizes that the consistency of diagnoses based on gene expression diagnostic signatures depends on the documentation of the signature, and the proposed documentation by value strategy achieves optimal consistency.

The study underscores the need for unambiguous documentation of gene expression signatures to facilitate their communication to other healthcare centers and practitioners for use in clinical routine. The researchers believe that documentation does not receive sufficient attention and propose guidelines and methodology for building and documenting signatures unambiguously to improve the process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice.
Researchers have gained new insights into the structure of curli amyloid fibrils, which are secreted by certain bacteria and play a key role in biofilm formation and bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. The major curli subunit, CsgA, was found to form steric zipper fibrils composed of tightly mated beta-sheets, revealing a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids. This similarity suggests that compounds developed to target Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta may also be effective against curli amyloid formation.

Two D-enantiomeric peptides, originally designed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta, were found to inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Additionally, CsgA fibrils were shown to cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-beta, supporting the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. These findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation and suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms.

The study also highlights the potential for self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source to influence neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids opens up new avenues for the repurposing of anti-amyloid compounds as anti-biofilm agents, which could have significant implications for the treatment of bacterial infections and potentially neurodegenerative diseases. Further investigation into the promiscuity of anti-amyloid therapeutics as antivirulence agents targeting amyloid-structured biofilms is warranted.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a significant cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and long-term neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE is not well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The review identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. Clinical studies reported 257 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013, with JEV as the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age, with 6-7% of cases resulting in death. Surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. The review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance is needed to quantify the burden of JE, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures, including immunization. The evidence suggests that JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, supporting consideration of inclusion of JE vaccine in the national immunization program.
Researchers conducted a large-scale computational study to investigate the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacteria. They analyzed the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across various simulated growth environments. The study found that variations in genetic robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. The researchers decoupled metabolic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent robustness.

Environmental-dependent robustness accounts for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, with specialized species exhibiting higher robustness. In contrast, environmental-independent robustness is linked to a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, such as fast growth rates or extensive production of secondary metabolites. The study found a strong correlation between environmental-independent robustness and intrinsic metabolic capacities, suggesting that the need to increase metabolic capacities has driven the evolution of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks.

The researchers also identified reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. The study's findings support the notion that genetic robustness can arise from a combination of environmental and intrinsic factors, rather than a single origin. The results provide new insights into the evolution of genetic robustness in bacteria and highlight the importance of considering both environmental and intrinsic factors in understanding this complex phenomenon.
Researchers conducted a randomised trial in Uganda to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunisation in pre-school children. The study involved 193 children infected with S. mansoni and 61 uninfected children, aged 3-5 years. The infected children were randomly assigned to receive praziquantel treatment 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunisation. Plasma anti-measles IgG levels were measured at enrolment, 1 week, and 24 weeks after immunisation.

The results showed that S. mansoni-infected children had lower levels of anti-measles IgG and a lower percentage of protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children one week after immunisation. However, among S. mansoni-infected children, those who received praziquantel treatment before or at the time of immunisation had higher levels of anti-measles IgG compared to those who did not receive treatment. At 24 weeks post-immunisation, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who were still S. mansoni stool-positive.

The study suggests that S. mansoni infection is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunisation, and that praziquantel treatment improves the response. The findings imply that effective schistosomiasis control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy in endemic populations.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the evolution of bacterial populations through large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, have limitations when dealing with extensive sampling and high recombination rates. To address this, new statistical tools have been developed to detect and represent recombination between populations and describe the shape of a population in sequence space. These tools are part of the BAPS 5.2 software, which is freely available for download.

The new approach combines population genetic tools with phylogenetic analysis to provide a more comprehensive understanding of bacterial population structures. This is demonstrated using extensive real data from the Neisseria genus, where recombination is known to be frequent. The researchers assumed a simplified evolutionary model of bacterial populations, where each population has a common local ancestor and a global ancestor, enabling a tree representation of evolutionary relationships.

The new statistical tools can analyze large databases with complex patterns of admixture, which was previously not possible with standard Bayesian methods due to computational complexity. The Neisseria species were chosen for validation due to their high recombination rates and occasional horizontal gene flow between species. The results show the potential of combining population genetic tools with phylogenetic analysis to gain a deeper understanding of bacterial population structures. This approach can be applied to other bacterial genera and eukaryotic organisms with complex patterns of admixture.
Researchers investigated the role of top-down beta rhythms in selective attention using a computational model of sensory cortical areas. Beta rhythms, which occur at a frequency of around 20 Hz, have been linked to attentional gain modulation in previous studies. The model simulated the interaction between different layers of the cortex and found that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from layer 5 to layers 4 and 2/3, which are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons in layer 5 were shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner.

The simulation results suggested that top-down beta rhythms can enhance gamma rhythms and spiking activity in layer 2/3, reduce beta rhythms in layer 2/3, and enhance the activity of layer 2/3 regular spiking cells when attention is focused on a specific region of the visual field. The model also found that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic projections from layer 5 cells to upper layers play exclusive roles in modulating activity in superficial layers. These findings provide a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. The study's results are consistent with previous neurophysiological findings and suggest that interlaminar interaction, regulated by top-down beta rhythms, plays a crucial role in selective attention.
Researchers have developed a new method for calibrating and predicting the spread of epidemics using stochastic compartmental models. These models take into account the role of chance events in the early stages of an outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is small. The new method, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), uses a linear noise approximation to describe the fluctuations in the model and updates the estimate of the epidemic state with each new surveillance observation. The researchers tested MSS using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen and found that it produced accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters, such as the mean duration of infectiousness, the basic reproduction number (R0), and the effective reproduction number (Reff). MSS also accurately predicted the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. In comparison to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods, MSS significantly outperformed them in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. The researchers suggest that MSS may improve current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics, which is crucial for public health decision-making during the early stages of an outbreak.
Researchers have discovered that human visual perception is influenced by two opposing forces: sensory adaptation and past decisions. A series of experiments used multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. The results showed that each perceptual report is affected by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, while decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past.

The study found that "continuity fields" arise from the inertia of decisional templates, not from low-level sensory processes. This is consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The researchers propose a unified account of serial dependence, where functionally distinct mechanisms operating at different stages promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The study suggests that there are two contrasting forces that shape our perception at any given moment, biasing the appearance of visual stimuli toward or away from the past. Repulsive forces, resembling low-level adaptation, dominate after stimuli that require no perceptual decision. In contrast, attractive forces, related to decisional inertia, affect current perceptual decisions even when interleaved with new stimuli. The findings support a hierarchical view of serial dependence, where decisional traces combine with or outweigh the impact of previous stimuli.
Researchers have investigated the role of circadian transcription in Drosophila, a fruit fly model organism, to understand its contribution to core circadian timekeeping. The study focused on the Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) heterodimer, a key circadian transcription complex in Drosophila. To enhance the transcriptional activity of CLK-CYC, a viral protein 16 (VP16) was fused with CYC to create a CYC-VP16 fusion protein. The results showed that the CLK-CYC-VP16 complex exhibited significantly increased transcriptional activity compared to the wild-type CLK-CYC complex in both S2 cells and flies expressing CYC-VP16. This enhanced activity was associated with increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes.

The study found that flies expressing CYC-VP16 had a short circadian period, indicating that circadian transcription plays a role in period determination. Further analysis revealed that the short period was due to a more rapid transcriptional phase, which was dependent on the per promoter. The results suggest that the timing of transcriptional activation, rather than the activation itself, is crucial for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. Overall, the study demonstrates that circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function in Drosophila, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian timekeeping.
Researchers have found that the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer new traits in a species can be influenced by the presence of ancestral genes. They studied the pmrD gene, which was acquired by lateral transfer, and its interaction with the PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. The PmrD protein in Salmonella binds to the phosphorylated PmrA protein, protecting it from dephosphorylation by the PmrB protein, leading to the transcription of PmrA-dependent genes, including those conferring polymyxin B resistance. However, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli, despite being able to do so in Salmonella. The researchers found that the E. coli PmrB protein has higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB protein, which affects the levels of PmrA-P and the kinetics of PmrA-dependent gene expression. By replacing the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog, the researchers were able to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. This suggests that quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits, and that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes that play a crucial role in the early stages of cell differentiation. This process, called the Differentiation-Test, analyzes gene expression data from a mixture of differentiating embryonic stem cells without first separating the cells into distinct types. By using biological replicates and a novel statistical approach, the researchers were able to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the early stages of differentiation.

The Differentiation-Test method assumes that the differentiation process starts from a relatively homogeneous initial cell mixture and progresses into a more heterogeneous cell mixture with identifiable events of divergence in gene expression. The researchers applied this method to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies and identified a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal, Smarcad1. They experimentally verified Smarcad1's role in regulating pluripotency and self-renewal using short hairpin RNA.

The Differentiation-Test identified two modules of genes: the differentiation module, which is upregulated during differentiation, and the pluripotency module, which is downregulated during differentiation. The researchers further studied two transcription regulators detected by the Differentiation-Test, Smarcad1 and Pias2, and found that they play a role in regulating pluripotency and self-renewal. The Differentiation-Test provides a principled approach to identify critical regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal, which can be applied to other differentiation processes.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify functional associations between genes that are mutated in the same disease. This method, called the phenotypic-linkage network, uses a combination of data types, including protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks, to examine the relationships between genes. The researchers found that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in the phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. However, they also discovered a confounding bias in coding-sequence length that can lead to false positive findings in functional studies. To address this bias, the researchers developed a tool that controls for coding-sequence length and uses over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations to identify functional associations between genes.

The phenotypic-linkage network was compared to other gene networks, including NETBAG, and found to be more effective in identifying functional associations between genes mutated in the same disease. This method has the potential to improve the interpretation of variants in next-generation sequencing studies, particularly for rare variants that are difficult to associate with disease using case-control studies. The researchers demonstrated the power of the phenotypic-linkage network by functionally subclustering gene variants underlying a polygenic disorder. Overall, the phenotypic-linkage network provides a valuable tool for identifying functional associations between genes and has the potential to advance our understanding of complex diseases.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on nonessential energy-dense foods and a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in January 2014 to combat rising obesity and diabetes rates. This study evaluated the impact of these taxes on packaged food purchases in Mexico's urban population. Researchers analyzed data from 6,248 households that participated in a consumer panel survey from 2012 to 2014. The study found that the volume of purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 grams per capita per month, or 5.1%, in the first year after the tax was implemented, compared to what was expected based on pre-tax trends. In contrast, purchases of untaxed foods did not change. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) households were more responsive to the tax, purchasing 10.2% less taxed food than expected, while middle SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed food than expected. Higher SES households showed no significant change in purchases. The study also found that households did not substitute sugary home-prepared foods or beverages for pre-packaged taxed sweets. The results suggest that the tax on nonessential energy-dense foods and SSBs was effective in reducing purchases of these items, particularly among lower SES households. The study's findings can inform policymakers in Mexico and other countries considering the implementation of food taxes. However, further research is needed to evaluate the impact of the tax on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns.
Researchers developed a biophysically plausible model to explain the response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, specifically the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron (LGMD) of the locust. The model, called "n-ψ," assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. By pooling these channels, the model approximates a power law, which is a common characteristic of brain functions at various levels, from biophysics to psychophysics.

The n-ψ model is based on its predecessor model Ψ, which used an exact power law for re-scaling inhibitory input. However, the n-ψ model is more biophysically plausible and does not rely on an exact power law. Instead, it uses threshold smoothing to approximate a power law in the inhibitory pathway. This process is predicted to occur due to the integration of many inhibitory inputs, or "channels."

The researchers found that the n-ψ model can successfully predict many response characteristics of the LGMD neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a collision course. The model's results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but are relatively robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. This suggests that noise plays a key role in the computations carried out by the LGMD neuron.

The n-ψ model provides a biophysically plausible explanation for the response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, which integrate information across a large part of the visual field. The model's ability to approximate a power law through threshold smoothing offers a new perspective on the underlying mechanisms of brain functions.
Cameroon has made significant progress in controlling Buruli ulcer (BU) since the national control programme (NBUCP) began in 2002. Between 2001 and 2014, 3,700 cases of BU were reported, with the detection rate decreasing from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic health districts increased from two to 64, and five diagnostic and treatment centers are now operational, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education on BU have gained more interest in Cameroon. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities by major support partners has led to a decline in performance indicators since 2010. The NBUCP aims to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all active cases according to standard guidelines, and heal at least 95% of patients without limitation of joint movement. The programme's objectives have evolved over time, with the current goal being to reduce the suffering of the population due to BU and ensure accessibility to quality health services in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and disability. Despite the progress made, the major challenge of resource allocation remains a significant obstacle to further improvement and expansion of the programme.
Researchers investigated how people's confidence in their choices is influenced by the context in which they make those choices. Specifically, they examined whether people are more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains or avoid losses. In two experiments, participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected value of choice options. This bias is domain-general, meaning it applies to both gain and loss contexts, and has important functional consequences. The researchers found that in volatile environments, individuals' learning strategies differ when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. This suggests that profound asymmetries may exist between learning to avoid losses and learning to seek gains, despite apparent similar behavior. The study highlights the importance of investigating confidence judgments and their biases in reinforcement learning, as they can have critical consequences on learning and decision-making processes in different contexts. The findings also suggest that confidence can be used as a meta-cognitive variable to enable dynamic comparisons of different learning strategies and inform decisions about whether to adjust learning strategies.
Alphaviruses, a group of viruses that cause diseases such as chikungunya and dengue fever, have a non-structural protein called nsP3 that plays a crucial role in viral replication. However, the function of nsP3 was not well understood until now. Researchers have discovered that nsP3 interacts with a host cell protein called amphiphysin, which is essential for viral replication. The interaction between nsP3 and amphiphysin is mediated by a specific region on nsP3 called the PIPPPR motif, which is conserved across different alphaviruses. This motif is recognized by the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain of amphiphysin, leading to the recruitment of amphiphysin to the sites of viral RNA replication.

Studies have shown that mutations in the PIPPPR motif of nsP3 disrupt the interaction with amphiphysin, leading to impaired viral RNA replication in cell culture and reduced pathogenicity in infected mice. Furthermore, silencing the expression of amphiphysin-2, a protein that interacts with nsP3, also resulted in impaired viral replication. These findings suggest that the interaction between nsP3 and amphiphysin is essential for alphavirus replication and that targeting this interaction could be a potential strategy for developing antiviral therapies. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of alphavirus replication and highlights the importance of host-virus interactions in the replication cycle of these viruses.
Researchers in Brazil analyzed 123 clinical strains of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, a disease that can lead to disfiguring skin lesions. They used genetic sequencing to identify the types of fungi and found that most of the strains belonged to the family Herpotrichiellaceae, specifically the genus Fonsecaea. Within this genus, Fonsecaea pedrosoi was the most prevalent species, accounting for 80% of the strains, followed by Fonsecaea monophora, Fonsecaea nubica, and Fonsecaea pugnacius.

The researchers also identified two new species of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, one from the genus Rhinocladiella and the other from the genus Cyphellophora. These fungi were found in smaller numbers, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively. The study found that the fungi causing chromoblastomycosis in Brazil are polyphyletic, meaning they do not form a single group, and are dispersed across three different clades.

The researchers note that Fonsecaea pedrosoi is a common cause of chromoblastomycosis in humid tropical climates, including in South America, while Fonsecaea monophora is more commonly found in southern China. The study's findings provide new insights into the diversity of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis and highlight the need for further research into the epidemiology of this disease.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes dampens the host's DNA damage response (DDR) to facilitate infection. The DDR is a critical cellular pathway that detects and repairs DNA damage caused by internal or external factors, including bacterial infections. When Listeria monocytogenes infects a host cell, it induces DNA breaks, but surprisingly, the host's DDR response is only moderately activated. The researchers found that the listerial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a key role in blocking the DDR response by degrading the sensor protein Mre11. This degradation prevents the host cell from fully responding to the DNA damage, allowing the bacteria to replicate more effectively. The study showed that knocking out or inhibiting proteins involved in the DDR leads to increased bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. Furthermore, the researchers found that other bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also induce host DNA damage, suggesting that this may be a common strategy used by pathogens to evade the host's immune response. Overall, the study reveals a new mechanism by which Listeria monocytogenes subverts the host's DDR to promote its own survival and replication.
Researchers have identified a protein called BRD4 as a key player in the replication of two common human viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. These viruses cause a range of diseases, including cold sores and genital herpes. By screening a library of chemicals that regulate gene expression, the researchers found that a compound called JQ1 can enhance the replication of these viruses. JQ1 works by inhibiting the activity of BRD4, which normally helps to regulate the expression of genes in the host cell. When BRD4 is inhibited, the virus is able to replicate more efficiently. The researchers found that JQ1 promotes the formation of a complex between BRD4, a protein called CDK9, and an enzyme called RNAP II, which is involved in gene transcription. This complex is normally involved in regulating the expression of host genes, but when JQ1 is present, it is redirected to the viral genome, allowing the virus to replicate more effectively. The researchers also found that suppressing BRD4 expression or inhibiting the activity of CDK9 can prevent the virus from replicating. This suggests that BRD4 plays a crucial role in the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2, and that JQ1 can be used to enhance viral replication. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of viral infection and may have implications for the development of new treatments for HSV-related diseases.
Researchers conducted a study to understand the microbial ecology of noma, a devastating oral disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children each year. The cause of noma remains unknown, but a combination of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and a weakened immune system is thought to contribute to its development. To investigate the role of bacteria in noma, the researchers analyzed 16S rRNA gene fragments from 60 samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 children with noma, and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG), a related periodontal disease.

The results showed that samples from noma lesions were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted of Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. In contrast, samples from healthy sites in diseased mouths had similar proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. The study also found that the microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was less abundant in healthy sites from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different.

Several bacterial orders, including Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales, were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these orders may be associated with the development of noma lesions. The study's findings provide new insights into the microbial ecology of noma and highlight the need for further research into the role of viral and microbial components in the development of the disease.
Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment. Quorum sensing helps the bacteria decide whether to form spores or engage in necrotrophism, a lifestyle that allows them to survive in the insect cadaver. Researchers have identified a key player in this process, a protein called NprR, which is regulated by a signaling peptide called NprX. In the presence of NprX, NprR acts as a transcriptional activator, regulating genes involved in necrotrophism. However, in the absence of NprX, NprR inhibits sporulation, the process of forming spores, by preventing the phosphorylation of a protein called Spo0F. This inhibition delays the initiation of sporulation. The researchers found that NprR's structure is similar to that of Rap proteins, which also regulate gene expression in Bacillus bacteria. The study suggests that NprR has two functions: it can act as an inhibitor of sporulation and as a transcriptional activator of necrotrophism. The researchers propose that NprX binding to NprR switches its function from an inhibitor to an activator, allowing the bacteria to adapt to their environment. This regulatory mechanism ensures the survival and dissemination of the bacteria during infection. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between quorum sensing, sporulation, and necrotrophism in Bacillus thuringiensis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict the effectiveness of HIV treatment using a combination of genetic and chemical data. Current HIV treatment involves using multiple antiretroviral drugs to control the virus, but each patient's viral genotype is unique, making it challenging to determine the best treatment regimen. To address this issue, the researchers created proteochemometric models that combine genetic and chemical data to predict which drugs will be most effective against a patient's specific viral genotype.

The models were trained on a large dataset of over 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points and achieved a prediction error of less than 0.5 Log Fold Change. When compared to previous models based solely on genetic data, the proteochemometric models performed better in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change. The models were also able to identify previously unknown resistance-conferring mutations in HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease.

The researchers applied the models to a public HIV resistance database and achieved a correct resistance prediction rate of 84%, outperforming previous work on a high-quality subset. The models can be used to predict the activity of clinical antiretroviral drugs on mutants not present in the dataset, making them a valuable tool for clinicians to determine the best treatment regimen for individual patients. The researchers conclude that proteochemometric models can accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data, even for novel mutants and mixtures, and provide an applicability domain to inform users about the reliability of predictions.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis, based on pseudopod autocatalysis, has been developed to explain the complex behavior of eukaryotic cells during chemotaxis. The model proposes that pseudopods are formed through a self-generated cycle, and chemoattractants modulate this cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. The model successfully reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli, selection of accurate pseudopods in the presence of chemoattractant gradients, and bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients, which was experimentally confirmed in Dictyostelium cells. Furthermore, the model predicts that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, which was also experimentally verified. The results suggest that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior, rather than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. The model's simplicity and robustness to parameter changes emphasize that much of the complex behavior of cells may be an emergent property derived from relatively simple pathways, implying a need for a change in experimental approach to understand chemotaxis.
Fleas can transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague, through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species, and previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. One factor that may contribute to these inconsistencies is the type of rodent blood used to infect the fleas. To investigate this, researchers fed fleas bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils and assessed the location and characteristics of the infection in the flea's digestive tract and the flea's ability to transmit Y. pestis. The study found that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood were more likely to experience a phenomenon called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER), where a portion of the infected blood meal is regurgitated into the esophagus. This was not observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER was associated with the accumulation of a dense mixture of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals in the flea's proventriculus. Fleas with PIER were more likely to appear partially blocked during their next feeding, with fresh blood retained in the esophagus. The study suggests that EPT may result from the regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut, and that EPT and BDT can sometimes occur simultaneously. The researchers propose that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin in rat and guinea pig blood may promote regurgitative transmission, which may explain why these rodents are prominent in plague ecology.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can actually improve the accuracy of population codes, rather than hindering them as previously thought. In fact, these correlations can enhance coding performance by astronomical factors, suppressing discrimination errors by many orders of magnitude and increasing the number of stimuli that can be encoded by more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistically high correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few dozen neurons. The researchers also found that heterogeneity in population activity, which is common in the brain, can further benefit from these correlations. The key to this improvement lies in a specific pattern of correlation, which can lead to a "lock-in" of response probabilities that eliminates variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. This pattern can be achieved by tuning one or several effective parameters, resulting in a limit of perfect coding. The study suggests that this phenomenon, referred to as high-fidelity coding, is a general feature of population coding and can be observed in various approaches. The researchers propose experimental tests to identify this pattern and further explore its implications for our understanding of neural coding in the brain.
Researchers have developed a new conjugate vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. The vaccine combines the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (OSP:rTTHc). This conjugate vaccine was tested in mice to assess its ability to induce immune responses and provide protection against cholera.

The study found that mice immunized with the vaccine developed strong anti-OSP and anti-tetanus toxin serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibodies and memory B cell responses. The vaccine also induced intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP when administered intradermally. The researchers tested various vaccine doses, molar ratios of OSP to rTTHc, adjuvants, and immunization routes, and found that intradermal administration of the vaccine induced OSP-specific responses in intestinal tissue.

The vaccine provided 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. The study's findings suggest that the OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine is a promising candidate for preventing cholera, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. The development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high-level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be a significant advancement in cholera control strategies.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the accuracy of immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) for mapping lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with varying levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans endemicity. The researchers collected blood samples from 2,190 individuals in 42 villages across three regions and used ICT to detect circulating filarial antigen and microfilariae (Mf) of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perstans. The study found that ICT positivity was strongly associated with high Loa loa Mf intensity, with 21 individuals having more than 8,000 Loa loa Mf per milliliter of blood. The researchers also observed a strong positive association between the prevalence of Loa loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with an Loa loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, there was no association between ICT positivity and Mansonella perstans prevalence or Mf density. The study suggests that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of Loa loa. The findings indicate that Wuchereria bancrofti may be less prevalent in the Central African region where Loa loa is highly endemic than previously assumed, and accurate re-mapping of the region would be useful for shrinking the map of LF distribution.
Researchers have identified a unique network of modified endoplasmic reticulum in host cells infected with SARS-CoV, a positive-strand RNA virus. This network, known as a reticulovesicular network, is composed of convoluted membranes, double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and "vesicle packets" formed by the merger of DMVs. The convoluted membranes were found to be primarily associated with viral replicase subunits, which are essential for viral RNA synthesis. In contrast, double-stranded RNA, indicative of viral RNA synthesis, was mainly localized to the interior of DMVs.

The study used electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells to visualize the three-dimensional structure of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. The analysis revealed that DMVs are not isolated vesicles, but are instead integrated into the reticulovesicular network. This finding challenges the previous assumption that DMVs are "free floating" vesicles associated with viral RNA synthesis.

The researchers also observed virus budding from the outer membranes of the reticulovesicular network, suggesting a connection between the replication structures and compartments involved in virus assembly. The study provides new insights into the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its interactions with host cells. The ultrastructural description of the reticulovesicular network, combined with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, will aid in further understanding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV replication and the development of antiviral strategies.
A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has provided direct genetic evidence that suberin, a chemical compound found in plant roots, plays a crucial role in controlling water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. The study used a newly characterized mutant, esb1, which has increased root suberin levels, to investigate the effects of suberin on plant water relations and ion transport. The results showed that esb1 mutants had reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their vegetative growth period. Additionally, these changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of certain minerals, such as calcium, manganese, and zinc, and increases in the accumulation of other minerals, such as sodium, sulfur, potassium, arsenic, selenium, and molybdenum, in the shoot.

Grafting experiments confirmed that these phenotypes were the result of elevated root suberin, providing direct evidence that suberin acts as a barrier to the extracellular transport of both water and mineral ions in the root. The study also found that elevated suberin reduced water movement to the shoot and water loss from the root back to the soil, resulting in delayed wilting during water stress. These findings support the standard model that suberin acts as an extracellular transport barrier limiting apoplastic radial transport of water and solutes. The study suggests that increasing root suberin may be a potential approach to developing drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the recovery and reproducibility of rod photoreceptor responses. They used a mathematical model based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, combined with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model was able to reproduce the single photon response (SPR) in both wild-type and mutant mice with varying numbers of phosphorylation sites.

The study found that the randomness of the sojourn times in each phosphorylated state of rhodopsin contributes to the variability of the SPR, while the randomness of the number of rhodopsin turnoff steps has a negligible effect. This result contradicts the prevailing view that the larger the number of decay steps of rhodopsin, the more stable the photoresponse is.

The researchers also found that the diffusion of second messengers acts as a variability suppressor. They used a stochastic framework to analyze the randomness of each phosphorylation state of rhodopsin and interfaced it with the spatio-temporal model to track the diffusion of second messengers and detect the effects of geometrical changes of the rod outer segment on the photoresponse.

The study suggests that rhodopsin shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of second messengers acts to suppress this variability. The results have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the recovery and reproducibility of rod photoreceptor responses.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks within cells. These networks are influenced by factors outside the network, such as fluctuations in ribosome copy numbers. Previous studies have shown that accounting for these extrinsic components is crucial, but the resulting models are often difficult to analyze. The new framework allows for the separation of the network from its dynamic environment by incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. This is achieved by "marginalizing" the system dynamics with respect to the extrinsic fluctuations. The result is a "self-contained" stochastic model that summarizes all possible system behaviors under different environmental conditions. This model can be used for an uncoupled analysis of reaction networks subject to extrinsic noise.

The new framework provides a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated through coupled reaction networks. It also offers a significant reduction in computational effort for Monte Carlo simulations, especially when the environmental network is complex. The model describes the time-evolution of a stochastic reaction network as a continuous-time Markov chain with chemical species and reaction channels. The researchers demonstrate the significance of the approach through several case studies, highlighting its potential as a general tool to split stochastic biochemical networks into individual parts that are easier to simulate.
Researchers have developed a novel closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) training architecture that enables robust control and adaptation using spike events. The architecture, called adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF), incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control model of the brain's behavior in closed-loop BMI control and a point process model of spikes. This allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event at a faster time-scale than current decoders. The OFC model infers the user's motor intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation, a process termed intention estimation, and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model enables dynamic spike-event-based parameter adaptation, unlike current closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA) methods that use batch-based adaptation on slower time-scales. In experiments with a non-human primate, the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention estimation techniques, and OFC-assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared to batch-based methods and was robust to parameter initialization. The architecture also extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training. This novel CLDA framework has significant implications for the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated how the retina processes stimuli with varying degrees of correlation. They presented retinal ganglion cells with natural and artificial stimuli, including movies and white noise checkerboards, and measured the responses of pairs of ganglion cells. The results showed that ganglion cells were more correlated in response to structured stimuli, such as movies, than to unstructured stimuli, such as white noise checkerboards. However, the correlations were not as high as predicted by a non-adapting model of retinal response.

The study found that the retina removes redundancies in correlated stimuli but does not completely decorrelate the output. Instead, the output correlations are reduced to a lower level, similar to those seen in responses to white noise checkerboards. This suggests that the retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a wide range of correlated stimuli.

The researchers also found that the gain of retinal ganglion cells changes with the "effective contrast" of the stimulus, which is the standard deviation of the input to the nonlinearity in a linear-nonlinear model of ganglion cells. This suggests that the retina adjusts its coding strategy to represent the new stimulus class efficiently.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research on the structure of receptive fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex, which differ when probed with natural movies versus random stimuli. The results provide new insights into how the retina processes correlated stimuli and how it adjusts its coding strategy to represent different types of stimuli.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, which occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. The new method, called the Multi-Network and Multi-Classifier (MNMC) framework, improves upon existing approaches by using a large number of features from various data sources to characterize the relationships between pairs of genes. These features are independent of known SL interactions, unlike some previous methods. The MNMC framework uses a non-parametric multi-classifier system to predict SL interactions, enabling the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the new approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art method, particularly for gene pairs not well-connected to known SL interactions. The MNMC framework was used to predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast, resulting in the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, which was partially supported by literature. The approach is expected to be effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms, such as mouse and human, where few genetic interactions have been identified. The researchers made the predicted yeast genetic interactions available for download.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate and interpret genetic variations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk. The BRCA Exchange, a newly created website (www.brcaexchange.org), integrates over 20,000 reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 from public databases, including the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). Approximately 7,250 of these variants have been expertly classified.

The BRCA Challenge has brought together an international team of experts, including clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The project has also established partnerships with national centers to encourage data sharing and has developed methods to extract genetic variation from individual laboratory reports. The BRCA Exchange provides a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype, enabling clinicians and patients to make informed decisions together.

The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally. The project has developed an open-access web portal, the BRCA Exchange, to improve data sharing and variant classification in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, ultimately improving clinical care for clinicians, patients, and their families.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To understand how Plasmodium maintains its redox balance and pathogenicity, researchers have mapped the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins in Plasmodium falciparum. The study found that two peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system are targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid found in Plasmodium. Additionally, the researchers discovered a complete picture of the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins. Notably, Plasmodium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to achieve differential targeting of two major antioxidant redox-enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. This study provides the first comprehensive picture of the subcellular compartmentation of cellular redox metabolism in malaria parasites. The apicoplast, a unique organelle found in Plasmodium, harbors plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty-acid and hem biosynthesis. However, the antioxidative capacity of the apicoplast was previously unknown. The study's findings suggest that targeting the redox equilibrium of Plasmodium could lead to the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. The researchers also demonstrated that ATI exists in apicomplexan parasites and is used to translate protein isoforms with differing subcellular localization from a single gene. This study provides a tool to better understand the cellular functions and interactions of the redox system in malaria parasites.
Researchers studied how a protein called PUMA binds to its partner protein Mcl-1. PUMA is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it doesn't have a fixed shape. When it binds to Mcl-1, a specific part of PUMA called the BH3 motif folds into an alpha helix. The researchers used a computer model to simulate how PUMA and Mcl-1 interact. They found that electrostatic interactions, or the attraction and repulsion between charged particles, play a crucial role in the binding process. Specifically, non-native electrostatic interactions, which occur between parts of the proteins that don't normally interact, help form the initial encounter complex between PUMA and Mcl-1. This complex is the first step in the binding process. The researchers also found that intramolecular electrostatic interactions, which occur within PUMA itself, have a minimal effect on the binding process. The study suggests that electrostatic interactions are important for understanding how intrinsically disordered proteins like PUMA bind to other proteins. This knowledge could be used to make predictions about how mutations in these proteins affect their binding behavior. The researchers used a technique called coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions between PUMA and Mcl-1. They found that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions, which become weaker at higher salt concentrations. The study provides new insights into the binding mechanism of PUMA and Mcl-1, and highlights the importance of electrostatic interactions in this process.
Researchers have studied the behavior of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in silencing key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, the study analyzed the formation and mobility of PcG bodies during fly embryogenesis. PcG bodies are nuclear structures that contain PcG-silenced genes and are thought to be the 3D counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies.

The study found that PcG proteins, specifically PC and Polyhomeotic (PH), progressively accumulate within PcG bodies, which form on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion influencing the displacement of PcG bodies and chromatin domains: long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories, and fast, highly constrained motions within smaller volumes. The fast motion of PcG bodies and chromatin domains decreases in late developmental stages, suggesting a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics to the maintenance of stable gene silencing.

The study also found that the motion of PcG bodies is less sensitive to temperature than chromatin domains in late embryos, suggesting that Polycomb proteins may specifically buffer environmental effects such as temperature change. This buffering may be an important determinant of the stability of Polycomb-dependent gene silencing during development. Overall, the study provides new insights into the behavior of PcG proteins and their role in maintaining gene silencing during development.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the livers of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. They found that mice with a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mutator mice) had 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. These mice also had increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, which resulted in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occurred at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and did not drive the premature aging phenotype.

Sequence analysis showed that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings was inherited from their heterozygous mothers, consistent with germline transmission. The researchers found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. Additionally, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations.

The study suggests that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life. The physiological consequences of linear mtDNA molecules and their contribution to premature aging in mtDNA mutator mice remain unclear and warrant further investigation.
Researchers have discovered a new type of Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane rotor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. This enzyme uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The researchers found that the F1Fo-ATP synthase in F. nucleatum has a novel Na+ recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Activity measurements showed that Na+ stimulates the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis is sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. The researchers also found that Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Two identical crystal structures of the c11 ring were solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing that Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. The structure shows a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers have studied how T cells, a type of immune cell, recognize and respond to foreign substances in the body. T cells use a receptor called the T cell receptor (TCR) to bind to a molecule called the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on the surface of other immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This interaction is crucial for initiating the adaptive immune response against pathogens.

Previous studies have shown that high-affinity binding between TCRs and pMHC molecules can lead to strong T cell activation in laboratory settings. However, a new study has found that this is not the case in the body. The researchers immunized mice with peptides that varied in their ability to bind to TCRs and pMHC molecules, and tracked the response of T cells to these peptides.

Contrary to expectations, the study found that T cells responded best to peptides with intermediate binding characteristics, rather than those with high-affinity binding. In fact, T cells responded poorly to peptides with the highest affinity for TCRs and pMHC molecules. This was due to a decrease in intracellular signaling, expansion, and function of the T cells.

These findings suggest that the way T cells respond to foreign substances in the body is more complex than previously thought. The study highlights the importance of considering how T cells interact with pMHC molecules in the body, rather than just in laboratory settings. This has implications for the design of vaccines, which aim to elicit a strong immune response against pathogens.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Nectria haematococca, a fungus that belongs to the Fusarium solani species complex. This complex includes over 50 species that can cause disease in plants and opportunistic infections in humans. The genome of N. haematococca has 17 chromosomes, ranging in size from 530 kilobases to 6.52 megabases, making it one of the largest genomes among ascomycetes. The physical size of the genome is 54.43 megabases, which is 15% larger than that of its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum.

The researchers found that two classes of genes have contributed to the expansion of the N. haematococca genome. Some genes are unique to this species and are not found in other fungi, while others are present in multiple copies in N. haematococca but as single copies in other fungi. Some of these additional genes may have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

Three of the chromosomes in N. haematococca are supernumerary, meaning they are not present in all isolates of the species. These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to the other chromosomes. The origin of the extra genes and supernumerary chromosomes is not known, but the gene expansion and large genome size are consistent with the species' diverse range of habitats. The presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches.
Researchers have developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to study the egress of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles from infected cells. This method uses total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to visualize fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to track the moment and location of particle exocytosis. The study aimed to elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress.

The results show that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. These vesicles are regulated by Rab GTPases, including Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, which are key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway. The vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is often near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane.

The study found that vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds before membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. The researchers propose an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress. This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress and contradicts previous findings on the distribution of HSV-1 particles on the surface of infected cells.
Researchers investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and host immune response in 109 primary school children. The study found that pinworm infection was associated with increased intestinal bacterial diversity, which peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment were linked to a decrease in Fusobacteria and an increase in Actinobacteria. Specifically, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment.

The study also found that the intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, but was elevated in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. However, a higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole treatment. The results suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria.

The study highlights the complex interaction between pinworm infection, intestinal microbiota, and host immune responses. Further research, including animal studies, is needed to better understand the causal relationships between pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment on gut microbial composition and host immune responses.
Researchers studied the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. They found that most of the genetic variation in root length was not due to individual genes acting alone, but rather to interactions between genes. This is known as epistasis. The researchers used a statistical approach to identify pairs of genes that interacted to affect root length, and found four such pairs involving seven chromosomal loci. These pairs of genes cancelled out the effect of individual genes, making it difficult to detect them using standard genetic analysis methods. The researchers estimated that half of the identified pairs were likely true associations, and further experiments confirmed that four of the associated genes were involved in root development. The study highlights the importance of considering epistasis in genetic analysis, as it can explain why some genetic associations are not detected using standard methods. The findings also suggest that epistasis may be a common feature of complex traits, and that it can be a major contributor to genetic variation. The study's results have implications for understanding the genetics of complex traits and for the development of new methods for identifying genetic associations.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from around the world to understand the relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations. They found that the likelihood of acquiring or retaining a disease-causing mutation is influenced by the mtDNA sequence background. Specifically, certain mtDNA macro-haplogroups were associated with a higher or lower frequency of disease-causing mutations. For example, macro-haplogroup N had a significantly lower frequency of mtDNA sequences with two or more disease-causing mutations compared to what would be expected by chance. This suggests that the mtDNA background may play a role in the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations. The researchers also found that some disease-causing mutations were observed across multiple haplogroup backgrounds, while others were specific to certain clades. This indicates that the relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations is not limited to a few examples, but is a more general phenomenon. The study's findings provide an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups and highlight the importance of considering the mtDNA background in the study of mitochondrial diseases. Overall, the research provides new insights into the complex relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study how cells interact with each other during collective motility, a phenomenon observed in various biological processes such as cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing. The model, which incorporates the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), was used to simulate two-cell collisions on micropatterned substrates. The results showed that a subtle balance between internal cell polarization, CIL, and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome, leading to different possible outcomes such as cells reversing direction, sticking to each other, or walking past each other. The model was able to reproduce all cases seen in two-cell collisions and identified the parameters that control transitions between the different cases, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior and the effect of interventions that modulate collision outcomes. The study highlights the importance of modeling biochemical interactions like CIL and cell contact dynamics to gain a full understanding of cell-cell interactions. The results also show that combining detailed cell shape dynamics with biochemistry can lead to unintuitive behaviors, such as nonmonotonic effects of adhesion. The model can be applied to study collective cell migration in various biological contexts, including the immune system, embryonic development, and cancer invasion.
Researchers have long debated the mechanism by which thioredoxin (Trx) dissociates its mixed disulfide complexes. To shed light on this process, scientists studied the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC). They used a combination of theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants to investigate the dissociation of the Trx mixed disulfide. The results show that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. Cys32Trx is found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC, and it directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx, not on Cys89ArsC. This study provides new insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism, which results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. The findings suggest that Cys32Trx plays a crucial role in the dissociation of the Trx mixed disulfide, and its nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx leads to the release of the reduced substrate and the formation of oxidized Trx. This understanding of the dissociation mechanism has important implications for our understanding of thiol/disulfide exchange reactions and their role in various biological processes.
Researchers investigated how people use social information to determine their preferences, specifically in the context of inter-temporal preferences, or the tendency to value immediate rewards over future ones. They found that people's preferences, or "tastes," are not fixed personality traits, but rather uncertain beliefs that can be influenced by the preferences of others. In a study of over 700 young people, the researchers observed that participants displayed variability in their choices, which was better explained by a model of uncertain taste rather than random decision-making. This suggests that people are uncertain about their own preferences and can learn about them by considering the preferences of others.

The researchers used a Bayesian model to describe how people update their beliefs about their preferences based on social information. They found that the degree of preference change was correlated with the participant's choice variability, indicating that people learn about their preferences through a process of Bayesian updating. The study also found that people's uncertainty about their preferences decreased with age, suggesting that young people are more uncertain about their preferences than older individuals.

The researchers used the paradigmatic case of discounting, or the tendency to value immediate rewards over future ones, to model how learning about someone else's preferences can lead to a change in one's own preferences. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental processes, and suggest that people's preferences are more malleable than previously thought.
Biologists have long sought to understand how different cellular pathways integrate to produce a coordinated response to environmental cues. In budding yeast, filamentous growth is a complex differentiation response that occurs under specific conditions. Researchers used a novel screening approach called secretion profiling to identify regulators of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. This approach measures the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, a signaling mucin that functions at the head of the FG pathway.

The study found that multiple pathways that regulate filamentous growth, including RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG, are also required for FG pathway activation. This regulation sensitizes the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizes it with the global signaling network. Several regulators were found to be necessary for MSB2 expression, which identifies the MSB2 promoter as a target "hub" where multiple signals converge. The histone deacetylase Rpd3p(L) positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth by controlling accessibility to the MSB2 promoter.

The study reveals a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth. The findings suggest that systems-level integration of signaling circuitry coordinates other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors. The researchers identified new regulators of the FG pathway, including components of the RAS pathway and the inositol regulatory transcription factor Opi1p. The discovery that many filamentous growth regulatory pathways impinge on the FG pathway indicates a systems-level coordination between the pathways that regulate filamentous growth.
Researchers studied the evolution of fruiting body morphology in five species of filamentous fungi from the Sordariomycetes group. They grew the fungi in a controlled environment and measured genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. By comparing the gene expression patterns, they reconstructed the ancestral gene expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest increases in expression across development. The team then knocked out these genes in two divergent species and observed altered fruiting body development in the species that had evolved increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than previous studies that targeted whole genomes or gene families. By combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes, the researchers refined Bayesian networks of the genes underlying fruiting body development. This process is one of the least understood aspects of multicellular development. The study found that few developmental genes retain common phenotypes or stages of development, but many retain some function within the larger fruiting body developmental process. The researchers identified key genes relevant to sexual development and their lability in the network regulating fungal sexual reproduction. Estimating gene expression phenotypes in ancestral lineages helped identify putative changes in gene expression that may be key to morphological and adaptive innovation. The study suggests that changes in morphology map to changes in gene regulation and expression, providing insights into the evolution of complex phenotypes.
Researchers have explored the use of square wave electroporation to introduce transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis. The schistosome egg is an attractive target for transgenesis due to its high ratio of germ to somatic cells, allowing for the potential propagation and amplification of transgenes. The study found that square wave electroporation facilitated the introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into the eggs, resulting in higher transduction efficiency compared to soaking alone. Specifically, electroporation enabled the delivery of fluorescent siRNA, messenger RNA encoding firefly luciferase, and pseudotyped retrovirus virions into the eggs. Luciferase activity was detected in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs, indicating successful transduction. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in miracidia compared to soaking alone. The study suggests that square wave electroporation is a valuable tool for introducing transgenes into the schistosome egg, with potential applications for germ line transgenesis and the development of novel control strategies for schistosomiasis. The findings also indicate that germinal cells in the schistosome egg can be targeted by reporter transgenes introduced through electroporation.
Researchers have developed a new approach called the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. This model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation, which is transmitted through the connected network of atoms and residues. The goal is to understand how different parts of the assembly respond to the perturbation, revealing biologically important information.

The PMT model allows researchers to monitor the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously from the moment of perturbation until equilibrium is reached. This approach is particularly effective for large assemblies, requiring relatively small amounts of computational time. The model can also be modified to study signal transmission pathways by applying the initial perturbation to a restricted local region, such as a binding surface.

Using the PMT model, researchers applied it to the GroEL-GroES system, a large macromolecular assembly involved in protein folding. The study characterized functionally important residues and the mechanism of signal transduction in this system. The results showed that the PMT model can identify pivot residues critical for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediation, and anchor residues important for binding interactions. The predictions made by the PMT model had an accuracy of 71-84% when compared to independent experimental studies. This approach is general and can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries, such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.
Researchers investigated the role of fungal galectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding protein, in the defense of fungi against predators. They used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the effects of a mushroom galectin, CGL2, from the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea. The study found that feeding CGL2 to C. elegans inhibited the nematode's development and reproduction, ultimately leading to its death. The researchers discovered that the toxicity of CGL2 depends on its interaction with a specific glycoconjugate on the nematode's N-glycan core. This glycoconjugate, a Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification, was identified through a screen of C. elegans mutants resistant to CGL2. Analysis of N-glycan structures in wild-type and CGL2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and led to the identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope. The researchers also determined the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between CGL2 and the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6GlcNAc trisaccharide, revealing the biophysical basis for this interaction. These findings suggest that fungal galectins play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms.
Researchers have investigated how the presence of a latent reservoir of HIV-infected cells affects the evolution of the virus within an individual and at the population level. A latent reservoir is a group of cells that are infected with HIV but do not actively produce the virus, making it difficult to cure the disease. The study used a mathematical model to simulate the evolution of HIV within a host and found that the presence of a latent reservoir can significantly delay the evolutionary process. This delay can lead to the evolution of intermediate levels of virulence, which are optimal for transmission at the population level.

The researchers also found that the size of the latent reservoir and the rate of cell proliferation within it play a crucial role in determining the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics. If the reservoir is large and cells within it proliferate rapidly, the delay can be substantial, leading to the evolution of intermediate levels of virulence. This can have significant implications for the spread of the virus at the population level.

The study's findings suggest that the latent reservoir has a previously underappreciated role in both within-host and between-host viral evolution. The researchers propose that the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics caused by the presence of a reservoir can explain the lower rates of HIV evolution observed at the epidemiological scale compared to within individuals. This delay can also contribute to the unexpectedly high heritability of HIV set-point viral load despite considerable within-host evolution between transmission events.
Researchers investigated how the virus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) affects the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to it. They used transgenic mice with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that can detect specific viral antigens. The study found that CVB3 almost completely inhibits the presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway. This pathway is crucial for CD8+ T cells to recognize and attack infected cells. As a result, the primary CD8+ T cell response to CVB3 is weak. In contrast, the presentation of viral antigens to CD4+ T cells through the MHC class II pathway is relatively unaffected, and CVB3 induces strong CD4+ T cell responses. These CD4+ T cells display an effector phenotype, mature into memory cells, and can rapidly expand and differentiate into secondary effector cells upon re-infection. The study suggests that CVB3's ability to evade CD8+ T cell immunity is due to its inhibition of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. This finding has implications for understanding the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during CVB3 infection.
Researchers conducted a clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Leprosy Type 1 reactions can cause nerve damage and disability, and corticosteroids are commonly used to treat the condition. However, there is limited data on the optimal dose and duration of treatment. The trial involved 42 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose intravenous MP followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. However, individuals treated with MP were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function compared to those treated with prednisolone alone. Additionally, the study found that 50% of participants required additional prednisolone despite receiving 16 weeks of corticosteroid treatment. The findings suggest that prolonged courses of corticosteroids may be necessary to treat Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. The study also highlights the need to investigate risk factors for the recurrence of Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
Researchers investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in modulating CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. They compared the effects of Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV+) to those from HIV-negative controls (Treg/HIV-). The study found that Treg/HIV+ did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, suggesting a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. However, Treg/HIV+ did inhibit the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall antigens, but not HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, Treg/HIV- inhibited the differentiation of both recall antigen-specific and HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. The study also found that the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on HIV-specific CD8+ T cells compared to recall antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and that this expression did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-. The results suggest that Treg/HIV+ have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses. Overall, the study provides evidence that Treg may exert subset- and clonally-specific inhibitory effects on CD8 T cells in chronic HIV infection.
Researchers investigated the potential of a protein called glutathione-S-transferase (GST) from the lymphatic filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing severe swelling and damage to the lymphatic system. The parasite's ability to survive within the host's lymphatic vessels for years is thought to be due to its ability to counteract the host's immune response through the release of GST.

The researchers cloned the GST gene from W. bancrofti and expressed it in a recombinant form. They then tested the reactivity of serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area and found that those who were not infected with the parasite had high levels of antibodies against the recombinant GST (rWbGST). The researchers also found that these antibodies could inhibit the enzymatic activity of rWbGST.

To evaluate the vaccine potential of rWbGST, the researchers used a mouse model and found that immunization with rWbGST provided approximately 61% protection against a challenge infection with a related parasite, Brugia malayi. The researchers also found that the rWbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST, which is thought to be critical for the parasite's survival in the host. These findings suggest that rWbGST may be a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing in experimental organisms and hold great promise for therapeutic applications. Despite significant advancements in understanding the CRISPR-Cas9 system, concerns remain about potential off-target effects. Recent studies have addressed these concerns by using whole-genome sequencing of gene-edited embryos or animals to identify de novo mutations, which may be caused by poor editing fidelity. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish between generational or colony-related differences and true de novo mutations.

To address this limitation, researchers used a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were genetically modified with well-characterized guide RNAs targeting the coat color Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analysis of the whole-genome data revealed that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing single nucleotide variant (SNV) or insertion/deletion (indel) off-target mutations in treated embryos, the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of de novo mutations occurring due to other processes. This suggests that CRISPR mutagenesis performed under the conditions used in this study is unlikely to cause significant off-target effects. The findings of this study support further development of CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), that play a crucial role in regulating the opening and closing of stomatal pores on plant leaves. Stomatal pores control the exchange of carbon dioxide and water between the plant and its environment, affecting photosynthesis and water use efficiency. Blue light is one of the environmental signals that regulate stomatal aperture, and the researchers found that HRB1 and PP7 are involved in this process.

Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both proteins are expressed in guard cells, the cells that control stomatal opening, in response to light-to-dark or dark-to-light transitions. HRB1 interacts with PP7, and PP7 is necessary for HRB1's stomatal opening response. HRB1 is phosphorylated in the dark and dephosphorylated in the light, and PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1.

The researchers propose that PP7 modifies HRB1 under blue light, allowing it to acquire a proper conformation or bring in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. This study provides new insights into the regulation of stomatal aperture and may lead to strategies for improving plant water use efficiency and crop yields under water-limiting conditions.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. MDT-15 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is essential for RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression. Research has shown that MDT-15 interacts with various transcriptional regulatory factors, including the sterol response element binding protein SBP-1 and the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49, to control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. However, a new study reveals that MDT-15 has a broader range of activities, integrating metabolic responses to various ingested materials, including xenobiotics and heavy metals. The study found that depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene impairs the induction of detoxification genes in response to certain toxins, making the worms more sensitive to toxin exposure. Notably, MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, whereas other stress responses, such as thermotolerance, remain unaffected. The research suggests that MDT-15 integrates several transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, ensuring the maintenance of health and longevity. The study proposes a model in which MDT-15 coordinates the transcriptional response to environmental stressors, including xenobiotics and heavy metals, by employing a different set of regulatory factors. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of MDT-15 in regulating metabolic adaptation to ingested materials in C. elegans.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for spatial navigation, forms mental maps of the environment. Traditionally, it was thought that the hippocampus encodes geometric information such as distances and angles. However, this study suggests that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information. Co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields, and a map encoded by co-firing would be based on connectivity and adjacency, making it a topological map.

Using computer simulations of rat trajectories in different environments, the researchers tested this topological hypothesis. They varied three parameters: firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons, and used a computational algorithm based on Persistent Homology theory to analyze the results. The study found that patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time.

The researchers identified a "learning region" where the interplay between parameters produces hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. Within this region, a lower number of neurons firing can be compensated by adjustments in firing rate or place field size, but beyond a certain point, map formation begins to fail. The study proposes that this learning region provides a theoretical framework for understanding conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity.
Researchers have shed new light on the process by which the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is secreted from infected cells. The current understanding of HCV production involves the assembly of virions on or near lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion were incomplete.

Using a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) analysis and live cell imaging, researchers identified multiple components of the secretory pathway involved in HCV egress. These components include ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles, and adaptor proteins, as well as the recycling endosome. The results support a model in which HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway.

The researchers also developed a live cell imaging approach to study HCV core trafficking using an infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein. This allowed them to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. The results showed that HCV core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and localizes to the Golgi and recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles.

Overall, this study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells, providing a more detailed understanding of the molecular determinants and dynamics of HCV secretion.
Researchers have identified a link between the loss of a specific gene, Grb10, and the development of tumors in mice with a mutation in the Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) gene. NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that helps regulate cell growth, and mutations in this gene are associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The study found that Grb10, an imprinted gene, is often lost in tumors that develop in mice with NF1 mutations. Imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele, and the loss of the expressed allele can lead to a complete loss of protein expression.

The researchers used a mouse model to study the effects of Grb10 loss on tumor development. They found that restoring Grb10 in tumors decreased cell proliferation and downregulated Ras signaling, a key pathway involved in cell growth. Conversely, silencing Grb10 in normal cells increased cell proliferation and activated Ras signaling. The study suggests that Grb10 loss promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which contributes to tumor development.

The researchers also found that Grb10 is a negative regulator of Ras signaling and that its loss contributes to Ras dysregulation in the setting of NF1-mediated tumorigenesis. This study identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis and suggests that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin. The findings have implications for understanding the types of tumors that can arise after Grb10 loss and may have implications for the development of new cancer therapies.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues through Pavlovian fear conditioning, a fundamental skill found in many species. They used a statistical framework to analyze autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses, such as skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PSR), to understand the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning. The study compared different computational models, including non-probabilistic, simple probabilistic, and non-learning models, to determine which one best explains ANS responses.

The results showed that a probabilistic learning model, which assumes a Bayesian agent that represents threat predictions probabilistically, best explains ANS responses. This model suggests that humans use probabilistic inference to form and maintain Pavlovian threat predictions, including estimation of uncertainty. The study found that SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR tracks a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR tracks expected outcome alone.

The findings provide systematic evidence that Pavlovian threat learning in humans relies on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning. The study's use of a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling allowed for precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses. The results have implications for understanding how humans learn to predict threats and could inform the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders.
Researchers have identified a new protein, PomA, in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans that regulates asexual reproduction by affecting the phosphorylation of a protein called HogA. The septation initiation network (SIN) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play crucial roles in fungal cytokinesis and conidiation. PomA acts as a suppressor of the SepH kinase, a key component of the SIN, and its absence or overexpression affects septation and conidiation. Under normal conditions, SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of HogA, while PomA reverses this process. However, under osmotic stress, the phosphorylation of HogA can bypass the requirement of SepH, indicating a crosstalk between the SIN and MAPK pathways. PomA and SepH indirectly regulate HogA phosphorylation by affecting upstream kinases. The study suggests that the phosphorylation of HogA plays a key role in septation and conidiation, and that SepH and PomA coordinately regulate this process. The findings also imply that HogA may be an upstream member of the MobA/SidB protein kinase cascade, which is essential for septation. Overall, the study reveals a complex interplay between the SIN and MAPK pathways in regulating asexual reproduction in A. nidulans.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and the severity of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in patients in Brazil. Tegumentary leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania, which can lead to various clinical manifestations, including cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The study included 156 patients diagnosed with TL, who were tested for LRV1 and the species of Leishmania causing the infection. The results showed that LRV1 was detected in 71.1% of patients with mucosal lesions and 36.7% of patients with cutaneous lesions. The study found a significant association between the presence of LRV1 and the occurrence of mucosal leishmaniasis, with a ratio of 2.93 (95% CI 1.57-5.46, p < 0.001). This suggests that LRV1 may play a role in the development of mucosal leishmaniasis, but it is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The study also identified five different Leishmania species, with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis being the most common. The findings provide new evidence on the relationship between LRV1 and the clinical manifestations of TL, and highlight the complexity of the disease, which is influenced by various factors, including the species of the parasite, the presence of LRV1, and the immune status of the host.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumococcal invasive disease by inhibiting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Researchers found that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection. In contrast, treatment with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)) reduced the development of bacteremia. The study suggests that IFN-I regulates two mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion: platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF receptor)-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration. IFNβ treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the PAF receptor, resulting in reduced pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. The findings indicate that IFN-I is an important component of the host immune defense against pneumococcal infection, limiting the progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.
Researchers have developed a neural network with multiple layers of plastic connections to learn a complex foraging task. The network uses two types of synaptic plasticity: rewarded spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) and non-rewarded STDP. Rewarded STDP is a learning mechanism that strengthens connections between neurons based on the presence of a reward, while non-rewarded STDP strengthens connections based on the timing of neural activity alone.

The network consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer receives sensory information, the hidden layer processes this information, and the output layer makes decisions based on the processed information. The hidden layer uses non-rewarded STDP to learn patterns in the sensory information, while the output layer uses rewarded STDP to make decisions based on the presence or absence of a reward.

The researchers found that the network was able to learn and perform a complex foraging task, involving pattern classification and decision making, without the need for labeled training data. The addition of a hidden layer with non-rewarded STDP allowed the network to identify specific combinations of inputs, while the output layer with rewarded STDP enabled the network to learn to discriminate between rewarding and punishing patterns. Synaptic noise, or random fluctuations in neural activity, allowed the network to learn through trial and error, enabling it to identify effective strategies for solving the task. The study demonstrates that a network with multiple layers of plastic connections, using both rewarded and non-rewarded STDP, is capable of solving complex tasks involving pattern classification and decision making.
The ETS transcription factor ELF5 plays a crucial role in the development and progression of luminal breast cancer. In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, increased levels of ELF5 led to increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, resulting in larger and more numerous lung metastases. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a type of immature neutrophil, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5 and contributed to vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs using specific antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis.

In human luminal A breast cancer, increased ELF5 expression was correlated with increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation, and predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival. Patients with high ELF5 levels experienced unexpectedly early disease progression. In the mouse model, ELF5 drove metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. The study suggests that ELF5 is a defining factor in the acquisition of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer, particularly in the development of anti-estrogen resistance. The findings indicate that ELF5 promotes a tumor-permissive inflammatory environment, characterized by increased intratumoral T lymphocytes and reduced cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These results have implications for understanding the progression of luminal breast cancer and identifying potential therapeutic targets.
Researchers have found that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a significant role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Chromatin loops are characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form. Experiments have shown that these factors influence gene expression, but how they impact cell-to-cell variability remains unclear. To address this issue, a stochastic model was developed to map connection patterns between interacting DNA loops into a multistate model of gene expression.

The model shows that the connection pattern between loops affects gene expression, with nested loops enhancing mRNA expression and reducing expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect compared to side-by-side loops. The study also compared the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression, finding that facilitated tracking performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise. However, this control is distance-dependent, and there is a limit to loop length where the difference in effect between the two communication forms becomes negligible.

The analysis and results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis, suggesting that facilitated tracking is a more effective mechanism for controlling gene expression. The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between chromatin loops in understanding cell-to-cell variability in gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new approach to create riboregulators, which are RNA molecules that can control gene expression without the need for a coexpressed protein. These riboregulators, called translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), can repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. To design these riboregulators from scratch, the researchers analyzed 12 structural and thermodynamic features related to translation initiation modulation. From a library of tiRNAs, 18 riboregulators were selected and tested for their ability to repress gene expression. The results showed that these riboregulators could reduce protein expression levels to as low as 6% of the original levels.

A statistical model was developed to link the properties of tiRNAs to their ability to repress gene expression. This model showed that both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient gene repression by tiRNAs. This approach enables the reliable de novo design of effective riboregulators, which can be used to modulate gene expression in metabolic engineering applications. The use of tiRNAs eliminates the need for coexpressed proteins, reducing metabolic burden and genetic instability.

The researchers propose a framework for the de novo design of tiRNAs, which can be used to develop new riboregulators for various applications. This approach has the potential to expand the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation and improve the efficiency of metabolic engineering.
Researchers have identified a new phenomenon in the brain called coherence potentials, which are large-amplitude local field potentials (LFPs) that occur when the activity of a group of neurons exceeds a certain threshold. These LFPs can spread rapidly across the cortex without distortion, similar to action potentials at the single-cell level, and can extend for hundreds of milliseconds. Unlike action potentials, coherence potentials have a diverse range of waveforms, allowing for high-dimensional encoding of information and the identification of specific associations between neurons.

Studies have shown that coherence potentials can be used to identify functionally associated neuronal groups at different cortical sites during discrete responses to stimuli. The propagation of coherence potentials across cortical regions raises questions about how they interact and how information is transferred between regions. Researchers found that the temporal properties of the LFP waveform often serve as better predictors of behaviors than individual spikes, suggesting that coherence potential propagation represents the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network.

The study used LFP recordings from awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex to investigate coherence potentials. The results suggest that coherence potential propagation preserves the temporal characteristics of the underlying neuronal activity, and that only a small number of units close to the electrode can be resolved, representing a small sampling of the neurons contributing to the aggregate activity. Overall, the discovery of coherence potentials provides new insights into how neurons communicate with each other and how information is processed in the brain.
Researchers conducted a genetic screen in fission yeast to identify essential factors involved in controlling nuclear size. They found 25 genes that, when deleted, altered nuclear size, and implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process. The study revealed a wide range of nuclear size phenotypes, from smaller to larger than normal, and highlighted the importance of global cellular processes and specific nuclear components in controlling nuclear size.

The researchers used fission yeast, a genetically tractable organism, to study nuclear size control. They found that the ratio of nuclear volume to cell volume remained constant across a 35-fold range of cell volumes, suggesting that nuclear size is tightly regulated. In small-scale experiments, they observed that nuclear volume increased steadily with cell volume during the cell cycle, but did not suddenly increase during DNA replication in the S phase.

The study suggests that both the regulation of global cellular processes, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis, and the regulation of specific structural components of the nucleus are important for controlling nuclear size. These findings have implications for understanding how nuclear size is controlled in multicellular organisms, where the nucleocytoplasmic ratio varies between cell types but is generally restricted to a narrow range. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying nuclear size control and highlights the importance of RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). The model uses coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas of the brain that generate pathological oscillations. By analyzing how brain oscillations change when stimulation is applied, the model predicts that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and that stimulation should have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction is based on a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, which has been shown to generalize to other models of neural circuits.

The researchers compared their predictions with data from ET patients and found that they align with the experimental effects of closed-loop DBS. They also proposed a new hybrid strategy that combines two existing closed-loop approaches: phase-locked and adaptive DBS. Phase-locked DBS delivers stimulation according to the instantaneous phase of the oscillations, while adaptive DBS applies high-frequency stimulation when the amplitude of oscillations exceeds a certain threshold.

The model's predictions have been observed in other models of neural circuits, including a biologically realistic model of a neural circuit generating oscillations related to Parkinson's disease. However, this is the first time that the predictions have been directly compared with experimental data from closed-loop DBS. The study's findings have implications for the development of more effective and efficient DBS treatments for neurological disorders.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool to detect Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis, in Biomphalaria glabrata snails. The tool, called Biompha-LAMP, is a rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay that can detect as little as 0.1 femtograms of S. mansoni DNA in 50 minutes at 63°C. This is a significant improvement over existing methods, which can be time-consuming and require specialized equipment.

The Biompha-LAMP assay was tested on snails infected with S. mansoni at different stages of infection, including early prepatent period, light infections, and pooled samples. The results showed that the assay was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails using a simple DNA extraction method.

The Biompha-LAMP assay is specific, sensitive, and rapid, making it a cost-effective method for screening intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. This diagnostic tool has the potential to be used in large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas. The development of Biompha-LAMP is an important step towards the elimination of schistosomiasis, a disease that affects over 230 million people worldwide.
A study in Sri Lanka estimated the costs of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in the public health sector during an epidemic year in the country's most heavily urbanized district, Colombo. The study found that the total cost of dengue control and hospitalizations was approximately US$3.45 million in 2012, with a per capita cost of US$1.50. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of the total costs, making up 79% of the costs of dengue control activities and 46% of hospitalization costs. The average cost per hospitalization ranged from US$216 to US$609 for pediatric cases and US$196 to US$866 for adult cases, depending on disease severity and treatment setting. The study suggests that dengue poses a significant economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka, with a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities, equivalent to a monthly cost of US$0.03 per capita. This analysis is the first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka and highlights the need for country-specific evidence to inform public health priorities and resource allocation. The study's findings indicate that the resources used for dengue prevention and hospital care services are substantial and could be reallocated to other health services.
A recent study has reevaluated the origins of European paternal lineages, specifically focusing on haplogroup R1b1b2 (R-M269), the most common Y-chromosomal lineage in Europe. Contrary to previous research suggesting a Paleolithic origin, the study found that the geographical distribution of R1b1b2's microsatellite diversity is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This suggests that the majority of European Y chromosomes originated in the Neolithic expansion. The study's findings are supported by evidence from other haplogroups, such as E1b1b1 (E-M35) and J, which also show signs of European Neolithic expansion. The research indicates that technological and cultural change is linked to the expansion of Y-chromosomal lineages, making Europe a prime example of this phenomenon. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA diversity presents a different picture, with no east-west cline and most lineages having a Paleolithic time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). The study's results imply that males played a unique role in the transition to the Neolithic period in Europe. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of European population history and the relationship between technological and cultural change and the expansion of Y-chromosomal lineages.
A recent study investigated the relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning. Contrary to previous suggestions, the research found that movement variability does not consistently increase the speed of motor learning. In fact, the study's computational modeling and experimental data suggest that increased variability can sometimes slow down learning. A meta-analysis of published papers also revealed no statistical relationship between movement variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. The study's findings do not rule out the possibility of a positive correlation between motor variability and learning rate, but rather suggest that this relationship may be task-specific and dependent on the factors affecting task performance. The research highlights the complexity of motor learning and the need for further investigation into the relative importance of various factors involved.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between RelA, a key component of the NF-κB protein complex, and its co-activators CBP and p300. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell survival, and proliferation. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex consists of two components: the DNA-binding domain of RelA interacting with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of RelA binding to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event at a specific site on RelA is necessary for the first interaction to occur. The researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the RelA:CBP complex, revealing how RelA's TAD folds upon binding to TAZ1. They also designed mutants of RelA that selectively disrupted the two components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis, the researchers found that a larger set of RelA-activated genes is affected by this interaction than previously believed. They also showed that the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through a negative feedback loop. Additionally, chromatin analysis revealed that CBP/p300 is constitutively recruited to RelA target gene promoters, suggesting a role in recruiting RelA to its target sites.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA) to analyze gene expression data collected over time. This method is an extension of traditional gene set analysis, which considers predefined groups of genes, to longitudinal data. TcGSA uses random effects modeling to account for missing data and allows for the analysis of all available measurements. The method is designed to identify gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity within gene sets.

TcGSA has been applied to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the HIV trial, TcGSA revealed significant changes in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets, whereas other methods failed to detect any significant patterns. In the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine study, TcGSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine, which were previously associated with the pneumococcal vaccine.

A simulation study demonstrated the good statistical performance of TcGSA, showing increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is made available to the research community through an R package. TcGSA offers a solution for the full exploitation of repeated measurements of gene expression data based on gene set analysis, allowing for the detection of subtle changes while controlling false discovery.
Researchers have created the first comprehensive map of the global endemicity of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite that has been understudied compared to Plasmodium falciparum. The map is based on 9,970 geopositioned parasite rate surveys collected from 1985 to 2010 and uses a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity in every 5x5 km grid square. The model incorporates data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa.

The map shows that the Americas contribute 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas are generally sparsely populated and account for only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk globally. In Africa, stable transmission is constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of global people at risk. Central Asia is home to 82% of global people at risk, with high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contains areas of high endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, contributing 9% of global people at risk.

The map is intended to contribute to a shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination. The researchers used a robust and flexible modeling framework to generate continuous surfaces of malaria endemicity based on retrospectively assembled parasite rate survey data.
Clumping factor B (ClfB) is a cell wall-anchored protein expressed by Staphylococcus aureus that plays a significant role in the bacterium's ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Previous research has shown that ClfB facilitates S. aureus nasal colonization by binding to host ligands such as loricrin and cytokeratin 10 in the anterior nares. However, the role of ClfB in SSTIs had not been investigated until now. This study reveals that ClfB is crucial in determining the structure and bacterial burden of skin abscesses early in infection, and that this is dependent on its interaction with loricrin, a protein expressed within the abscess tissue. The study found that targeting ClfB with a model vaccine that induced both humoral and cellular responses led to protection against S. aureus skin infection. This suggests that ClfB is an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines. The study's findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of S. aureus SSTIs and identify ClfB as a promising candidate for inclusion in next-generation vaccines targeting this type of infection.
Researchers have developed a hybrid stochastic framework to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV. The framework integrates pharmacological, viral, and host factors to evaluate the effectiveness of different PrEP regimens. As an example, the researchers applied the framework to dolutegravir (DTG), a second-generation integrase inhibitor. They predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 nM and 722.23 nM of DTG would prevent 50% and 90% of sexual transmissions, respectively. The researchers also simulated the use of DTG in PrEP, PrEP "on demand," and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before and after virus exposure. The results showed that once-daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% of infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP "on demand" prevented 79-84% of infections, and PEP prevented more than 80% of infections when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. The simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada, the current PrEP medication. The framework can be adapted to other PrEP candidates, and the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide the release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy, a cellular process that enhances its replication. However, the mechanisms by which HCV regulates autophagy are not well understood. Researchers have found that HCV infection induces the expression of two proteins, Rubicon and UVRAG, which play opposing roles in the maturation of autophagosomes. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, leading to their accumulation in the early stages of infection, while UVRAG stimulates their maturation. The induction of Rubicon is rapid, while the induction of UVRAG is delayed, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early stages of infection. The researchers used siRNA knockdown and over-expression experiments to confirm the role of Rubicon in inhibiting the maturation of autophagosomes and enhancing HCV replication. In contrast, the over-expression of UVRAG facilitated the maturation of autophagosomes and suppressed HCV replication. The HCV subgenomic RNA replicon, which expresses only nonstructural proteins, was also found to induce the expression of Rubicon and the accumulation of autophagosomes. The study suggests that HCV differentially regulates the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to temporally regulate the autophagic flux and enhance its replication. The results indicate that Rubicon plays a positive role in HCV replication by increasing the pool of autophagosomes, while UVRAG suppresses HCV replication by facilitating the maturation of autophagosomes.
Cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, plays a crucial role in regulating spermatogenesis in mice. Unlike its homologue, Cyclin Y (CCNY), CCNYL1 is specifically expressed at high levels in the testis and is essential for male fertility. Mice lacking CCNYL1 (Ccnyl1-/-) are infertile, while mice lacking CCNY (Ccny-/-) have normal fertility. Spermatozoa from Ccnyl1-/- mice display impaired motility and structural defects, suggesting that CCNYL1 is indispensable for male fertility.

The interaction between CCNYL1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) is critical for spermatogenesis. CCNYL1 and CDK16 form a protein complex that increases the stability and kinase activity of CDK16. Phosphorylation of CDK16 by CCNYL1 is essential for their interaction and modulation of CDK16 activity. The CCNYL1:CDK16 complex is localized to the plasma membrane of spermatogenic cells, where it maintains enzymatic activity.

The absence of CCNYL1 leads to impaired fertilization, likely due to the structural defects and impaired motility of spermatozoa. The CCNYL1:CDK16 complex is a potential target for the development of male contraceptives or drugs that specifically inhibit CCNYL1 expression or CCNYL1/CDK16 activity.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) hemolysin (EHEC-Hly) is a virulence factor that contributes to the pathogenesis of EHEC-mediated diseases, including diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome. EHEC-Hly exists in two forms: free and associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by EHEC during growth. While the free toxin is lytic towards human endothelium, the effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, the primary targets during EHEC infection, were unknown. Researchers investigated the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. They found that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse these cells but triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized by the cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked to endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly escapes from the lysosomes and targets mitochondria, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptotic cell death. This study reveals a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases, where OMV-mediated intracellular delivery allows the toxin to target mitochondria and induce apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells.
Research in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has revealed a complex relationship between two proteins, P-TEFb/Cdk9 and histone H2B ubiquitylation, in regulating transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). P-TEFb/Cdk9 and histone H2B ubiquitylation, specifically H2Bub1, interact in a bidirectional manner, with each influencing the activity of the other. Lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing its phosphorylation of the transcription processivity factor Spt5 reduces H2Bub1 levels, while mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. Genome-wide analyses show that Cdk9 and H2Bub1 have opposing effects on the distribution of transcribing RNAPII. This suggests that Cdk9 and H2Bub1 have antagonistic functions that must be kept in balance to regulate elongation. Loss of H2Bub1 disrupts this balance, leading to deranged gene expression and aberrant cell morphologies. The study also reveals a novel function of a conserved, co-transcriptional histone modification in regulating elongation. Furthermore, the research suggests that other pathways can modulate the functions of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 in transcript elongation, and that P-TEFb activity is required to overcome repressive effects of histone modifications.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant public health concern in South America and Africa, causing severe morbidity and mortality. To understand the evolutionary history of YFV, researchers conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 133 viral isolates from 22 countries over 76 years. The study found that the currently circulating strains of YFV originated in Africa approximately 1,500 years ago and were introduced to the Americas through the slave trade around 300-400 years ago. The virus then spread westward across the continent and persists in the jungles of South America.

The analysis revealed two distinct geographic groups of YFV, with separate lineages in Africa and the Americas. Despite frequent outbreaks in West Africa, there was no significant difference in evolutionary dynamics between viruses in South America and Africa. The virus established a sylvatic enzootic cycle in the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins, vectored by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. The introduction of YFV to the Americas is supported by gene sequence data and modern phylogenetic techniques, providing evidence for the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease. This study demonstrates the power of gene sequence data in testing hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, shedding light on the complex history of YFV.
Researchers studied the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. The study aimed to identify vulnerable points in the multiple steps involved in pneumococcal pathogenesis by analyzing population bottlenecks, which are sharp reductions in the size of the population due to environmental constraints. The researchers found that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. The study also found that IAV increases the burden of colonizing pneumococci, consistent with prior observations in infant mice. The researchers used an infant mouse model that recapitulates many of the key features of pneumococcal pathogenesis, including localized and systemic disease and host-to-host transmission. The study's findings demonstrate how viral infection and the innate immune responses it stimulates drive bacterial contagion.
Researchers have identified two recombinant proteins from the saliva of Phlebotomus orientalis, a sand fly species that transmits Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. The proteins, mYEL1 and mAG5, were found to be effective in detecting antibodies against P. orientalis in human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. These proteins were produced using bacterial and mammalian expression systems and tested for their ability to detect anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera using ELISA and immunoblotting. The combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 showed a high correlation coefficient and improved specificity compared to using the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The study found that 52% of sera samples from Sudan and 34.5% from Ethiopia tested positive for anti-P. orientalis antibodies, indicating a significant exposure to sand fly bites in these regions. The use of mYEL1 and mAG5 as antigens has the potential to simplify studies aimed at detecting antibodies in people bitten by P. orientalis in visceral leishmaniasis endemic areas.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is mobilized by IncA and IncC plasmids (A/C plasmids) through a process triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD. Although SGI1 is not self-transmissible, it carries genes traNS, traHS, and traGS, which are homologs of the mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC encoded by A/C plasmids. Researchers investigated the regulation of traNS and traHGS and their role in SGI1 transmissibility. They found that expression of these genes is inducible by AcaCD and that TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins that can replace TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids. Complementation assays showed that TraGS and TraHS are required for optimal SGI1 transfer and that remodeling of the IncC-encoded mating pore by SGI1 enhances transfer rates. Furthermore, TraGS was found to be crucial for DNA transfer between cells bearing IncC helper plasmids, suggesting that SGI1 disables an IncC-encoded entry exclusion mechanism. These findings indicate that SGI1 remodels the mating apparatus of IncC conjugative plasmids to promote its own self-propagation.
Researchers investigated the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 in the DNA damage checkpoint, a process that allows cells to adapt to persistent or irreparable DNA damage. The study found that Cdc5 promotes adaptation to DNA damage by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53. Hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 is a key step in the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell-cycle arrest. However, when Cdc5 is overproduced, Rad53 hyperphosphorylation is significantly reduced, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage and re-enter the cell-division cycle.

The researchers found that Cdc5 overproduction had little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation, including the localization of checkpoint sensors and the phosphorylation of Rad9 by Mec1. However, the interaction between phosphorylated Rad9 and Rad53 remained intact. The study suggests that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through the loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage. This mechanism is likely conserved in higher eukaryotes, as polo kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of adaptation to DNA damage and highlights the importance of Cdc5 in regulating the DNA damage checkpoint.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, known as the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. This framework is designed to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales, which is crucial for understanding pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression. The KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, allowing it to circumvent charge-relaxation processes and run simulations on millimeter and second scales on a standard desktop computer.

The 3-D KNP framework is an improvement over previous models, which were limited to small spatiotemporal scales or simplified 1-dimensional transport processes. The new framework can predict how ion concentrations vary in all spatial directions surrounding neuronal sources, making it applicable to a broader range of biological problems. The researchers used the KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell, demonstrating the efficiency of the framework.

The KNP framework can handle 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at relatively large spatiotemporal scales without requiring excessive computer power. This makes it a valuable tool for exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS. The framework can be used in conjunction with other simulation tools, such as the NEURON simulator, to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the ECS.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vector-borne diseases program could leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. Researchers evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment, using a mathematical model to simulate scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The study found that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The analysis showed that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the costs needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without considering the cost in human lives and well-being. The study's findings provide a science-based justification for re-assessing the proposed budget cut and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance. The research highlights the vulnerability of developed countries to mosquito-borne pathogens and the importance of adequate funding for vector-borne disease research and surveillance to enable early detection and rapid interruption of transmission.
Researchers conducted a study in western Nicaragua to investigate the prevalence of dengue fever among children and adults presenting with acute febrile illness. A total of 740 patients, aged 1 year and older, were enrolled in the study and provided paired sera samples for testing. The results showed that 63.5% of the patients were seropositive for dengue at enrollment, with the seroprevalence increasing with age, reaching over 90% in individuals over 20 years old. Acute dengue was identified in 5.1% of the patients, with serotypes 1 and 2 being the most common. Notably, only 8.1% of the confirmed cases were suspected clinically, indicating that dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in the region. The study also found that dengue was the only flavivirus circulating in humans in Nicaragua during the study period, reducing the likelihood of serologic cross-reactions with other flaviviruses. The median age of patients with acute dengue was 16 years, and they presented with clinical features similar to those with other acute febrile illnesses. The study highlights the need for increased awareness and surveillance of dengue fever in the region, particularly given the risk of Zika virus transmission by the same vector and the potential for severe congenital infections.
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant damage to crops, resulting in billions of dollars in losses annually. Effective plant defense against pathogens relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, the role of PTI in plant-nematode interactions is not well understood. Researchers have identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) in Arabidopsis, termed NILR1, which is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. NILR1 is specifically regulated upon nematode infection and is dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. Loss-of-function mutants of NILR1 are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes, highlighting the importance of NILR1 in plant defense against nematodes. NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor involved in the induction of basal immunity (PTI) in plants or animals in response to nematodes. The discovery of NILR1 provides new options for nematode control in crop plants and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions.
Researchers have investigated the effects of miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, on Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis. The study found that treating adult S. mansoni worms with miltefosine in a laboratory setting increased the exposure of worm surface antigens, making them more recognizable to the immune system. This was demonstrated using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, which showed strong fluorescence of the S. mansoni adult worm surface after treatment with miltefosine. The study also identified four specific proteins on the surface of the worms that were exposed by miltefosine treatment: fructose-1,6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. Antibodies against these proteins were found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula, the larval stage of the parasite, and induce immune agglutination, suggesting a potential role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent, where the drug unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. The findings suggest that antigens involved in this molecular mechanism could have potential as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may enhance the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.
Bacillus cereus, a human opportunistic pathogen, has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources, including heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. Ferritin, a 24-mer nanocage protein, stores thousands of iron atoms within its cavity, but the molecular basis of iron acquisition from ferritin has been poorly understood. Researchers have identified a surface protein named IlsA, which binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface and enhancing iron release from ferritin. Isothermal titration calorimetry data show that IlsA binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell subunits. The siderophore bacillibactin plays a crucial role in iron uptake, as disruption of its production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus is proposed, involving the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This study highlights a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore and provides new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis. Further research is needed to determine whether the ability of IlsA to bind ferritin is a universally conserved feature of pathogenic bacteria.
A new mathematical model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been developed. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP. The model proposes that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformational state. Phosphorylation of the CII domain serves as a timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor and how the differential affinity of KaiA for different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. The model predicts that as the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, the release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which stabilizes this state and leads to the sequestration of KaiA, resulting in KaiC dephosphorylation. The model was tested using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm and was able to describe a wealth of experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a unique ability to evade the host's innate immune response, leading to persistent infection. Despite the activation of the RIG-I-MAVS axis by HBV's pre-genomic RNA, the mechanism behind the suppression of interferon-αβ (IFN-β) synthesis remains unclear. Researchers have discovered that HBV induces the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria through parkin, a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. This recruitment disrupts the MAVS signalosome and attenuates IRF3 activation, ultimately leading to the suppression of IFN-β synthesis.

Parkin interacts with MAVS and accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, preventing its interaction with downstream TRAFs and IRF3 activation. This novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling highlights the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. The study also shows that silencing parkin restores IFN-β synthesis in HBV-expressing cells upon stimulation with a RIG-I agonist. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for HBV-induced suppression of innate immunity and suggest that mitochondrial dynamics play a crucial role in antiviral signaling during HBV infection.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen associated with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The superantigen, called pfiT, is encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, a type of bacteria found in the gut. PfiT is a T-cell superantigen, which means it can stimulate a strong immune response by binding to the T-cell receptor on immune cells.

The researchers determined the three-dimensional structure of pfiT at a resolution of 1.7 angstroms, allowing them to understand how it interacts with human immune cells. They found that pfiT binds to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of immune cells, specifically to HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. This binding stimulates the proliferation of human lymphocytes, indicating that pfiT can activate the immune system.

The researchers also found that pfiT competes with another superantigen, Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM), for binding to HLA-DR, suggesting that their binding sites overlap. Additionally, they discovered that pfiT belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators, which is a distinct structural family of superantigens.

These findings suggest that pfiT is a new family of T-cell superantigens and may play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The researchers propose that the interaction between pfiT and the immune system may contribute to the development of the disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of pfiT in Crohn's disease and its potential as a therapeutic target.
Researchers have found that the gene Nanog plays a crucial role in determining the heterogeneity of embryonic stem cell populations. Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency, which is the ability of stem cells to develop into any cell type in the body. Studies have shown that Nanog expression is not uniform in stem cell populations, but rather exhibits a disperse distribution. This heterogeneity is thought to be influenced by the allelic control of Nanog expression, which refers to the different versions of the Nanog gene that are present in each cell.

Using a mathematical model, researchers were able to simulate the effects of allelic control on Nanog expression and found that it leads to a bimodal distribution of Nanog levels in stem cell populations. This means that some cells have high levels of Nanog, while others have low levels. The researchers also found that the dynamics of Nanog expression are state-dependent, meaning that the rate at which Nanog is turned on or off depends on the current state of the cell.

The study suggests that allelic regulation of Nanog expression is a key factor in maintaining the heterogeneity of stem cell populations. This heterogeneity is thought to be important for the maintenance of pluripotency and the ability of stem cells to self-renew. The findings of this study have implications for the use of stem cell lines in research and therapy, and highlight the importance of considering allelic regulation in the study of stem cell biology.
Researchers have quantified the amount of unused protein in Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, across 16 different environments. They found that nearly half of the proteome, or the complete set of proteins produced by an organism, is unused in certain environments. This unused protein incurs a quantifiable fitness cost on cellular growth rates, but the magnitude and variability of unused protein expression in natural settings was previously unknown.

Using a combination of absolute and global proteomics data and a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli, the researchers were able to determine the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. They found that accounting for the cost of unused protein expression explains more than 95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across the 16 distinct environments.

The researchers also discovered that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. They classified the unused protein and found that it encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. This suggests that unused protein expression may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.

The study provides a baseline understanding of the percentage of the microbial proteome that is un-utilized in a given environment and how much the un-utilized protein fraction can vary across environments. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution and regulation of proteome expression in microbes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in three major ethnic populations in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians. The study analyzed data from over 6,000 individuals, including 2,010 cases and 3,945 controls, to identify genetic variants associated with T2D. The results showed that variants at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci were strongly associated with T2D in all three ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings in European populations. However, the study also found evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity, suggesting that the genetic architecture of T2D may differ between populations. Additionally, the study detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations, which may contribute to the failure to detect associations across diverse ethnic groups. The findings highlight the importance of conducting GWAS in diverse populations to fine-map causal variants and identify population-specific genetic factors contributing to T2D. A meta-analysis of the three studies revealed strong associations at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, with effect sizes similar or larger than those reported in European studies. The study demonstrates the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups to better understand the genetic etiology of T2D.
In the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, nuclear division occurs in the daughter cell during mitosis. Research has shown that the evolutionarily conserved Aurora B kinase Ipl1 plays a crucial role in this process. Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and is essential for the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope. This allows Ipl1 to enter the nucleus and regulate the structural integrity of microtubules, which are critical for kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Without Ipl1, the stability of cytoplasmic microtubules is compromised, leading to a delay in kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. An in silico model previously proposed that cytoplasmic microtubules and cortical dyneins promote atypical nuclear division in C. neoformans. However, a revised model suggests that an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic Bim1 and dynein regulates the dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Live cell imaging and in silico modeling indicate that Ipl1 spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity, along with microtubule stability, to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. The study proposes that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry, which is essential for the spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans.
Researchers investigated a case of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with a somatic RET p.Cys634Arg mutation, a known driver of the disease. The patient also had a germ-line RET substitution, p.Cys630=, which was initially considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the RET mutations were in cis, meaning they occurred on the same chromosome. Expression analysis showed that the RET transcript was increased in the patient with the p.Cys630=;p.Cys634Arg mutation compared to seven other MTCs with the p.Cys634Arg mutation alone. Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the synonymous RET mutation was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p.Cys630= variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. This study documents a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. The findings suggest that the p.Cys630= substitution enhanced the oncogenic effect of the p.Cys634Arg mutation by increasing constitutive splicing efficiency.
Researchers have developed a new bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complexity genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This is crucial for accurate diagnosis of human infections using metagenomic sequencing, a method that captures all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. Contamination in reference genomes can lead to false identification of pathogens, hindering diagnosis. The new system identifies and removes human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complexity genomic sequences, from a comprehensive database of sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. This results in a "clean" database of eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools.

The system was tested on a large set of eukaryotic pathogen genomes, yielding a cleaned and filtered database ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics. The new database provides better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives compared to using the original genomes. The method can be applied to both complete and draft reference genomes and has the potential to improve the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis of human infections.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, in Uganda. They analyzed 269 isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya between 1959 and 2011. The isolates were genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense.

The results showed that the isolates can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters. Clusters 1 and 3 contain isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. The analysis also revealed genetic admixture among the three clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly ongoing gene flow between them.

The study found that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense. It also confirmed the emergence of human-infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains of different genetic backgrounds and the importance of cattle as a reservoir for T. b. rhodesiense. The results have implications for the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region and highlight the need for continued monitoring and control efforts.
Researchers investigated the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in the inflammatory response during endotoxic shock. They found that mice lacking TXNIP (Txnip−/−) were more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. This increased susceptibility was due to excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Txnip−/− macrophages. An inhibitor of iNOS rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, indicating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock.

The study also showed that Txnip−/− mice had reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This suggests that TXNIP regulates NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The researchers propose that TXNIP interacts with the NF-κB/iNOS pathway to regulate disease states associated with sepsis. They also found that excessive NO production in Txnip−/− mice inhibits NLRP3-dependent IL-1 secretion via direct S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Overall, the study demonstrates that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The findings suggest that TXNIP plays a critical role as a negative modulator of NO and iNOS expression during LPS-induced endotoxic shock.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZTF-8 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in repairing DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability in the germline. The germline is the cell lineage that produces gametes, or reproductive cells, and mutations in DNA repair genes in this lineage can contribute to tumor progression. ZTF-8 is conserved across species, from worms to humans, and is involved in repairing both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the germline. Mitotic DSBs occur during cell division, while meiotic DSBs occur during the production of gametes. ZTF-8 is also required for the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, a mechanism that prevents cell division when DNA damage is detected. In ztf-8 mutants, researchers observed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, mitotic nuclear arrest, and accumulation of recombination intermediates, indicating impaired DNA repair. ZTF-8 interacts with the 9-1-1 complex, a protein complex involved in DNA damage response, and with MRT-2, a component of this complex. The human homolog of ZTF-8, RHINO, rescues the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, suggesting functional conservation across species. The study suggests that ZTF-8 promotes repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability in the germline.
Researchers used single cell transcriptomics to study how motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate in the neural tube. They found that the transcription factor Olig2 plays a crucial role in this process. Olig2 represses the expression of Hes1 and Hes5, two effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, just before MN differentiation. This repression is direct, as Olig2 binds to a specific regulatory element within the Hes5 locus, preventing its expression in MN progenitors.

The study revealed a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation. By modulating the Notch pathway, Olig2 not only specifies MN identity but also determines the rate at which these progenitors differentiate. The researchers found that Notch signaling controls the transition between the distinct phases of Olig2 expression by restraining Olig2 expression in MN progenitors.

Inhibiting Notch signaling up-regulates Olig2, suggesting that Notch signaling normally restrains Olig2 expression. The study also showed that distinct Olig2 expression dynamics underlie the progression of pMN cells to MNs and p3 progenitors. The researchers propose that Olig2 inserts itself into the Notch-regulated neural differentiation program, shutting down Notch activity and ensuring MN development proceeds in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanism of motor neuron differentiation and the role of Olig2 in this process.
Researchers used a nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm). They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to "prime" their cellular immunity. Four months later, the animals were challenged with H1N1pdm. The results showed that the "primed" animals had a stronger and more rapid cellular immune response to H1N1pdm compared to naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and peaked earlier in the "primed" animals. Furthermore, the "primed" animals cleared the H1N1pdm infection significantly earlier from the upper and lower respiratory tract than the naive animals, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates. The findings have implications for the development of vaccines that can induce such cross-reactive T cells to protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method to quickly and accurately detect Q fever, a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The new method, called Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), is a simple and sensitive test that can detect the presence of C. burnetii in human and animal samples. The LAMP assay targets the htpAB gene of C. burnetii and can detect as few as one copy of the gene per reaction.

The LAMP assay was compared to real-time PCR, a more complex and expensive method, and found to be equally sensitive and specific. The study also tested the LAMP assay on 24 human blood samples and 126 animal samples, including goats, cattle, horses, marmots, and deer. The results showed that the LAMP assay was able to detect C. burnetii in 33.3% of human samples and 7.9% of animal samples, compared to 8.3% of human samples and 0.8% of animal samples detected by real-time PCR.

The LAMP assay is a potential tool for diagnosing Q fever in humans and animals, particularly in rural areas of China where access to sophisticated equipment and complicated protocols may be limited. The test is rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective, making it a valuable addition to the diagnostic toolkit for Q fever. Further evaluation of the LAMP assay and investigation of the epidemiology of Q fever among domestic animals is recommended, particularly using genital tract specimens from animals to obtain a more accurate rate of C. burnetii infection.
Researchers have discovered a new class of regulatory elements called embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers (ESSEs) that play a crucial role in the expression of genes in cancer. These enhancers are normally active in embryonic stem cells but are silenced in differentiated cells. However, in cancer, ESSEs are often reactivated, leading to the expression of genes that are typically associated with embryonic development.

The study found that ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes in cancer, with methylated ESSEs associated with silenced genes and unmethylated ESSEs associated with reactivated genes. This is in contrast to other types of enhancers that do not show this trend. The researchers also identified a specific ESSE downstream of the VEGFA gene, which is involved in blood vessel formation, and found that its methylation state affects VEGFA transcript levels in cancer.

The study suggests that ESSEs provide a framework for the reactivation of embryonic genes in cancer. The findings are consistent with previous research showing that DNA methylation levels are closely linked to enhancer activity states and expression levels of associated cancer genes. The study's results also support the idea that ES-specific accessible chromatin elements are targeted for epigenetic reprogramming during cancer development.

Overall, the discovery of ESSEs and their role in cancer gene expression provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cancer development and may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.
Researchers investigated how dividing a population into smaller groups, or demes, affects the time it takes for the population to overcome obstacles in its genetic makeup, known as fitness valleys or plateaus. These obstacles can hinder the population's ability to adapt and evolve. The study focused on a simple model where demes are connected by migration, allowing individuals to move between groups. The researchers found that subdividing a population can significantly speed up the process of crossing fitness valleys or plateaus, but only if the demes are in a state called the "sequential fixation regime." This means that the demes must be small enough that genetic changes occur one by one, rather than all at once. The study used mathematical equations and computer simulations to determine the conditions under which subdivision accelerates the crossing of fitness valleys or plateaus. The results showed that subdivision can speed up the process for a wide range of parameters, even beyond the optimal conditions. The researchers also found that the degree of subdivision affects the magnitude of the speedup and the range of parameters over which it occurs. The study's findings have implications for understanding how populations adapt and evolve in natural systems, where subdivision is common. The results also shed light on the conditions necessary for subdivision to accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. They used high-resolution mass spectrometry to examine the metabolic changes that occur in the midgut tissue following dengue virus infection. The midgut is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic viral dissemination and transmission.

The study found that dengue virus infection leads to a dynamic remodeling of lipids in the midgut, with a marked increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls coinciding with the kinetics of viral replication. The researchers also observed an elevation of glycerolipid levels, suggesting a diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Additionally, elevated levels of acyl-carnitines were detected, indicating disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production.

A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway was identified as critical for the virus life cycle. The study also resulted in the first reconstruction of the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti. Given the conservation of replication mechanisms among several flaviviruses transmitted by this vector, the findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the rabbit heart's electrical activity, known as the action potential (AP), to better understand the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Existing AP models are complex and varied, making it difficult to identify the essential physiological requirements for certain phenomena. The new model, called a "parsimonious" model, combines a novel formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization, similar to the rectifying potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery of AP excitability, and steady-state INa inactivation. Simulations using the model reproduced several important phenomena, including cellular alternans at high heart rates, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. The study found that the minimal requirements for these phenomena are the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK. The simplicity and physiological meaning of the model's parameters make it an ideal tool for gaining mechanistic insight and developing more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology.
Researchers studied the process of genome assembly in the ciliate Paramecium during its sexual cycle. This process involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). These sequences are flanked by two TA dinucleotides and are excised through the introduction of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The DSBs are initiated by the domesticated transposase PiggyMac and have a characteristic geometry with 4-base 5' overhangs centered on the conserved TA.

The researchers found that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), are required for the repair of IES excision sites and the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle, and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends.

The study demonstrates that IES excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism involving the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This process is essential for the assembly of functional open reading frames in the somatic genome. The researchers conclude that the Lig4p-Xrcc4p complex, a key actor of the NHEJ pathway, carries out DSB repair during developmentally programmed IES excision in Paramecium.
Researchers conducted a subanalysis of the REMADHE prospective trial to study the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing it with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. The study analyzed 342 patients and found that 185 (54.1%) died, with 56.4% of deaths occurring in Chagas patients and 53.7% in non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups.

The Cox regression model revealed that Chagas etiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and the use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. In contrast, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and the use of beta-blockers were independently associated with sudden death mortality. The study found that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications for the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death. The study highlights the need for a precise understanding of the natural history of patients with systolic dysfunction to plan adequate health policies and improve survival.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which plant cells defend against geminiviruses, a type of plant virus. The defense pathway involves a protein called NIK1, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rpL10A. When NIK1 is activated, it phosphorylates rpL10A, causing it to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This movement is crucial for the plant's defense against the virus. The virus, however, has a countermeasure to prevent this defense mechanism. The virus's nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) binds to NIK1, inhibiting its kinase activity and preventing rpL10A from moving to the nucleus. As a result, rpL10A is trapped in the cytoplasm, where it cannot perform its defensive function. This interaction between NIK1 and NSP is conserved among different geminiviral NSPs and NIK homologs from various hosts. The researchers also found that the loss of rpL10A function makes plants more susceptible to geminivirus infection, similar to the effect of a mutation in the NIK1 gene. Furthermore, the virus infection interferes with the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of rpL10A, causing it to form punctate corpuscles in the cytoplasm. The study suggests that the NIK1-mediated defense signaling pathway may be involved in restricting the host range of other viruses, but it does not activate RNA silencing or promote a hypersensitive response, and instead inhibits plant growth and development.
A study investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes a serious lung infection in humans. The researchers found that AOX helps the fungus survive inside the host by protecting it from oxidative stress caused by immune cells. They created a strain of the fungus with reduced AOX expression and tested its interaction with immune cells and in a mouse model of infection. The results showed that the fungus with reduced AOX expression had lower viability when exposed to immune cells and was less able to establish infection in mice. In contrast, the fungus with normal AOX expression was more resistant to oxidative stress and better able to infect mice. The study suggests that AOX plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to evade the host's immune response and establish infection. The findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and may lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.
Researchers investigated the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region, in supporting episodic-like memory. They tested whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells by morphing one familiar context into another and observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. The results showed that average population activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics.

A neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts was developed to understand the seemingly conflicting results. The model found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. This resulted in smooth transition curves when averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels, similar to what was experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. The results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells, and similar mechanisms may be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and extra-intestinal abscesses in millions of people living in endemic areas. The parasite's trophozoites are exposed to various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E. histolytica lacks key components of the canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense system, alternative defense strategies have been proposed. Researchers investigated the global metabolic responses of E. histolytica to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat (PQ)-mediated oxidative stress using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The study found that oxidative stress caused significant changes in metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Oxidative stress inhibited glycolysis by inactivating key enzymes, leading to a redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. As a result, glycolytic intermediates accumulated upstream of pyruvate, and nucleoside triphosphate levels decreased. The study also identified a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, demonstrated by increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress. The researchers propose that the glycerol biosynthetic pathway serves as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica.
IKAROS is a crucial regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, and its dynamic expression pattern is necessary for proper hematopoiesis. Research has shown that IKAROS collaborates with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex to promote gene repression and activation. However, the mechanism by which IKAROS supports transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing complex NuRD was unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of IKAROS in transcription elongation and its interaction with the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) complex.

The study found that NuRD and P-TEFb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α) to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant that cannot bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impairs normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the study revealed that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and promotes transcription elongation.

The results suggest that IKAROS is the DNA-binding subunit of the NuRD-P-TEFb multifunctional complex, which contains chromatin remodeling (NuRD) and gene transcription elongation (P-TEFb) activities. IKAROS is essential for CDK9 and Mi2 interaction and combined recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematopoietic cells. The study provides mechanistic insights into the central role played by IKAROS as a transcriptional activator during hematopoietic lineage decision, differentiation, and interaction with the niche.
A recent study investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses (RABV) associated with outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. The researchers analyzed RABV sequences from 1997 to 2010 and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to determine whether outbreaks were caused by in situ evolution or the importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland. The study found that Trinidadian RABV sequences belonged to the bat-associated Clade 2 and clustered into three largely temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I, IIa, and IIb. The Trinidad I lineage was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, while the Trinidad II lineage was most closely related to sequences from Brazil and Uruguay.

Phylogeographic analyses suggested that there were three separate RABV introductions from the mainland, each giving rise to one of the three Trinidadian lineages. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions indicate periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. The study also found evidence of co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa in 2000. The researchers suggest that further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, particularly any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers developed a computational model to study the gene regulatory network underlying the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The model focused on five genes: Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, which play a crucial role in specifying area identity along the anterior-posterior axis. The model treated gene expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the available data. By simulating all possible networks containing these five genes, the researchers found that only a subset of networks could reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks lacked certain interactions, such as auto-regulation and inductive loops, and higher-order combinations of interactions. The analysis revealed that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. The model suggests that Fgf8 expression at the anterior pole can drive the correct spatial patterning of the other transcription factors if simple interactions between them exist. The study provides insights into the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the regulatory interactions between these genes to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical area development.
Researchers used a technique called ChIP-Seq to study the distribution of a protein modification called ubiquitylated histone H2A (uH2A) across the entire mouse genome. This modification is associated with the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. The study focused on the role of Bmi1, a component of the PcG complex, in depositing uH2A at specific genes. The results showed that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched at the promoters of genes that are repressed, or turned off, in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Promoters are the regions of DNA where genes are turned on or off. The study found that genes with high levels of uH2A at their promoters have lower expression levels compared to genes without uH2A. Furthermore, when Bmi1 is knocked out, genes with high levels of uH2A at their promoters are expressed at higher levels. This suggests that Bmi1-dependent uH2A plays a role in repressing gene expression. The study also found that uH2A is not limited to regions with the H3K27me3 mark, a different protein modification associated with PcG proteins. Instead, uH2A is also found at high-density CpG promoters, which are regions with high levels of DNA methylation. The study suggests that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at these regions, and that Bmi1-dependent uH2A may employ a different mechanism in differentiated cells compared to embryonic stem cells.
Researchers have identified a noncoding RNA called pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) that plays a crucial role in regulating the development of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy. PINC is highly expressed in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and declines in early lactation, when alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation to produce milk. The study found that PINC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitor cells, suggesting that it may help maintain these cells in an undifferentiated state. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of PINC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of PINC enhances differentiation, indicating that PINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells. The researchers also found that PINC interacts with the retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in epigenetic regulation. This complex may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. The study suggests that PINC's role is to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition, and that its downregulation is necessary for lactation to occur. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the regulation of mammary epithelial cell development and differentiation during pregnancy and lactation.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which cells defend against retroviruses, such as HIV-1. The protein PML, also known as TRIM19, plays a key role in this defense mechanism. PML is typically found in the nucleus, where it forms structures called PML nuclear bodies that recruit other proteins. However, when cells are infected with retroviruses, PML is rapidly re-localized to the cytoplasm, where it forms PML cytoplasmic bodies. This re-localization occurs as early as 30 minutes after infection and peaks at 2 hours post-infection. The formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription and is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors. Furthermore, PML knockdown increases reverse-transcription efficiency, suggesting that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection. The researchers found that PML acts through its partner protein Daxx, which is stabilized by PML and inhibits retroviral reverse-transcription. Daxx not only interferes with exogenous retroviral infections but also inhibits the retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, making it a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription. This study reveals a novel antiviral function for PML and its associated protein Daxx, providing new insights into the cellular defense against retroviruses.
Researchers have developed a new program, Matt, to improve protein multiple structure alignment, a crucial step in understanding protein function and evolution. The program, Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists, uses a novel approach called aligned fragment pair chaining, which allows for local flexibility between protein fragments. This flexibility enables Matt to better model protein structures, particularly in cases where proteins have more distant homology.

Matt was tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on two benchmark datasets, Homstrad and SABmark. On the Homstrad dataset, which contains highly homologous proteins, Matt's performance was competitive with other programs. However, on the SABmark dataset, which includes proteins with more distant homology, Matt outperformed the other programs. Matt demonstrated an ability to better align the ends of alpha-helices and beta-strands, an important characteristic for constructing a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem.

The researchers also explored the use of Matt alignments to distinguish between distantly homologous structure pairs and non-homologous protein structures. A p-value score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of Matt alignments was able to largely separate decoys from homologous protein structures in the SABmark benchmark dataset. The researchers suggest that Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Greatwall kinase and its substrates, Ensa and ARPP19, during mitotic exit in cells. Greatwall kinase inactivates the phosphatase PP2A/B55, but the dynamic regulation of Greatwall activity and the phosphatases that control Greatwall kinase and its substrates were not well understood. The study used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to monitor the phosphorylation of Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic entry and exit. The results showed that PP2A/B55 is required for the dephosphorylation of Greatwall at a critical site, and that the RNA Polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1 mediates the dephosphorylation of Ensa/ARPP19. Surprisingly, inhibiting or depleting Fcp1 or PP2A did not block the dephosphorylation of most mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases that coordinate the dephosphorylation of Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic exit. The results also indicate that PP2A/B55 is primarily responsible for inactivating Greatwall, but other phosphatases also contribute to its inactivation. The study provides new insights into the regulation of mitotic exit and the role of phosphatases in this process.
Researchers studied two individuals with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection to understand how the virus evades neutralizing antibodies (Nab) produced by the immune system. Neutralizing antibodies are proteins that can limit the replication of the virus and prevent new infections. The study found that despite the development of high levels of Nab, the virus was able to escape neutralization through multiple pathways. In one individual, escape was driven by changes in the V3V5 region of the virus's envelope protein, while in the other individual, escape was driven by changes in the V1V2 region. Notably, the virus's ability to escape was not due to a single mutational pathway, but rather a combination of strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking. The study suggests that the HIV-1 subtype C virus is uniquely equipped to respond to the immune response of each individual host by adjusting its pathways of escape. The findings have implications for the development of an effective HIV vaccine, which aims to elicit neutralizing antibodies that can limit the replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent new infections.
Researchers studied the genomes of 13 individuals from the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand the extent of positive and negative selection across different parts of the genome. They found that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, when looking at noncoding regions that are conserved across the Brassicaceae family, they found strong signals of selection. The study also showed that genes with higher expression levels experience stronger negative selection, but similar levels of positive selection as genes with lower expression levels. This suggests that both positive and negative selection are widespread in coding and regulatory regions of the C. grandiflora genome. However, the study found that positive and negative selection on noncoding sequences in plants are less common than in animal genomes. The researchers identified conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) across nine Brassicaceae genomes and found that a large proportion of noncoding DNA may evolve neutrally. The study's findings have implications for understanding genome function and the maintenance of genetic variation in plants.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transforms resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. The EBV-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 plays a crucial role in this process by driving the formation of new binding sites for two master regulators of B-cell fate, RBP-jκ and EBF1. Unlike previous studies, which suggested that these B-cell factors are statically bound to target gene promoters, EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with the transcriptional activation of linked genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, as the number of RBP-jκ binding sites is largely increased. EBNA2 colocalizes with EBF1 and RBP-jκ at many enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. EBNA2 is a potent transcriptional co-activator that is expressed in early stages of EBV-induced proliferation of naïve B-cells, but its expression is extinguished at later stages of B-cell development.
Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, exhibits significant genetic structure and variation in its ability to transmit the virus in Mexico. Research has shown that the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA. This barrier is associated with differences in vector competence (VC) for dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV2). Mosquitoes from populations north of the NVA have an average VC rate of 0.55, while those from populations south of the NVA have an average VC rate of 0.20. Most of this variation is due to midgut infection and escape barriers, with 21.5% of mosquitoes from north of the NVA failing to develop midgut infections and 30.3% of those with an infected midgut failing to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, 45.2% of mosquitoes from south of the NVA failed to develop midgut infections, and 62.8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. The study suggests that barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as VC. Further research is needed to determine why the NVA is a barrier to gene flow and whether the differences in VC seen north and south of the NVA are stable and epidemiologically significant.
Researchers have investigated the role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The DnaA protein cycles between an active ATP-bound form and an inactive ADP-bound form, and it has been suggested that it is the main controller of initiation frequency. However, a recent study has found that increasing the concentration of ATP-DnaA by more than 50% does not affect the timing of replication initiation. This suggests that the DnaA protein is not the limiting factor for the precise timing of initiation of replication.

The study used cell cycle analysis to examine the effect of a surplus of ATP-DnaA on the timing of replication initiation. The results showed that cells with a surplus of ATP-DnaA initiated replication at the same time as wild-type cells, indicating that the timing of initiation is controlled by factors other than the amount of ATP-DnaA. The researchers propose that the DnaA protein is the motor that drives the initiation process, but other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment.

The study also investigated the roles of the DdaH-dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. The results showed that loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein. This suggests that compromised cell cycle machinery performs in a less robust manner. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of DNA replication in E. coli and highlights the importance of other factors in controlling the timing of initiation.
Researchers have developed a new approach called partial Granger causality to analyze interactions in biological systems. This method can identify patterns in multivariate data with external inputs and hidden variables in the frequency domain. The approach was tested with simulated models and applied to real-world data from various sources, including gene microarray data from HeLa cells, local field potentials from the sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and neural activity from a macaque monkey's right hemisphere.

The study aimed to show that a common definition of causality, called partial directed coherence (PDC), can be misleading when used in the frequency domain. PDC can produce conflicting results when compared to time-domain Granger causality. The researchers also demonstrated the limitations of using HeLa microarray data, which has a sampling rate of one hour, making it difficult to analyze fast dynamic activities that occur at a minute scale.

The study used local field potential data from a macaque monkey performing a visual pattern discrimination task. The data showed oscillatory field potential activity in the beta frequency range during the prestimulus period. The researchers applied partial Granger causality to the data and found a different connectivity structure compared to pairwise Granger causality. The results highlight the importance of considering exogenous inputs and latent variables when analyzing complex biological systems.
Researchers have developed new methods for determining the ancestry of specific regions of the genome in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as Latino Americans. This information is crucial for medical and population genetic studies, as it can help identify disease-risk loci, infer recombination rates, and map missing contigs in the human genome. Current methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to utilize the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. The new approach, called Lanc-CSV, leverages continent-specific variants (CSVs) to improve accuracy and efficiency. CSVs are alleles found only in individuals from a specific continental group, and the density of these variants is high enough across the genome to allow for fast and accurate inference of local ancestry. The method incorporates the admixed genomes themselves with public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes project, to improve the accuracy of CSV calling. Simulations show that Lanc-CSV attains accuracy similar to computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with significant reductions in runtime. The method also extends to low-coverage sequencing and sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs), allowing for the determination of sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments. This approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of local ancestry inference in fully sequenced admixed genomes, making it a valuable tool for medical and population genetic studies.
Researchers have found that almost all genes in mammals exhibit a daily oscillation in their expression levels, contrary to previous estimates of 10-15%. This discovery was made possible by applying digital signal processing algorithms to large datasets of gene expression profiles. By analyzing each group of genes that oscillate in the same phase separately, the researchers were able to identify circadian baseline oscillation in nearly 100% of all expressed genes. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous statistical analyses, which were hindered by small dataset sizes and high levels of noise.

The study suggests that circadian oscillation is a natural and important feature of all or nearly all biological pathways. Genes that display daily variation in their expression levels may or may not be directly linked to the circadian molecular clock, but their oscillation will still affect the entire system. The researchers found that the amplitude of core circadian genes does not stand out from the majority of expressed genes and shows no significant variation among different tissues.

The study's findings imply that circadian oscillation should be considered in any study related to biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should be evaluated in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations. This new understanding of circadian oscillation has significant implications for our understanding of biological systems and may lead to new insights into the regulation of gene expression.
Researchers used whole-genome re-sequencing to study recombination events in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They identified 325 crossover events with a median resolution of 1.4 kilobases and localized 86% of these events to regions less than 10 kilobases. The study found that crossover rates were higher in males than females and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with hotspots and a concentration in genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands.

The researchers also identified 267 non-crossover gene conversion events, which were significantly associated with crossover locations. They found a transmission bias in favor of "strong" (G, C) alleles over "weak" (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing evidence for GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. The study's approach can be applied to other species, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the recombination landscape across different organisms. The results suggest that recombination events are often concentrated in specific genomic regions, known as hotspots, and that these hotspots may remain relatively stable over time. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of genetic diversity and evolution.
Researchers have studied the energy landscapes of repeat-containing proteins, which are made up of repeated 20- to 40-amino acid stretches that fold into elongated, non-globular architectures. These proteins have inherent symmetries in their primary sequence and three-dimensional structure, which can be analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem. A general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes has been developed using a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, which are treated as spin variables.

The overall folding properties of a complete "domain" can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding free-energy and the cooperativity of denaturation, which do not apply to globular proteins. The parameters for the "coarse-grained" description can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes.

A case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins illustrates the ideas, and the results are quantitatively related to experimentally observed folding transitions. The study suggests that natural repeat proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics, allowing them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.
Researchers investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. They found that CHOP expression is up-regulated in human HCC tumors and two mouse models of the disease. Mice lacking the CHOP gene (Chop-null mice) were resistant to chemical-induced liver cancer and fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. These mice also showed reduced levels of basal inflammatory signaling in the liver.

The study suggests that CHOP promotes liver cancer by contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. Gene expression profiling in Chop-null mice revealed reduced levels of pro-inflammatory genes, even in the absence of an overt hepatotoxic challenge. This indicates that CHOP plays a role in promoting inflammation and fibrosis, which are known to contribute to the development of HCC.

The researchers propose a stepwise model of HCC development, where CHOP expression leads to fibrosis and tumorigenesis. Understanding the mechanisms by which CHOP promotes oncogenesis may have implications for other cancers beyond HCC. The study reveals a molecular link between HCC and the stimuli that predispose to it, such as viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. Further investigation of CHOP's role in HCC may suggest additional points for potential therapeutic intervention.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethiopica in Ethiopia found that evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. The review identified 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL, with antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy being the most commonly used treatments. However, the study quality was poor, and only two small and/or poor-quality randomized controlled trials were found.

Cure rates for cryotherapy ranged from 60-80%, and 69-85% for antimonials. Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, including cases non-responsive to antimonials. However, all studies had methodological limitations. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B were scarce, and only a few studies were available on diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The only potentially effective treatment options for DCL seem to be antimonials with paromomycin in combination or pentamidine, but none have been properly evaluated.

The evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L. aethiopica is extremely limited. Antimonials remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials on CL due to L. aethiopica are urgently needed to evaluate several options in parallel.
Researchers have successfully reconstituted a biochemical oscillator in a laboratory setting using three purified proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. This in vitro circadian clockwork displays the key characteristics of natural circadian rhythms, including a self-sustaining 24-hour cycle that is resistant to temperature changes. To understand how this oscillator works, the researchers analyzed the interactions between the three proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis. These studies revealed that the proteins form various complexes at different stages of the circadian cycle, with the composition of these complexes changing over time.

A dynamic model was developed based on these findings, which accurately predicts the rhythms of the KaiABC complexes and the phosphorylation of KaiC. The model suggests that the exchange of monomers among KaiC hexamers plays a crucial role in maintaining synchrony among the hexamers and sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation. This was confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, which showed that monomer exchange occurs among KaiC hexamers.

The researchers also used temperature pulses to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, demonstrating that this unique circadian oscillator can be reset by stimuli that are known to entrain natural circadian clocks. Overall, this study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vitro circadian clockwork, shedding light on the complex interactions between the Kai proteins and their role in generating circadian rhythms.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task using electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment. They found an inverted-U relationship between the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity and behavioral performance. Specifically, when the fluctuation in ECoG activity was closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate was higher and reaction times were faster. This relationship was observed not only in post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting that anticipatory brain dynamics play a role. The findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance. The proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance. The study decouples variability reduction from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. The results suggest that both deterministic and stochastic sources of brain variability contribute to the relationship between brain activity and behavior.
Researchers have studied the mating-type loci in basidiomycete fungi to understand the evolution of sexual development in eukaryotes. Mating compatibility in fungi is determined by the mating-type (MAT) loci, which contain homeodomain transcription factor genes (HD locus) and pheromone and pheromone receptor genes (P/R locus). In basidiomycetes, the ancestral state is tetrapolar, with two genetically unlinked MAT loci. However, some species have bipolar mating systems, which can arise through genomic linkage of the HD and P/R loci or loss of function in the P/R locus.

A study analyzed the MAT loci from 24 species of the Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales. The results showed that the MAT loci are fused and contain a single HD gene in each mating type, similar to the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the HD and P/R allele combinations in the Trichosporonales are different from those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. This suggests that the fusion of the HD and P/R loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions.

The study also found that the gene content and gene order within the fused MAT loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, and there is no apparent suppression of recombination extending from the MAT loci to adjacent chromosomal regions. This suggests different mechanisms for the evolution of physically linked MAT loci in the Trichosporonales compared to other fungal groups.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to predict the abundance of non-domiciliated Triatoma dimidiata, a vector of Chagas disease, in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was based on two years of field data and accurately predicted the abundance of the vector in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. The study found that pyrethroid spraying was effective in reducing bug abundance by 80% when applied at a dose of 50 mg/m2 within a two-month period matching the immigration season. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. The study suggests that control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying due to the need for yearly application and accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative for controlling non-domiciliated vectors, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
Researchers have identified the mechanisms behind the precise patterning of feathers in avian skin. During development, feathers first appear as a row along the dorsal midline, with new feather buds added sequentially in a spreading wave. This patterning relies on the interaction of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, along with the movement of mesenchymal cells, in a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system. The system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation and compresses the epidermis to intensify FGF20 expression.

The traveling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A (EDA), which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin forming a feather bud. This process is conserved in flighted birds, but is altered in flightless birds such as the emu and ostrich, which retain the tract arrangement but lay down feather primordia without a wave, similar to the process of hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. The study shows that a reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array, and highlights the key role of the EDA/EDAR pathway in vertebrate skin patterning.
A rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, in body fluids of infected individuals and survivors was conducted. The review aimed to determine which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. A total of 6831 articles were screened, and 33 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies found that most body fluid types had insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and the prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken more than 16 days after the onset of illness were usually negative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for filovirus RNA were positive about four times more often than tissue culture tests in the six studies that used both methods. Filovirus was detected in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR-positive samples are likely to be culture-negative and possibly of low infectious risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood. The review highlights the need for further research to determine the relative infectiousness of various body fluids during and after illness.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to describe the behavior of neurons, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model. This model can capture the complex dynamics of neuronal activity, including power-law behavior and long-range correlations in the membrane voltage. The model uses a fractional derivative, which is a non-local process that takes into account the weighted voltage trace, or memory trace, of the neuron. This allows the model to reproduce the non-Markovian process of neuronal activity, which cannot be characterized by a single time constant.

The fractional model can be adjusted by varying the exponent of the fractional derivative, which determines the weight of the voltage trace. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the voltage trace increase, causing the value of the voltage to be more correlated with the trajectory of the voltage in the past. The model can reproduce experimental findings of upward and downward spike adaptations in neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons in vitro.

The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with a power-law distribution. The researchers analyzed the model's response to noisy and oscillatory input and found that it generates reliable spike patterns. The fractional model deviates from the traditional Markovian model and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation. This new model provides a unified mathematical and computational framework for describing power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity.
Researchers studied the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in the fungus Paracoccidioides, a pathogen that causes paracoccidioidomycosis. SODs are enzymes that help defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host's immune cells. The study identified six SOD isoforms in the Paracoccidioides genome and analyzed their expression in different stages of the fungus's life cycle, including yeast and mycelia forms. The researchers found that two SODs, PbSOD1 and PbSOD3, were highly expressed during the transition from yeast to mycelia, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells. This suggests that these SODs play a crucial role in combating superoxide radicals generated during the host-pathogen interaction. Using knockdown strains, the researchers showed that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the fungus's response to oxidative stress and host effector cells. Protein sequence analysis indicated that PbSOD3 has a pronounced extracellular activity, while PbSOD1 is more related to intracellular requirements. The study suggests that Paracoccidioides actively responds to internal and external oxidative stress by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms, which helps the fungus counteract the oxidative burst of immune cells.
Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaperone binding in various species, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. Contrary to expectations, the study found that IDPs do not preferentially bind to chaperones in vivo. Instead, predicted disorder negatively correlates with chaperone binding, indicating that IDPs tend to avoid being bound to chaperones.

The analysis of high-throughput interaction data revealed that proteins with predicted disorder are less likely to bind to chaperones compared to proteins with ordered structures. This effect is observed across different taxonomic groups, including prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and metazoa. Furthermore, the presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam domains, is associated with a higher likelihood of chaperone binding.

The study suggests that chaperone binding is primarily required for the folding of globular proteins, rather than for IDPs. Instead, IDPs that bind chaperones tend to also bind other proteins, indicating that chaperones may facilitate the assembly of IDPs with their partners. This is supported by the observation that IDPs that bind chaperones are more likely to bind other proteins compared to ordered proteins. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the role of chaperones in the cell and the behavior of IDPs.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Spalt transcription factors, encoded by the Drosophila genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr), in the development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing. These transcription factors are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway and are essential for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the wing disc, as well as vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of wing growth and patterning, the researchers identified direct Salm and Salr target genes by comparing the expression profiles of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs using microarray experiments. In situ hybridization revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins, including both activated and repressed genes. Candidate Salm/Salr target genes were identified, and loss-of-function analysis showed that some of these genes are required for wing growth and patterning. This study provides new insights into the genetic hierarchy acting downstream of Dpp signaling in the wing disc and sheds light on the mechanisms by which Sal proteins regulate transcription. The findings suggest that the Spalt transcription factors play a central role in mediating the effects of Dpp signaling during wing disc development, and that their target genes are involved in regulating cell proliferation, viability, and vein pattern formation.
Researchers have found that a protein called Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of ZYG-1, a protein essential for centriole duplication in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Centriole duplication is a critical process in cell division, and its dysregulation has been linked to tumorigenesis and microcephaly in humans. The study identified two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators, I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. The researchers found that down-regulating PP1 activity either directly or by mutating szy-2 or sds-22 can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, indicating that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication in a zyg-1 mutant, but strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification, resulting in the production of more than one daughter centriole. The study defines a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle, highlighting the importance of PP1 in regulating centriole duplication.
Researchers investigated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in an environmentally protected area (EPA) in southeastern Brazil, where the disease was first reported in 2009 in a dog living in a residential condominium. The study aimed to understand the role of wildlife in VL transmission and identify potential vectors and reservoirs. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted in 2013 and 2015, involving domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies. The results showed that 1.5% and 1.2% of domestic dogs were seropositive for Leishmania spp. in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species of sand flies, including the main vector Lutzomyia longipalpis, were identified, and two specimens were found to be infected with Leishmania infantum. Natural infection was also detected in two white-eared opossums, a known reservoir of VL. The study found that the EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus, and the risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios is evident. The results suggest that wild mammals may play a role in VL transmission, and different epidemiological profiles of VL must be considered to develop effective prevention and control measures. The study highlights the importance of understanding the particularities of each transmission area to prevent and control the spread of the disease.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded microRNA miR-BART9 promotes tumor metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by targeting E-cadherin, a protein that maintains cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype. Researchers investigated the role of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC cells using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. They found that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells in vitro and enhances metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that miR-BART9 targets E-cadherin, and biochemical assays confirmed that miR-BART9 specifically inhibits E-cadherin, inducing a mesenchymal-like phenotype and promoting NPC cell migration. The study suggests that high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells. The researchers also found that miR-BART9 shares a "seed sequence" with the miR-200 family, which is down-modulated in NPC tumors, and that the high abundance of miR-BART9 in NPC tissues may drive epithelial carcinoma cells to adopt a mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced motility. Overall, the study identifies miR-BART9 as a prometastatic viral microRNA that plays a significant role in the highly metastatic behavior of NPC tumors.
Researchers have developed a new command-line tool called ggsashimi for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. This tool creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments. Unlike existing versions of sashimi plot-generating programs, ggsashimi uses popular bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and can visualize splicing events in large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites. The tool is implemented in Python and generates R code for plotting.

The development of ggsashimi aims to address limitations of current sashimi plot implementations, which are often annotation-dependent and not dynamically integrated in common genome browsers. Visualizing splicing events is challenging because they occur between non-contiguous regions on the genome sequence, which can be distant in linear space. The new tool allows for the aggregation of samples belonging to the same group and shrinkage of intron lengths, enhancing the visualization of splicing events.

Ggsashimi has been compared to the sashimi plot built-in available within the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) browser. The results show that ggsashimi provides a more effective visualization of splicing events, especially for large genomic regions. The tool is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi and can be used for exploratory data analysis of RNA-seq data.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across different species. CRMs are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate gene expression. The new model, called EMMA, uses a probabilistic approach to account for the evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and background sequences. Unlike existing models, EMMA explicitly considers the gain and loss of TFBSs, which is a crucial aspect of regulatory sequence evolution.

The EMMA model improves upon existing alignment methods by using conserved TFBSs to guide the alignment process. It also addresses the uncertainty associated with binding site annotations and sequence alignment by treating them as random variables. The model is implemented as a computational framework that can be used for CRM alignment and prediction.

In simulations and real-world data, EMMA outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in aligning and predicting CRMs. The researchers applied EMMA to study the conservation of binding sites in Drosophila blastoderm genome-wide binding data. They found that factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints, even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm. Additionally, they discovered that binding sites in distal regions (relative to transcription start sites) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. The EMMA software is now available for use in various biological contexts.
Researchers have investigated the role of the piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, to understand its functions in genome maintenance and telomere protection. The piRNA pathway is known to silence transposons, which are mobile genetic elements that can compromise genome integrity, in the germline. However, its functions during development were unclear. The study found that mutations in four piRNA pathway genes, armi, aub, ago3, and rhi, led to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during embryonic divisions. Additionally, mutations in aub and armi resulted in defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and embryonic divisions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that aub and armi mutations disrupted telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduced the expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. In contrast, mutations in rhi and ago3 did not block HOAP binding or production of these piRNAs. The findings suggest that the piRNA pathway has genetically separable functions, with aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 silencing transposons and maintaining chromosome integrity during embryonic divisions, and aub and armi having an additional function in assembling the telomere protection complex. The study reveals a novel function for a subset of piRNA genes in telomere protection, which may be mediated by a novel class of short RNAs that bind to Piwi.
A new species of the Ebola virus, known as Bundibugyo ebolavirus, has been identified as the cause of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda. The outbreak, which occurred in November 2007, resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. This new virus is most closely related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, despite being found in a geographically distant location. The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus has significant implications for the development of diagnostic assays, antivirals, and vaccines against Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The virus is distinct from previously recognized ebolaviruses, including Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, which have case fatality rates of 80-90% and 50-55%, respectively. Studies in non-human primates are needed to compare the pathogenicity of Bundibugyo ebolavirus with other ebolaviruses. Current human prototype ebolavirus vaccines, which include Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, may not provide adequate protection against Bundibugyo ebolavirus, highlighting the need for cross-protection studies. The rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases in the affected area were facilitated by the transfer of diagnostic assays to the Uganda Virus Research Institute during the outbreak.
Researchers analyzed a large dataset of 648 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years to understand the progression of the disease. They used the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) to categorize the patients into seven stages of AD, from normal aging to severe dementia. The researchers found that the duration of GDS/FAST stages 4-6 varied significantly among patients, with standard deviations comparable to their mean values. This indicates a high degree of heterogeneity in the progression of AD, suggesting that patients may have different patterns of cognitive and functional decline.

The study's findings are consistent with previous reports of variability in AD progression rates, which can range from months to decades. The researchers propose that a combination of factors may contribute to this variability. The study's extensive longitudinal dataset, spanning 23 years, provides a comprehensive representation of patients at various stages of AD, from GDS/FAST stages 4-7. The results have implications for evaluating the outcomes of clinical studies and may indicate the existence of subgroups of AD patients with distinct patterns of decline. Overall, the study highlights the complexity and variability of AD progression, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the underlying causes of this heterogeneity.
Researchers have developed a computer model of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory formation, to study the role of adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in memory processing. The model was designed to mimic the hippocampus's ability to adapt to changing environments and encode memories. The study found that additive neurogenesis, a process where new neurons are added to the network over time, was a more effective adaptation strategy than conventional synaptic plasticity or neuronal turnover. This is because additive neurogenesis allowed the network to respond to changes in the input statistics while preserving representations of earlier environments.

The researchers extended the model to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. They compared the performance of the network across a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. The results confirmed that additive neurogenesis was a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns.

The study also introduced a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells. This rule was found to have an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. The researchers also examined the time course of adult neurogenesis over the lifetime of an animal raised under different hypothetical rearing conditions, providing a theoretical prediction that could be tested experimentally.
African trypanosomes, a type of parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle, rely on cytosolic peroxidases to protect their lysosomes from oxidative damage. Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles responsible for breaking down and recycling cellular waste and foreign substances. In the absence of these cytosolic peroxidases, the lysosomes of bloodstream trypanosomes undergo rapid damage, leading to cell lysis and death. This damage is triggered by iron, which is acquired by the parasites through endocytosis of host transferrin. The iron chelator deferoxamine and apo-transferrin, a form of transferrin without iron, attenuate the lysis of trypanosomes lacking the cytosolic peroxidases. In contrast, supplementing the medium with iron or transferrin exacerbates the damage. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the lysosome disintegrates before the mitochondrion, suggesting that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage. The mitochondrial peroxidase, Px III, is not essential for parasite survival in vivo, and the cytosolic peroxidases play a crucial role in protecting the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. This process is linked to the high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei. The study highlights the importance of cytosolic peroxidases in maintaining the integrity of the lysosome and preventing oxidative damage in African trypanosomes.
Researchers have inactivated the Pmel gene in mice to study its role in melanosome shape and pigmentation. Melanosomes are organelles in pigment cells where melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color, is produced. The Pmel gene encodes an amyloidogenic protein that forms fibrils within melanosomes, contributing to their characteristic rod shape. In mice lacking the Pmel gene (Pmel−/−), melanosomes are spherical rather than rod-shaped. Despite this, the effect on visible pigmentation is mild, with only a weak dilution of eumelanin, the type of melanin responsible for brown and black colors. This suggests that other proteins may compensate for the loss of Pmel in pigment cells. The Pmel−/− mice are viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects, indicating that Pmel is not essential for the general survival of pigment cells. However, the mice do have a reduced eumelanin content in their hair, demonstrating that Pmel plays a critical role in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation. The study provides new insights into the function of Pmel and its role in melanosome shape and pigmentation, and highlights the complexity of melanin production in pigment cells. The findings also suggest that previously described alleles in vertebrates with striking effects on pigmentation may be dominant-negative mutations rather than loss-of-function mutations.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of environmental methods for dengue vector control was conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. The review included 19 studies that met the eligibility criteria, with 16 contributing data to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites.

The results showed that all environmental methods had some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, the study quality was a major issue, with most studies assessed as low or medium quality. The meta-analysis found that container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions in the Breteau index, while container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects on the pupae per person index.

The study suggests that environmental interventions can be effective in controlling the immature stages of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence. The review highlights the importance of environmental methods as a sustainable and safe approach to dengue vector control, with limited risks of environmental contamination and toxicity.
Researchers have identified small molecules that selectively stall protein synthesis by the ribosome, a process that could lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating diseases. One such compound, PF-06378503 (PF8503), inhibits the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduces LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. However, the impact of PF8503 on cell physiology and ribosome quality control pathways is not well understood. To investigate this, a genome-wide CRISPRi screen was conducted to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503. The screen revealed that the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3 bind to the ribosome and protect cells from the toxic effects of PF8503. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments showed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2 and functions downstream of HBS1L. These findings provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and could aid in the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.
Researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes the destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) to evade immune detection and block host gene expression. The virus achieves this through the activity of its SOX protein, which stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover via aberrant polyadenylation. This process involves the extension of poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. The study found that SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function and that inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. The researchers also identified nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins as critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. This study provides new insights into the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells and reveals a novel mechanism of host shutoff by KSHV. The findings suggest that SOX-induced alterations in mRNA processing events may render nascent RNAs targets of cellular quality control machinery, leading to their destruction. The study's results have implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression and the mechanisms by which viruses evade immune detection.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFNλ) in the immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that these bacteria induce the production of IFNλ in the lung, which is essential for host defense. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor (IL-28R) showed improved clearance of the bacteria and reduced lung pathology compared to control mice. This was associated with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway.

In human epithelial cells, IFNλ was shown to inhibit the microRNA miR-21, leading to the upregulation of PDCD4, a protein that promotes inflammatory signaling. In mice infected with either pathogen, miR-21 was reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild-type mice, but not in IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with S. aureus resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production.

These findings suggest that IFNλ promotes inflammation during bacterial pneumonia by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4. The study highlights the importance of IFNλ and PDCD4 in the innate immune response to airway pathogens. The selective expression of IL-28R on epithelial cells may also play a role in the specific cytokine responses evoked by different pathogens. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to bacterial infections.
Researchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo conducted a 23-year study on mortality trends and risk factors in patients with advanced stage-2 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The study analyzed data from 781 patients admitted to the National Reference Center for HAT between 1989 and 2012. The researchers found that death rates varied depending on the treatment regimen used. The standard melarsoprol schedule had a death rate of 17.2%, while the short schedule melarsoprol had a death rate of 12.1%. The first-line eflornithine treatment had a death rate of 5.4%, and the NECT treatment regimen had a death rate of 9.1%. However, patients who received eflornithine due to their severe clinical status had a high death rate of 36%. After adjusting for treatment, the researchers found that clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid, and high cytorachy were significant predictors of death. A multivariable analysis within treatment groups confirmed that clinical status on admission and high protidorachy were significant predictors of death. The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in assessing disease severity and the need for standardized assessment tools. The researchers suggest that their algorithm for initial clinical status assessment could be used as a basis for developing standardized tools for HAT management and epidemiological reporting.
Researchers have developed a new computer vision pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social interaction dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster, a common model organism for studying social behavior. The pipeline allows for the reliable tracking and analysis of large groups of flies, enabling the study of social network dynamics in response to isolation. Using this pipeline, the researchers found that isolation significantly enhances individual and local social network parameters, such as near-neighbor relationships, in a short period of time. They also explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that gene expression alterations occurred largely on the first day of isolation. These changes were mostly in metabolic genes, and the researchers verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase in lipid content in isolated flies. The study provides new insights into the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila. The findings suggest that flies alter their physiology and behavior to promote social interactions with neighboring flies as early as the first day of isolation, and that these changes are long-lasting. The study highlights the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying the effects of isolation on social behavior and its underlying mechanisms.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines. The study aimed to improve clinical guideline adherence in resource-limited settings. A smartphone-based decision-support tool, developed with end-user input, was evaluated in two hospitals during the 2015 cholera season. The tool included a modality for age-based weight estimation, a dehydration assessment guide, and treatment recommendations.

The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period, with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, with 325 in the pre-intervention group and 516 in the intervention group. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc.

The results showed that during the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both hospitals, with risk ratios of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. When IV fluids were prescribed, the volume better adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased. Zinc adherence also increased.

The study demonstrated that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence. The findings suggest that technology-enabled decision-support tools can promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings. The study identified opportunities to improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection.
Scientists have long struggled to predict how changes in temperature will affect the dynamics of host-parasite interactions, which are crucial for understanding the spread and severity of diseases. A new study provides empirical evidence that the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) can be used to describe the temperature dependency of within-host parasite dynamics. The researchers used a mechanistic model to analyze data from Daphnia magna, a small crustacean, and its natural parasite, Ordospora colligata, across a range of temperatures. They found that the model effectively predicted host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection at different temperatures, using fewer parameters than traditional models.

The study demonstrates that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. This approach has the potential to improve predictions of how climate change will alter host-parasite dynamics and disease. The researchers used the metabolic theory of ecology to describe the thermal dependencies of host aging and mortality, parasite virulence, population growth rate, and equilibrium abundance. This framework provides a valuable approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites in light of climate change. The study's findings serve as a proof of concept for using MTE-based models to understand the impacts of temperature changes on disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of GABAergic interneurons in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. These interneurons play a crucial role in controlling the distribution of inhibition onto PCs, but the specific contributions of different interneuron types are not well understood. A new study proposes a functional role for a network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons.

The study suggests that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, while mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells allows weak inputs to VIP interneurons to be translated into large changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, the researchers demonstrate that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. The study also shows that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.

The researchers propose that this network motif is optimized to efficiently control the PV/SOM-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition, and that it acts as an amplifier that translates weak input onto VIP cells into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs. This amplification is supported by mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons, which allows for switch-like spatial shifts of somato-dendritic inhibition.
Microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) are used to link specific microbes to host phenotypes, such as disease. However, these studies can produce spurious associations due to indirect effects of microbial interactions. Researchers found that realistic microbial interactions can generate a large number of indirect associations that do not provide mechanistic insight. To address this issue, a new method called Direct Association Analysis (DAA) was developed using techniques from statistical physics. This method removes indirect associations and was applied to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The results showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD. The study suggests that many previously reported associations between microbiota and IBD could be indirect. The researchers estimated the relative contribution of indirect associations to MWAS and showed how to isolate direct from indirect associations. They found that interspecific interactions are strong enough to generate detectable changes in the abundance of many microbes not directly linked to host phenotype. The study highlights the importance of accounting for microbial interactions in MWAS to avoid spurious associations and gain a better understanding of the relationship between microbiota and host phenotypes.
Researchers compared the effectiveness of two Wolbachia infection models in blocking the replication and transmission of dengue and West Nile viruses in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia is a bacterium that can be introduced into mosquitoes to prevent the spread of certain diseases. The study used two types of Wolbachia infection models: stable transinfected and transiently infected mosquitoes. In stable transinfected mosquitoes, Wolbachia is inherited by the mosquito's offspring, while in transiently infected mosquitoes, Wolbachia is only present in the mosquito's body for a short time. The researchers found that Wolbachia had a similar blocking effect on dengue and West Nile viruses in both types of infection models. However, the magnitude of the blocking effect was lower in transiently infected mosquitoes. The study also found no evidence that Wolbachia enhanced the infection of either dengue or West Nile viruses in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This suggests that Wolbachia could be a safe and effective way to restrict the transmission of these viruses. The results of this study provide new insights into the interaction between Wolbachia, its host, and disease-causing pathogens, and could inform the development of new strategies for controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
Researchers studied the structure and function of cilia in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play a crucial role in signal transduction. In C. elegans, the cilia shafts of sensory cilia are divided into two regions: a proximal doublet-based region and a distal singlet-based region. The researchers investigated the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the ciliary doublet region and a region termed the "Inversin compartment" (InvC). They found that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. The genes nphp-2, arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis, and can be sorted into two modules: nphp-2+klp-11 and arl-13+unc-119. These genes modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. The researchers also found that glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components, but is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. NPHP-2 requires its calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC. The study concludes that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
Researchers have discovered that the protein Scribble plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers and facilitates the transmission of electrical signals. Oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin in the CNS, undergo significant shape changes to initiate and form myelin sheaths. The study found that Scribble, a protein involved in cell polarity, is essential for oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendrocyte development and is localized to both developing and mature myelin sheaths. When Scribble expression is knocked down in cultured oligodendrocytes, their morphology and myelination are disrupted. Similarly, in mice with Scribble eliminated in myelinating glia, myelin initiation is impaired during development and after demyelination. Scribble also regulates myelin thickness and suppresses the ERK/MAP kinase pathway, which is involved in cell signaling. Furthermore, Scribble localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for axo-glial adhesion. The study suggests that Scribble plays a critical role in myelination and remyelination, and its function may be compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at sites of radial or longitudinal growth. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of Scribble in the development and regeneration of myelin in the CNS.
Researchers have identified a new virulence factor, Listeriolysin S, associated with a subset of Lineage I Listeria monocytogenes strains. These strains are responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks. Listeriolysin S is a haemolytic and cytotoxic peptide that contributes to the pathogen's virulence, as shown in studies using mouse and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based models. This discovery expands the family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs), which were previously thought to be exclusive to Streptococcus species. The genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of Lineage I L. monocytogenes strains may have been revealed through this study. In silico analysis suggests that gene clusters encoding SLS-like factors are also present in other notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The biosynthetic enzymes responsible for SLS production, SagBCD, function similarly to those responsible for microcin B17 modification, McbBCD. Each of these clusters contains a gene capable of encoding a SLS-like peptide, designated Listeriolysin S (LLS), Stapholysin S (STS), and Botulysin S (BTS). This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of several important Gram-positive pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and C. botulinum.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the formation of mycetoma granulomas, a type of granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. Mycetoma granulomas are characterized by the presence of macroscopic structures called grains, which are surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine if IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels are correlated with the severity of the disease and if this correlation is independent of the causative agent.

A total of 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma underwent surgical biopsies, and IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in the mycetoma granuloma were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The results showed that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III. MMP-9 expression was higher in biopsies from Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. A positive correlation was found between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels (p = 0.001). The study also found that MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to disease duration (p < 0.001).

The findings suggest that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in mycetoma granulomas and that their expression levels may be related to the severity of the disease. However, further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL-17 and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and to provide insights into the immunopathogenesis of mycetoma.
Researchers investigated the molecular recognition mechanism of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family, specifically the transcriptional activation domain (EAD), which is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). EAD exhibits characteristics of "fuzziness," including polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The study aimed to understand how EAD interacts with its targets, despite remaining disordered in the bound state.

The researchers hypothesized that polycation-π interactions between EAD's aromatic side chains and basic residues on the target play a crucial role in molecular recognition. They tested this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of EAD sequence variations, including changes in aromatic number, density, and charge. The results supported the cation-π model, suggesting that EAD-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts.

A coarse-grained EAD chain model and an analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of a generic globular target were used to capture the activity trends observed in the experiments. The study provides a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs, which are involved in various biological processes, including cancer. The findings have implications for understanding the roles of IDPs in protein-protein interactions and their involvement in diseases such as Ewing's Sarcoma.
Researchers have investigated the roles of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This study aimed to clarify the functional differences between these two proteases, as previous work had shown that Lon-1 is upregulated in response to blood, while Lon-2 is not. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in their substrate binding domains, suggesting distinct substrate specificities. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro, but did not complement an Escherichia coli Lon mutant. In contrast, Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. These findings indicate that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles in B. burgdorferi. Lon-2 appears to function in a manner consistent with the canonical Lon protease, involved in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, on the other hand, may play a role in host adaptation, particularly during the transition from an arthropod to a warm-blooded host. This is supported by its upregulation in response to blood and its unique presence in the Borrelia genus. The study suggests that Lon-1 may be important for the remodeling of the spirochete outer surface during a blood meal in the tick.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. ADP is a process by which antibodies help phagocytic cells engulf and eliminate pathogens. The study found that HIV-1 virions were not efficiently phagocytosed by phagocytic cells in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. However, when HIV-1 virions were coated with the gp41 protein or gp41-derived peptides, specific antibodies were able to mediate phagocytosis. This suggests that the paucity of envelope spikes on the surface of HIV-1 virions makes it difficult for antibodies to cross-link Fc gamma receptors on phagocytic cells, which is necessary for ADP to occur. In contrast, cells infected with HIV-1 were found to be targets for phagocytosis or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The study's findings indicate that ADP of free virions may not play a significant role in preventing HIV-1 infection, but ADP or trogocytosis could still contribute to clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection. The results suggest that Fc gamma receptor-dependent functions other than ADP of free virions may be critical for maximal prevention or control of HIV-1 infection by antibody.
Hookworm infection, a neglected tropical disease, has a significant global economic and health burden. A computational simulation model estimated that in 2016, hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates, excluding cognitive impairment outcomes. The total productivity losses ranged from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy.

The economic burden of hookworm infection exceeded published estimates for diseases that have received more attention, such as rotavirus. The revised Global Burden of Disease study for 2010 reported 3,230,800 DALYs annually due to hookworm among all ages in 21 regions, including disability weights for additional hookworm outcomes and stratified by level of anemia.

The study found that certain large countries transitioning to higher income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden. Assuming a median likelihood of anemia, 2004 disability weight estimates, and gross national income per capita, 89,765,729 hookworm infections resulted in productivity losses totaling $11.1 billion using one method, $87.9 billion using another method, and $23.1 billion using a third method. The total number of DALYs varied with the probability of anemia given hookworm infection, and there was considerable variation in different countries due to different productivity proxies and disability weight estimates.
Researchers investigated the effects of hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, on the development of the central nervous system (CNS) in zebrafish. They found that hypoxia disrupts the pathfinding of forebrain neurons, leading to errors in which axons fail to cross the midline. This is similar to what has been observed in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers discovered that the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1) pathway is activated in response to hypoxia, leading to increased expression of ephrinB2a, a protein involved in axon guidance. They found that blocking the activity of HIF1α, a key component of the HIF1 pathway, prevented the guidance defects. Additionally, knocking down ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors, suggesting that it is a primary mediator of the HIF1 pathway's effects on axon pathfinding. The researchers also found that magnesium sulfate, a compound used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing the upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and suggest a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing brain and highlights the importance of ephrinB2a in mediating the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding.
Researchers studied pulmonary abnormalities in mice infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a fungal disease of the lungs. The study used high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology to analyze lung lesions in mice infected with the fungus. The researchers found three patterns of lesions: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. These lesions were mainly located around the lung's hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. At four weeks post-infection, 80% of infected mice showed peri-bronchial consolidations and an increase in upper lung density compared to controls. By eight and 12 weeks, consolidation progressed to involve the middle regions of the lungs. Histopathology revealed that consolidation was equivalent to a confluent granulomatous reaction, while nodules corresponded to individual compact granulomas. By 16 weeks, confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi. Discrete focal fibrosis was visible around granulomas, but this finding was only evident through histopathology. The study demonstrated that conventional HRCT is a useful tool for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental mouse PCM. This approach reduces the need to sacrifice a large number of animals and allows for monitoring treatment efficacy in a more rational way.
Researchers investigated the potential of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection. They modified a commercial kit, QuantiFERON, to evaluate five different leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA), and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA). The study included 13 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, 15 cured VL patients, 11 non-endemic healthy controls, and 19 healthy endemic controls.

The results showed that the assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100% in detecting the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active VL was unexpected, as conventional findings suggest a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

The study found that all subjects in all study groups gave positive IFN-γ responses after stimulation with PHA, a non-specific activator of T cells, indicating they were immunocompetent. The assay was positive after stimulation with H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12 peptides, CSA, and SLA in 0%, 9%, 18%, 63%, and 84.6% of subjects, respectively. The highest positive IFN-γ response was observed with SLA in active VL patients. The results suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection.
Researchers have discovered that a toxin called CNFY plays a crucial role in the development of persistent infections caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a type of bacteria that can lead to gastrointestinal infections, relapsing enteritis, and autoimmune disorders. When Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infects the gut, it must navigate through the intestinal epithelium and colonize the underlying lymphatic tissues, a process that triggers a strong immune response from the host. The CNFY toxin enhances the bacteria's ability to evade the immune system by promoting the translocation of antiphagocytic effectors, leading to inflammation, tissue destruction, and alteration of the gut microbiota. However, suppressing the CNFY toxin's function has the opposite effect, leading to increased interferon-γ-mediated responses that promote non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis, allowing the bacteria to establish a persistent infection. This process involves a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response, giving the bacteria a fitness advantage over the host's immune response and enabling it to adopt a commensal lifestyle. The study suggests that the CNFY toxin is a double-edged sword, and its removal is sufficient to dampen inflammation and facilitate the establishment of Yersinia persistence. Further research is needed to understand the precise mechanisms involved in this process, but the findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the host immune system.
Researchers have identified a novel gene, DES1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to colonize and infect rice plants. The DES1 gene is responsible for suppressing the plant's innate defense responses, allowing the fungus to successfully infect the plant. The researchers found that the DES1 gene encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, and its homologs are conserved in other filamentous Ascomycetes.

To study the function of DES1, the researchers created a mutant fungus that lacked the DES1 gene. The mutant fungus, called Δdes1, was unable to infect rice plants as effectively as the wild-type fungus. The researchers found that the Δdes1 mutant was hypersensitive to oxidative stress and had reduced activity of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases. The mutant also exhibited a significant reduction in infectious hyphal extension, leading to a decrease in pathogenicity.

The researchers also found that the Δdes1 mutant triggered strong defense responses in rice plants, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the generation of autofluorescent materials. However, treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, reduced the defense responses in plant tissues challenged with the Δdes1 mutant. The researchers suggest that DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense. The discovery of DES1 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant-fungus interactions and may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling rice blast disease.
Researchers in Ghana evaluated the accuracy of model-based geostatistics (MBG) in predicting the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection, a type of schistosomiasis, in schools across the country. MBG is a method used to predict disease prevalence in areas where it is impractical to conduct surveys. The study compared MBG predictions with empiric prevalence values obtained from school surveys conducted in 79 sites. The results showed that using MBG predictions alone would have led to undertreatment of 28% of children in high-risk schools and unnecessary treatment of 12% of children in schools with no infection. The study suggests that MBG should not be used as a one-time exercise, but rather as an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers. The researchers found that aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level using the current predictive map for Ghana was not adequate for guiding the national schistosomiasis control program. The study highlights the importance of improving the understanding of how to use predictive risk maps to guide treatment delivery decisions, assessment techniques, and modeling approaches to schistosomiasis control. The findings have implications for the use of MBG in other areas where schistosomiasis is endemic.
A heterogeneous mixture of F-series prostaglandins promotes sperm guidance in the Caenorhabditis elegans reproductive tract. These prostaglandins are synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes by Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. Genetics and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry were used to partially delineate the F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways. The results show that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins, which function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PUFA synthesis triggers compensatory up-regulation of prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. The F-series prostaglandin synthesis in Caenorhabditis elegans involves biochemical mechanisms distinct from those in mammalian cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways, yet PGF2α stereoisomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bietti's Crystalline Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. The results support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. This cyclooxygenase-independent pathway for F-series synthesis may be conserved.
Researchers have developed a new approach to reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, which can hinder their development and clinical application. To achieve this, they used algorithms that optimize proteins for both reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. In silico analysis revealed that there is no single optimal solution, but rather a spectrum of designs that balance immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, where no single design exhibits better performance in both criteria.

The researchers designed, constructed, and experimentally evaluated the Pareto frontier of a therapeutic enzyme. They found that various measures of protein performance mapped a functional sequence space that correlated well with computational predictions. This study represents the first systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty associated with pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates.

Eighteen Pareto optimal variants were produced and subjected to a rigorous experimental analysis of key performance parameters. The combined computational and experimental analysis provided new insights into the tradeoffs linking the target enzyme's sequence, function, and immunogenic potential. This work outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmunization of biotherapeutic candidates, which may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
Researchers have discovered that elevated temperatures increase the frequency of meiotic crossovers in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant. Meiotic crossovers are essential for proper chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. The frequency and distribution of these crossovers are influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with more being known about the molecular mechanisms governing intrinsic factors. The study found that elevated temperatures induce hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis, resulting in an increase in meiotic crossovers. Using genetic analysis with mutants in different recombination pathways, the researchers demonstrated that the extra crossovers are derived from the Type I interference-sensitive pathway. This pathway is distinct from the Type II pathway, which is insensitive to interference. The study also showed that heat-induced crossovers are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks and that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response. The findings provide initial insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may have practical applications in plant breeding.
Biomedical researchers face a significant challenge in navigating the vast and rapidly evolving scientific literature, particularly in molecular biomedicine. To address this challenge, a novel computational approach has been developed, which combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. This approach, called the Hanalyzer, extracts information from external resources, tracks knowledge provenance, and enriches the knowledge by noting relationships between genes and calculating a combined reliability score. The Hanalyzer combines the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualizes the combined network in a tool that facilitates knowledge-based analysis.

The Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, leading to the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development. These hypotheses were validated by further experimental work. A Cytoscape plugin, CommonAttributes, was also developed to allow users to trace the provenance of links in the knowledge network and access underlying data sources and publications.

The Hanalyzer can be used to identify functional explanations of a gene list by exploiting inferences not available in individual data sources. It can also be used to create a quantitative network based on experimental data and combine it with the knowledge network in various ways, highlighting linkages in the data that are well supported by existing knowledge or generating novel hypotheses. This approach has the potential to facilitate explanation and hypothesis generation in biomedical research.
Researchers have identified the surface molecules on extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica that facilitate their internalization by host cells. EVs are small, membrane-bound particles released by the parasite that can be taken up by host immune cells, modulating the host's immune response. The study focused on two sub-populations of EVs, termed 15k and 120k EVs, which differ in size and cargo. Using a biotin reagent to capture proteins on the surface of these EVs, the researchers identified 380 surface proteins, including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis and trafficking.

Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 120k EVs originate from the parasite's excretory system, while the 15k EVs are released from the gut epithelial cells. A lectin microarray strategy was used to profile the surface oligosaccharides of intact EVs, showing that the 15k and 120k EVs have similar glycoconjugate profiles, distinct from the parasite's surface tegument. The study also found that the EVs' surface oligosaccharides are resistant to certain enzymes, but can be remodeled by glyco-amidase PNGase F, blocking their uptake by host macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies against specific EV surface proteins enhanced their internalization by host cells. This research sheds light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells, highlighting the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica.
Researchers have identified a protein called CDF2 that plays a crucial role in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants. miRNAs are small RNA molecules that help control gene expression and are essential for plant development. CDF2 interacts with an enzyme called Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) to regulate the processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into mature miRNAs. The study found that CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of certain miRNA genes, acting as a transcription activator or repressor to control their expression. Additionally, CDF2 affects the processing of pri-miRNAs by DCL1, further regulating the levels of mature miRNAs.

CDF2 was found to work in the same pathway as two well-studied miRNAs, miR156 and miR172, which control flowering in plants. The study suggests that CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain proper levels of mature miRNAs, which is essential for plant development. The researchers also found that CDF2 regulates the expression of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, which may affect the overall process of miRNA production. Furthermore, the study implicated that CDF2 may regulate miRNA biogenesis indirectly by controlling the expression of miRNA processing proteins. The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex regulation of miRNAs in plants and highlight the importance of CDF2 in controlling plant development.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) in the communication between oocytes and granulosa cells in the mouse ovary. GGPP is a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, a process that adds a lipid molecule to proteins to modify their function. The study found that GGPP levels increase in oocytes during early follicular development, and its depletion impairs the communication between oocytes and granulosa cells. This communication is essential for the proliferation of granulosa cells and the transition from primary to secondary follicles, a critical phase of folliculogenesis.

The researchers discovered that GGPP depletion inhibits the geranylgeranylation of specific proteins, including Rho GTPase and Rab27a, which are involved in cell adhesion and secretion, respectively. As a result, the physical connection between oocytes and granulosa cells is disrupted, leading to impaired granulosa cell proliferation and primary-secondary follicle transition. The study also found that GGPP administration restored the defects in oocyte-granulosa cell contact, granulosa cell proliferation, and primary-secondary follicle transition in mice with depleted GGPP.

The findings suggest that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation is essential for the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and the regulation of primary-secondary follicle transition. This process is critical for female reproductive function, as it provides ova for later reproductive life. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying folliculogenesis and highlights the importance of GGPP in this process.
Researchers have developed a structural model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation complex with a complete transcription bubble to better understand how nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates enter the active site of the enzyme. Pol II is a crucial enzyme in eukaryotic cells that synthesizes messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite previous studies, it was unclear whether the "secondary channel" or the "main channel" was the primary route for NTP entry. To address this, the researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble using existing structural data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The model revealed that both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, but the secondary channel has a higher percentage of MD conformations with enough space for NTP loading. Further analysis using MD simulations showed that the main channel is disfavored for NTP diffusion due to electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the negatively charged backbone of the non-template DNA strand. The results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. This study provides new insights into the structural basis of Pol II transcription and highlights the importance of the secondary channel in facilitating NTP entry.
A recent study assessed the degree of underrecognition of dengue disease burden in Thailand and Cambodia. Although dengue is a reportable disease in both countries, the actual number of cases may be significantly higher than reported. The study used data from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective cohort studies to estimate the magnitude of underrecognition and establish more accurate disease burden estimates. Cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 years old in two provinces in Thailand and one province in Cambodia over at least two dengue seasons. The results showed that the average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1,000 in Thailand and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Age-group specific multiplication factors (MFs) were calculated by comparing cohort study data to national surveillance data and ranged from 0.4 to 29. These MFs were then applied to country-level reporting data to estimate the true number of dengue cases. The study found that in Thailand, a median of 229,886 dengue cases occurred annually from 2003-2007, while in Cambodia, a median of 111,178 cases occurred in children under 15 years old. The results indicate that national surveillance data significantly underrecognize the true burden of dengue disease, with an average underrecognition of 8.7-fold for total cases and 2.6-fold for inpatient cases in Thailand, and 9.1-fold for total cases and 1.4-fold for inpatient cases in Cambodia.
Researchers have discovered that natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in promoting early CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. In a study using mice, scientists found that NK cells accelerate the generation of effector antiviral CD8 T cells by limiting the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β). This is achieved through the early control of MCMV replication, which reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment. As a result, NK cells promote optimal conditions for the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. In contrast, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation. The study demonstrates that the ability of NK cells to respond early to MCMV infection is critical in balancing the intensity of other innate immune responses, preventing early immunopathology, and promoting adaptive immunity. The findings suggest that NK cells serve not only as effector lymphocytes but also as regulators of immune system function, contributing to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and the promotion of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Overall, the study provides new insights into the contributions of NK cells to immunity against viral infections, highlighting their role in controlling the functions of other critical players in the innate antiviral response, such as pDCs, and modulating the cytokine milieu induced early after challenge.
Researchers have investigated the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used as a model organism in plant biology. rRNA genes are essential for protein synthesis, and their expression is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells. In Arabidopsis, multiple copies of rRNA genes are arranged in tandem arrays, but not all copies are transcribed under normal growth conditions. This study aimed to understand the molecular basis controlling the expression of specific sets of rRNA genes.

The researchers identified four major rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis and found that one variant is induced, while the others are repressed or remain unaltered in plants with a disrupted nucleolin-like protein gene (Atnuc-L1). Notably, the most highly represented rRNA gene variant, which is inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in Atnuc-L1 mutants. The study shows that pre-rRNAs in Atnuc-L1 mutants originate from RNA polymerase I transcription and are processed accurately.

The researchers also found that disruption of the Atnuc-L1 gene leads to a loss of symmetrical DNA methylation at rRNA genes without affecting histone epigenetic marks. This suggests that nucleolin plays a crucial role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis. The study reveals a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation and highlights the importance of nucleolin in this process.
Researchers have identified a key interaction between the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins UL29/28 and components of the NuRD complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating HCMV gene expression. The NuRD complex, also known as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase protein complex, is involved in histone deacetylation, a process that affects the structure of chromatin and gene expression. The researchers used a method called rapid immunoisolation of an epitope-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with HDAC1, a component of the NuRD complex. They found that the HCMV proteins UL29/28 and UL38 interact with HDAC1 and other components of the NuRD complex, including MTA2, RBBP4, and CHD4.

Knockdown of the RBBP4 and CHD4 components of the NuRD complex inhibited the accumulation of HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA, suggesting that multiple components of the NuRD complex are necessary for efficient HCMV replication. The researchers also found that transient expression of UL29/28 enhanced the activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, and that this effect required functional NuRD components. This suggests that UL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HCMV replication and the role of the NuRD complex in regulating viral gene expression.
Researchers studied the immune response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in young children to better understand how the body develops antibodies to fight the virus. They used a technique called whole-genome-phage-display libraries (GFPDL) to analyze the antibody repertoire in infants before and after primary RSV infection. The study found that the antibody response to the RSV fusion protein (F) showed modest changes after infection, while the response to the attachment protein (G) increased significantly, with a 100-fold increase in bound phages. The G-reactive epitopes were found to span the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, as well as the central conserved domain (CCD).

The researchers also synthesized panels of F and G antigenic sites to evaluate sera from young children, adolescents, and adults. They found a steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults, with several novel epitopes identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. In contrast, antibody responses to RSV-G were high in children after early RSV infection, but declined significantly in adults. The study suggests that the immune response to RSV-F and RSV-G evolves independently, providing evidence for immune pressure-driven evolution of RSV-G. These findings could inform the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines, to combat RSV disease.
Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been found to have potent macrofilaricidal effects against adult Brugia malayi, a parasitic nematode that causes lymphatic filariasis. Research has shown that emodepside inhibits the motility of adult Brugia malayi by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. The study suggests that the SLO-1 K channel is the primary target of emodepside, with the slo-1f isoform found in male muscles being more sensitive to the drug than the slo-1a isoform found in female muscles. Alternative splicing in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 channel affects the potency of emodepside, with the slo-1f isoform being more sensitive to the drug. In silico modeling identified a binding pocket in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 channel that is affected by these splice variations. The study highlights the importance of evaluating the sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds to prevent under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes. Emodepside has completed first-in-human safety and tolerability studies and is being developed for the treatment of onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. Further research is needed to advance the evaluation of emodepside as a macrofilaricide for the treatment of filarial diseases.
Researchers have identified the antigens responsible for cross-reactivity between Loa loa and Wuchereria bancrofti rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for lymphatic filariasis (LF). The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis relies on RDTs to determine where mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. However, cross-reactivity with Loa loa has hindered LF elimination efforts in loiasis-endemic areas. To address this issue, the researchers used the DH6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed many circulating AD12/DH6.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple Loa loa proteins in LF RDT-positive loiasis sera. These proteins included both secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by dying Loa loa adult worms and/or microfilariae. Unlike the single high molecular weight W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen present in the blood of persons with bancroftian filariasis, reactive Loa loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. These key differences between the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti and Loa loa can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis.
Researchers have identified a new protein, RAB-28, that plays a crucial role in the development and function of primary cilia in cells. Primary cilia are sensory and signaling devices that extend from the surface of most eukaryotic cells and are essential for various physiological and developmental processes. Defects in primary cilia have been linked to inherited disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The study used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model organism to investigate the development and function of primary cilia. By analyzing whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, the researchers identified a unique expression profile for ciliary genes, including RAB-28. They found that RAB-28 is exclusively expressed in ciliated cells and associates with the periciliary membrane, where it behaves as an intraflagellar transport (IFT) cargo via the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) complex. Overexpression of active or inactive forms of RAB-28 led to variant-specific defects in ciliary and sensory pore morphogenesis. The study reveals that RAB-28 is a novel IFT- and BBSome-associated protein with cell-autonomous and non-autonomous roles in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cilia and sensory neuron-supporting cells. The findings provide new insights into the biology of primary cilia and highlight the importance of RAB-28 in cilium development and function.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses. They focused on hippocampal place cells, which respond to specific locations in an environment. The study aimed to determine if the brain can construct an internal representation of space using only the action potentials (spikes) of these cells, without knowing their specific receptive fields.

The researchers found that knowing which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is enough to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space. This information can be used to track the animal's position within the space. Unlike previous approaches, this method does not require knowledge of the place fields or any other functions relating neural responses to position.

The study used a two-dimensional environment and found that the spiking activity of place cells alone can reveal a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space. This suggests that the brain may be able to construct its own internal representations of the environment without relying on external information. The researchers demonstrated that this method can be used to infer global topological features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space, including the animal's position.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β in viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease caused by excessive inflammation. They used a mouse model infected with the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) to study the disease. The study found that mice deficient in the IL-1β receptor (IL-1R1-/-) or treated with an IL-1β antagonist (IL-1Ra) showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that IL-1β plays a key role in the pathogenesis of viral FH.

The researchers also found that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that activates IL-1β, is activated in response to viral infection. Mice deficient in NLRP3 or caspase-1, a component of the inflammasome complex, showed reduced IL-1β production and improved liver function. Additionally, mice deficient in p47phox, a protein involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), also showed reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production.

The study suggests that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis is a critical signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of viral FH. The researchers propose that this pathway is overactivated in response to viral infection, leading to excessive inflammation and liver damage. The study's findings have implications for the development of treatments for viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. Using a new diagnostic tool called multiplex real-time PCR, they analyzed fecal samples from 830 children and found that 34.1% of those with severe anemia and 27.0% of those without severe anemia had hookworm infections. The most common type of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, was found in 26.1% of the children, while Necator americanus was found in 4.9%. The study found a significant association between Ancylostoma duodenale infections and severe anemia, with moderate and high-load infections increasing the risk of severe anemia by 2.49 and 9.04 times, respectively. Additionally, the study found that iron deficiency was positively associated with the intensity of Ancylostoma duodenale infection, with low, moderate, and high-load infections increasing the risk of iron deficiency by 3.63, 16.98, and 44.91 times, respectively. These findings suggest that Ancylostoma duodenale is a key factor in the etiology of severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. The study highlights the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Meiosis is the process by which sex cells, or gametes, are produced, and it requires the precise repair of DSBs to ensure proper chromosome segregation. COM-1 promotes the repair of DSBs through a process called homologous recombination (HR), which generates interhomolog crossovers (COs) necessary for meiotic chromosome segregation. Without COM-1, DSBs are instead repaired through a less accurate process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to a lack of COs, chromosomal abnormalities, and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM-1 acts by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku, which blocks the nuclease EXO-1 and promotes LIG-4-mediated fusion. The study found that COM-1 is not required for the initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but is necessary to channel the programmed DSBs into HR. In contrast to its yeast counterparts, COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but instead promotes meiotic recombination by inhibiting NHEJ. The research highlights the importance of COM-1 in safeguarding timely CO formation and preventing the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis.
Researchers used a goat model to study the immune response to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacteria that causes melioidosis, a disease that can lead to pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The study aimed to identify immunogenic proteins that could be used to develop new diagnostic tests and vaccines. Outbred goats were infected with B. pseudomallei through an aerosol, mimicking the natural route of infection in humans. The researchers analyzed the goats' humoral immune response, which involves the production of antibodies, using ELISA and western blot tests. They found that the goats produced a strong and diverse antibody response to the bacteria, with a greater response to IgG antibodies compared to IgM antibodies. The researchers identified several immunogenic proteins, including chaperone proteins GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK, which were detected in all serum samples after infection. The heat shock protein GroEL1 elicited the strongest antibody response in the goats. A comparison of the goat immune response with human sera showed that many immune-reactive proteins are common between humans and goats with melioidosis. The study suggests that the goat model is a useful tool for studying the immune response to B. pseudomallei and identifying potential diagnostic and vaccine targets. The findings have implications for the development of new treatments and diagnostic tests for melioidosis.
Researchers have long understood that the activation of cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is crucial for initiating mitosis, the process by which a cell divides into two daughter cells. This activation is triggered by a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase of the cell cycle. However, the details of how Cdk1 activation proceeds in mitotic cells have been unclear. To address this knowledge gap, scientists used a novel approach to study the temporal development of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity in single cells. They found that cyclin B1-Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation, a key event in the early stages of mitosis. Furthermore, they discovered that cytoplasmic cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase, a stage of mitosis. The researchers also developed a model describing cyclin B1-Cdk1 activation in human cells, which revealed a striking resemblance to a bistable circuit. Their findings suggest that gradually increasing cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. The study's results indicate that distinct thresholds for cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity exist that control successive mitotic events, and that cyclin B1-Cdk1 levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount needed for mitotic progression.
Researchers studied the immune response of 21 Kenyan women who were infected with HIV-1 and later superinfected with a different strain of the virus. The goal was to understand how superinfection affects the development of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs), which are crucial for protecting against HIV-1. The women were exposed to subtypes A, C, and D of the virus, and their plasma samples were analyzed at a median time point of 2.72 years after superinfection.

The study focused on four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope that are commonly targeted by Nabs in individuals with broad and potent responses. These epitopes include the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. However, the researchers found that superinfection did not induce a dominant Nab response to any of these epitopes in the 21 women. In fact, computational analyses suggested that 20 of the 21 women's Nab responses could not be attributed to a single specificity with high confidence.

These findings are consistent with a model in which superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response. This suggests that vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens may be effective in eliciting a diverse repertoire of Nabs. The study provides new insights into the immune response to HIV-1 superinfection and has implications for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. Research has shown that HCMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are essential for fetal brain development. The transcriptional regulator Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a critical downstream effector of Notch signaling and plays a key role in governing NPC fate and fetal brain development.

This study found that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. The HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes1 degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes1. A C-terminal acidic region in IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 physical interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination.

The study also identified Sp100A, an important component of PML nuclear bodies, as another target of IE1-mediated ubiquitination. The findings suggest a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCMV-induced neurodevelopmental disorders and identifies IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
A recent study investigated the relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression in Drosophila embryos across four species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The researchers analyzed genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning using ChIP-seq and compared it to gene expression levels measured by mRNA-seq. The study found that gene expression levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are not well-explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are more conserved than other binding sites, suggesting that a significant portion of transcription factor binding is weak or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection.

The study also found that transcription factor binding has diverged extensively within the Drosophila genus, with relatively few regions bound by any factor in all four species. The researchers identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence, including alterations of specific motifs for the transcription factors BCD, HB, GT, and KR. Additionally, the study found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance. Overall, the study suggests that transcription factor binding has undergone significant changes along the Drosophila tree with little effect on downstream gene expression.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, to assess the effectiveness of eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis. The study aimed to evaluate the transmission assessment surveys (TAS) used to monitor and evaluate the program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The TAS assesses antigenaemia (Ag) in children in implementation units (IUs) that have completed at least five rounds of MDA with >65% coverage and microfilaria (Mf) levels <1% in monitored sites.

The study found that the prevalence and intensity of Mf were 0.2% and 0.004, respectively, in the survey that covered >70% of the 50,363 population. The corresponding values for Ag were 2.3% and 17.3 Ag-units, respectively. Although the Mf levels in the survey and sentinel/spot check sites were <1% and Ag-level was <2% in children, the study identified 7 "residual" (Mf-prevalence ≥1%, irrespective of Ag-status in children) and 17 "transmission" (at least one Ag-positive child born during the MDA period) hotspots. Antigenaemic persons were clustered both at household and site levels. The study suggests that an Ag-prevalence of ∼1% in children (equivalent to 0.4% community Mf-prevalence) may be a possible threshold value for stopping MDA. The study highlights the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting "hotspots" and adopting evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for TAS.
A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, in controlling dengue vectors and disease transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other methods. The review included 27 studies, of which 11 used temephos alone and 16 used it in combination with other interventions. The results showed that temephos was effective in reducing entomological indices, such as the number of mosquito larvae, when used as a single intervention. However, when used in combination with other methods, temephos did not consistently reduce entomological indices or dengue transmission. The effectiveness of temephos was found to depend on various factors, including the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental conditions. The review also identified limitations in the use of temephos, such as the need for reapplication, reluctance to apply it to drinking water, and operational challenges related to cost, supplies, time, and labor. Overall, the review suggests that temephos can be an effective tool for controlling dengue vectors when used alone, but its effectiveness is uncertain when used in combination with other interventions. The review highlights the need for further research to better understand the impact of temephos on dengue transmission and to identify the most effective strategies for dengue vector control.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, in establishing cohesion at the pericentromere in budding yeast. The pericentromere is the region surrounding the centromere, where sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. The study found that the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are both important for pericentromeric cohesion, but they act through distinct mechanisms. Components of the Ctf19 complex direct the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is essential for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. Cells lacking Csm3 show additive cohesion defects when combined with mutants in the Ctf19 complex. Delaying DNA replication rescues the cohesion defect observed in cells lacking Ctf19 complex components, but not Csm3. The study proposes that the Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3. The Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are highly conserved and play similar roles in pericentromeric cohesion establishment during both mitosis and meiosis.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus that causes dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF), a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis, researchers analyzed the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients with primary dengue infection at three stages: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent.

Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the study identified 60 differential metabolites, including free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. The analysis revealed major perturbed metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathways. These changes suggest a multifactorial nature of human host responses to DENV infection.

The study also found that phospholipids and sphingolipids were significantly perturbed during the early stages of infection and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage. These metabolites were associated with lymphocytes and platelets numbers, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers. The analysis revealed early anti-inflammatory responses working in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing the host from developing pathologies due to excessive or prolonged inflammation.

This study provides a detailed description of the metabolome changes in patients with acute dengue infection and offers a global molecular view of the underlying mechanisms of symptom manifestation. The findings may be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent decades, but significant gaps remain in diagnostic and treatment tools. To better understand German contributions to NTD research, a study analyzed bibliometric data from published research between 2002 and 2012. A SCOPUS database search identified 1,187 publications with at least one German author affiliation out of 26,833 worldwide publications on 11 diseases. The study extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-authorship networks.

The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, while collaborations with African countries were scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions, with strong performers identified on an individual level using classic and social network analysis parameters. The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases.

The study found that the share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand Germany's research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries. The study's findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
Haiti's Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) program has made significant progress in controlling lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000. A strong mass drug administration (MDA) program, led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and international partners, has achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, exceeding epidemiological targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The program's success can be attributed to key implementation strategies, including community awareness through multi-channel communication and education campaigns, community trust in voluntary drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment posts, and quality data collection.

These strategies have resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF. The program has also established a strong foundation for ongoing STH control. By leveraging sustained international financial and technical support, Haiti's MDA campaign has made steady progress toward LF elimination.

Research has shown that community knowledge and understanding of the disease, its transmission, and MDA strategy, as well as perceived risk of getting the disease, are positively associated with the likelihood of taking the offered treatment. However, in Haiti, knowledge of disease signs and symptoms was generally low and not strongly associated with participation in MDA. The program's success has also highlighted the importance of maintaining control of STH infections after the community-based LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring appropriate morbidity management for patients suffering from lymphatic filarial disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of the master regulator CtrA in controlling the cell cycle of Sinorhizobium meliloti, an alphaproteobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with specific legume hosts. This bacterium undergoes significant cellular differentiation within host root cells, resulting in genome amplification, cell branching and elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. Similar to Caulobacter crescentus, CtrA is thought to play a key role in regulating cellular differentiation in S. meliloti. However, the regulatory circuit driving cell cycle progression in S. meliloti is not well understood in both its free-living and symbiotic states.

The study found that depleting CtrA in S. meliloti leads to cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to what is observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The researchers also discovered that the cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism of CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, the study found that S. meliloti CtrA regulates similar processes as C. crescentus CtrA, but through different target genes. For example, S. meliloti CtrA negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system, unlike C. crescentus CtrA, which controls the expression of the Fts complex to regulate cell division.

These findings provide valuable insights into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria. The study's model of CtrA cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti will be crucial in understanding how the bacterial cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during the symbiosis.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. The bacterium's ability to multiply and survive within macrophages is crucial for its virulence. Researchers have identified a gene, FTL_0766, which encodes a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in F. tularensis. A mutant strain with a disrupted GGT gene showed impaired intracellular multiplication and reduced virulence in mice.

Further investigation revealed that the GGT activity of F. tularensis allows the bacterium to utilize glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine, an essential nutrient for intracellular growth. GSH is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol, and the bacterium's ability to utilize it as a cysteine source is a key adaptation to its intracellular environment.

Studies demonstrated that the F. tularensis GGT can cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond in γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide and GSH, releasing free cysteine. This process is essential for the bacterium's growth, as the ggt mutant, unable to cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond, requires the addition of free cysteine to compensate for its enzymatic deficiency. The results show that F. tularensis uses GSH and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as primary sources of cysteine, highlighting the importance of this nutrient acquisition system for the bacterium's intracellular multiplication and virulence.
Researchers studied how two types of Leishmania parasites, L. amazonensis and L. major, interact with each other inside host cells. Leishmania parasites alternate between two forms: flagellated promastigotes found in insect vectors and round-shaped amastigotes enclosed in phagolysosome-like Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PVs) of infected mammalian host cells. L. amazonensis amastigotes occupy large PVs, while L. major amastigotes lodge in small, tight PVs. To investigate if PVs of these Leishmania species can fuse with each other, researchers infected mouse macrophages with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected them with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. The study found that PVs containing L. major promastigotes fused with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs, but PVs containing L. amazonensis and L. major amastigotes did not fuse. In the fused PVs, L. major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, L. major promastigotes that remained in their own PVs differentiated into amastigotes. The study suggests that PVs, customized by L. major amastigotes or promastigotes, differ in their ability to fuse with L. amazonensis PVs, and that a species-specific PV is required for L. major destruction or differentiation.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in HIV-1 vaccine development by discovering that native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target quaternary epitopes. These epitopes take advantage of strain-specific holes in the glycan shield of the virus, allowing for broad neutralization of tier 2 isolates. The study found that two out of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers and one out of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost, developed unusually potent nAb titers. The neutralizing sera targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a putative "glycan fence" that limits access to this region. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that one of the trimer VLP sera shared features with monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with its trimer-dependency. The study also found that removing the N197 glycan rendered 50% of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the trimer VLP sera, showing broad neutralization via the surface masked by the N197 glycan. These findings provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine and suggest that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes.
Researchers have identified a set of markers that can be used to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcers (BU) treated with antibiotics. Traditionally, surgery has been the primary treatment for BU, but a combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin has improved treatment outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing extensive lesions after successful treatment has remained a challenge, particularly in rural areas where the disease is most prevalent.

Immunohistochemical investigations were conducted on tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions collected before, during, and after chemotherapy. The researchers analyzed the presence of markers associated with connective tissue neo-formation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation. The study found that α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts emerged during the healing process, producing extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin. These cells were found in fibronectin-rich areas and showed ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, indicating an activated phenotype.

The researchers also observed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermis. The study identified a set of markers, including αSMA, fibronectin, pro-collagen 1, tenascin-C, and CK16, that can be used to monitor wound healing in BU lesions. Additionally, the study suggests that the mTor pathway may play an important role in wound healing in BU. Further research is needed to investigate whether mTor pathway activation can help discriminate between healing and non-healing wounds in BU patients.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial transport in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo. Mitochondria play a crucial role in meeting the high energy demands of neurons, particularly in areas far from the cell body. To study this relationship, scientists used confocal imaging to observe mitochondrial movement and distribution in saphenous nerves of anaesthetized mice. Electrical and pharmacological stimulation of myelinated and unmyelinated axons revealed that low-frequency activity increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic compared to silent axons. Higher frequency conduction, within a physiological range of 50 Hz, significantly increased anterograde, but not retrograde, mitochondrial traffic by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Topical application of capsaicin to the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve also increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Additionally, stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency became shorter, suggesting enhanced fission and recruitment to the mobile population. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population did not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continued to travel anterogradely. These findings suggest that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction, and that increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may ensure a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load.
Researchers have identified a link between the loss of Filamin B (FLNB) and the development of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions. In a study using Flnb knockout mice, the researchers found that the intervertebral discs (IVDs) undergo rapid and progressive degeneration due to abnormal cell fate changes in the annulus fibrosus (AF). Specifically, AF cells lose their fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes, leading to endochondral-like ossification. This process is marked by changes in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of the disc tissue.

The researchers discovered that the conversion of AF cells into chondrocytes is associated with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP-induced p38 signaling, as well as sustained activation of canonical and non-canonical target genes p21 and Ctgf. These findings suggest that FLNB is involved in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influencing AF cell fate. The study also reveals that the IVD disruptions in Flnb knockout mice resemble aging degenerative discs, providing new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of FLNB in regulating TGFβ/BMP signaling and maintaining the integrity of the intervertebral discs.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the Thogoto virus (THOV) targets the host's antiviral response. The virus achieves this by interacting with a general transcription factor called TFIIB, which is essential for the recruitment of the polymerase complex to promoter start sites. This interaction leads to the depletion of TFIIB in the nucleus, impairing the de novo recruitment of the polymerase complex to certain genes. As a result, the expression of a limited number of genes is altered, including those involved in the innate immune response.

The study found that TFIIB is critical for the recruitment of the polymerase complex to promoter start sites, but not for regulated gene expression from paused promoters. Many immune genes require de novo recruitment of the polymerase complex, making TFIIB a key target for the virus. By targeting TFIIB, the virus can modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules without affecting general gene expression or cellular homeostasis.

This mechanism is beneficial for the virus, as it allows it to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while promoting the expression of negative regulators and tissue repair factors. The study suggests that targeting TFIIB may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. The findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between viruses and the host's antiviral response, and highlight the importance of TFIIB in regulating immune gene expression.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2-phase, characterized by 4N DNA content. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral DNA replication but is not necessary for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. A putative C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD2) within the NS1 protein is responsible for G2-phase arrest. The NS1 TAD2 domain activates the ATR-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. ATR activation phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216, inactivating the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting its nuclear import. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and ATR activation plays a crucial role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest. The NS1 TAD2 domain is essential for NS1-induced G2-phase arrest, as demonstrated by the use of doxycycline-inducible B19V-permissive UT7/Epo-S1 cell lines that express NS1 or NS1mTAD2. These results provide new insights into the mechanism underlying B19V NS1-induced G2-phase arrest and highlight the importance of the ATR-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway in this process.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases, from mild to life-threatening, characterized by vascular leakage and endothelial dysfunction. Previous research has shown that DENV's nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx layer, leading to increased vascular permeability. However, it was unclear whether this effect was due to the release of inflammatory cytokines or endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways.

   In this study, researchers investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways in DENV NS1-induced vascular leak. They found that DENV NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the skin of mice, but this effect is not due to the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. In fact, blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability.

   The researchers also found that DENV NS1 induces vascular leak in mice lacking the TLR4 receptor, which is involved in the immune response, and in mice lacking the TNF-α receptor. This suggests that DENV NS1's effect on vascular leak is independent of the immune response. Instead, the researchers found that DENV NS1-induced vascular leak is dependent on the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx components.

   These findings suggest that targeting enzymes involved in the degradation of glycocalyx components may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating severe dengue disease. The study highlights the importance of the endothelial glycocalyx in vascular leak and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of dengue virus.
In budding yeast, the integrity of the septin ring at the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The SPOC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis if the anaphase spindle does not properly align with the division axis. Two redundant ubiquitin-ligases, Dma1 and Dma2, play a key role in controlling septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of the Elm1 kinase to the bud neck. Elm1, in turn, regulates the Kin4 protein kinase, which is essential for the SPOC. Research has shown that cells lacking Dma1 and Dma2 (dma1Δ dma2Δ) exhibit reduced levels of Elm1 at the bud neck and impaired SPOC function. However, artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck in these cells is sufficient to restore a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response. This suggests a tight link between septin dynamics and SPOC function. The study proposes a model in which Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck. Elm1's activity stabilizes the septin ring and activates Kin4 through phosphorylation, which is counteracted by the PP2ARts1 phosphatase.
Researchers analyzed the human genome to identify genetic adaptations to climate-mediated selective pressures across 61 worldwide populations. They scanned the genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate variables. The study found a significant enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. This suggests that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of genetic variation in humans.

The researchers identified several SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases, as well as gene sets related to UV radiation, infection, and immunity, and cancer. These findings are consistent with the idea that climate influences the distribution of human pathogens. The study also found that genes and variants implicated in pigmentation and response to UV radiation, immune response, autoimmune disease, and cancer are among those with the strongest signals of selection.

A subset of SNPs with extremely large Bayes factors for climate variables were also strongly associated with traits based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These SNPs are implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune disease. The researchers used the same allele frequency data to test for adaptations to continuous climate variables at the genome-wide level and identified genetic loci that underlie these adaptations. The study found a significant enrichment of genic SNPs with strong correlations with climate relative to non-genic SNPs in all population subsets.
Researchers have investigated the effects of a specific genetic mutation, N588K, associated with short QT syndrome (SQTS) on the heart's electrical activity. SQTS is a condition characterized by a shortened QT interval, which can lead to an increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. The study used computer models to simulate the effects of the N588K mutation on the heart's electrical activity. The results showed that the mutation led to a shortened QT interval and increased the risk of re-entrant excitation waves, which can cause arrhythmias.

The researchers used two types of computer models to simulate the effects of the mutation: Hodgkin-Huxley and Markov chain models. The Markov chain models were found to be more accurate in reproducing the effects of the mutation on the heart's electrical activity. The models were then used to simulate the effects of the mutation on the heart's electrical activity in different parts of the heart, including the ventricle.

The results showed that the N588K mutation led to a shortened QT interval and increased the risk of re-entrant excitation waves in some areas of the ventricle. This increased the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. The study also found that the mutation facilitated the initiation and maintenance of re-entrant excitation waves, making it easier for arrhythmias to occur. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying SQTS and the increased risk of arrhythmias associated with the N588K mutation.
Researchers have developed a new model using deep attention networks to understand the collective motion of zebrafish. This model is able to predict the motion of individual fish in a group while also providing insight into the underlying rules governing their behavior. The model is organized in modules, which allows it to balance complexity and predictability. When tested on simulated trajectories, the model was able to recover the ground-truth interaction rule used to generate them, as well as the number of interacting neighbors. When applied to experimental data from groups of 60-100 zebrafish, the model found that interactions between pairs of fish can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The model also showed that each fish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average of its neighbors, with weights higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. Additionally, the model found that the number of interacting individuals is dynamic and typically in the range of 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones. These results suggest that each fish makes decisions by dynamically selecting information from the collective.
Researchers used a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness cost of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The study aimed to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution, which is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. The researchers analyzed viral sequence data from ART-naive patients to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages and model the transmission tree using stochastic birth-death-sampling processes.

The study focused on eight major resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. The results showed that the 90M mutation in the protease gene had a significantly higher fitness than the drug-sensitive strains, while the 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were less fit than the sensitive strains. The remaining resistance mutations did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort.

The researchers developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations. This approach can be useful in assessing the risk of transmitted drug resistance in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data are missing. The study's findings highlight the importance of understanding the transmission fitness of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations to inform global HIV-containment programs, such as test-and-treat strategies.
Researchers have found that the Elongator complex, which includes the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, plays a crucial role in the modification of certain transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in fission yeast. This modification is essential for the efficient translation of stress-induced mRNAs, particularly those containing a high number of lysine-coding codons. The study shows that cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 are sensitive to oxidative stress due to their inability to modify the wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs, specifically tRNALysUUU, tRNAGlnUUU, and tRNAGluUUU. This modification, known as mcm5s2U34, is necessary for the proper translation of highly expressed mRNAs, including those coding for the transcription factors Atf1 and Pcr1, which are involved in the stress response.

The researchers found that cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 or other tRNA modifying activities, such as Ctu1-Ctu2, are unable to efficiently translate these stress-induced mRNAs, leading to impaired stress tolerance. However, overexpression of tRNALysUUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells, suggesting that the lack of this tRNA modification is the primary cause of their sensitivity to oxidative stress. The study also shows that the transcriptional defects observed in Elongator mutant cells are likely a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of the transcription factor Atf1-Pcr1 and other components of the transcriptional machinery. These findings highlight the importance of tRNA modification in the regulation of translation and stress response in fission yeast.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the Nef protein in HIV-1, which makes the virus resistant to certain neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, target the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the Env protein on the surface of the virus. The study found that Nef increases the resistance of HIV-1 to these antibodies by up to 50-fold. This effect is specific to 2F5 and 4E10, as Nef does not affect the virus's sensitivity to other neutralizing antibodies that target different parts of the Env protein.

The researchers tested Nef from different HIV-1 and SIV isolates and found that it conferred resistance to 2F5 and 4E10 in all cases. They also found that a glycosylated form of the Gag protein from a different virus, MoMLV, could substitute for Nef in conferring resistance to these antibodies. This suggests that the ability of Nef to make the virus resistant to 2F5 and 4E10 is a conserved feature of lentiviruses.

The study also found that Nef decreases the efficiency of virion capture by 2F5 and 4E10, but not by other neutralizing antibodies. This is consistent with a model in which Nef alters the recognition of the MPER by 2F5 and 4E10 in the context of the virion membrane. The discovery of this new function of Nef has important implications for understanding anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
Researchers have investigated the molecular interactions between the snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, and the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. The study used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to compare gene expression profiles between uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos. The analysis revealed 7,655 differentially expressed genes, associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including those involved in immune defense mechanisms against parasites. The study found that genes encoding proteases were down-regulated in infected snails, while genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins were up-regulated. This suggests that O. viverrini may suppress the snail's immune response, allowing the parasite to successfully colonize its host. The study provides a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the snail-parasite interaction and may lead to a better understanding of the susceptibility and resistance of B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini. The annotated dataset generated in this study is a valuable resource for future research on snail-parasite interactions and may aid in the discovery of molecular pathways involved in the development of CCA.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They analyzed CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study involving 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls. The study found that individuals with a specific recombinant haplotype, which includes the rs3849266*T and rs3737002*T variants, had twice the susceptibility to leprosy compared to those without this haplotype. This haplotype was also associated with lower levels of soluble CR1 in paucibacillary patients, which may reduce the anti-inflammatory response. Additionally, the study found that the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form of leprosy and was associated with higher gene expression of CR1. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between soluble CR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin, a molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement. The results suggest that CR1 polymorphisms play a regulatory role in mRNA and soluble CR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects that increase susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. This study is the first to specifically analyze the influence of CR1 haplotypes, mRNA expression, and soluble CR1 levels in leprosy susceptibility.
Researchers used a large population-based cohort to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determinants. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals and found significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus for glycine, indicating that specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism.

A combined meta-analysis of two cohorts revealed 113 metabolites with a significant effect of sex. The researchers also investigated how groups of metabolites share pairwise correlations and how sex-specific effects propagate through the metabolic network. They found that sex-stratified genome-wide association analysis adjusted for age and BMI revealed significant effects of gender in 102 of 131 metabolites.

The study provides new insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in the design and interpretation of studies. The findings shed light on biochemical mechanisms that might explain observed differences in susceptibility and time course of common diseases in males and females. This research highlights the need to consider sex-specific differences in the study of complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.
Researchers have developed genome-scale metabolic networks to model genotype-phenotype relationships in cells. These models use optimization algorithms to predict the active metabolic state under specific conditions. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is very large, making optimization necessary. The objective function used in these algorithms is crucial for successful modeling, as it is directly linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model.

Current methods use a linear combination of selected fluxes to formulate metabolic objective functions, but this approach is sensitive to the stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. This sensitivity leads to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations, making biological interpretation subjective and ambiguous.

To address this issue, researchers propose a new method called Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). This method decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, the researchers demonstrate that using stoichiometry representation-independent algorithms is essential for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation.

The MiMBl method allows for the expansion of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The researchers illustrate the need for rethinking the problem formulation for metabolic modeling by showing how current methods lead to incoherent biological predictions when representing reaction stoichiometry differently.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague, a highly virulent disease caused by Yersinia pestis, and the population genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus) in Madagascar. The study aimed to determine whether topographic relief influences the spread of plague within the Madagascan focus. The researchers conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas with different topographic relief profiles. The results showed that rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief, as expected. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not solely related to the effective dispersal of rats. Genetic diversity estimates indicated that plague epizootics had a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be explained solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir, suggesting that human social activities may also play a role in spreading the disease in rat and human populations. The study found significant but weak genotypic differentiation of R. rattus subpopulations over a relatively small spatial scale. The results suggest that plague spread in rat and human populations can be partly related to the population genetic structure of the reservoir, but also to human social activities.
Researchers have identified a family of proteins called Ly6 on the surface of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which is responsible for causing schistosomiasis in humans. These proteins, known as SmLy6A, SmLy6B, and SmLy6D, are anchored to the parasite's surface and play a crucial role in its ability to live inside the human body for a long time. Previous studies have shown that two of these proteins, SmLy6B and SmLy6D, can induce protective immunity in mice, and one of them, SmLy6D, is recognized by the human immune system during infection. However, the immune response to these proteins in humans has not been thoroughly explored.

A new study has reanalyzed the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family and identified 11 members, including three new proteins. The researchers found that all of these proteins are likely to be bound to the parasite's surface and are therefore accessible to the immune system. To investigate the immune response to these proteins in humans, the researchers measured the levels of IgG1 antibodies against two surface-bound representatives, SmLy6A and SmLy6B, in a cohort of Schistosoma mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after treatment with the antiparasitic drug praziquantel. The results showed that the levels of IgG1 antibodies against SmLy6A and SmLy6B dropped significantly after treatment, while the levels of antibodies against a sub-surface antigen, SmTAL1, increased. These findings suggest that the surface-associated SmLy6A and SmLy6B proteins elicit an immune response during infection in endemic communities.
Researchers have developed a computer simulation to study how cells in the Drosophila retina form their characteristic shapes during tissue development. The simulation focuses on the role of N-cadherin, a protein that helps cells stick together. The model takes into account the timing of N-cadherin expression in cells and its relationship to changes in cell-cell contacts. The simulation accurately reproduces the shapes of normal and mutant cells that lack or misexpress N-cadherin. It also highlights the importance of N-cadherin biogenesis and its timing in relation to cell remodeling. Furthermore, the model suggests that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, affecting the strength of adhesion between cells. The study demonstrates that N-cadherin plays a crucial role in determining the geometric shapes of cells in the Drosophila retina, going beyond its previously known function in cell sorting. The model incorporates dynamic features of morphogenesis, such as the temporal sequence of cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling, without requiring additional free parameters. The researchers tested the model by comparing it to experimental data from mutants with altered N-cadherin levels and found a good fit. The study provides new insights into how cadherin molecules control cell geometry and highlights the importance of considering the distribution and dynamic properties of cadherins in understanding tissue development.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of MT1-MMP in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion. MT1-MMP is a potent protease that localizes to invadopodia and plays a central role in ECM degradation. Previous studies suggested that a continuous supply of MT1-MMP is necessary for ECM degradation, but the rate of MT1-MMP turnover and its contribution to ECM degradation were unclear. To address this, the researchers used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to measure the rate of MT1-MMP turnover at invadopodia. They found that MT1-MMP is rapidly turned over, with two distinct time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds, primarily due to vesicle transport rather than lateral diffusion. The researchers then constructed a computational model based on these findings and used it to simulate ECM degradation. The model successfully replicated the FRAP experiments and predicted that inhibiting vesicle transport would block ECM degradation. Experiments confirmed this prediction, showing that blocking vesicle transport reduced ECM degradation. The researchers also found that the degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT1-MMP turnover. Furthermore, the model suggested that both proteolytic activity and MT1-MMP turnover contribute synergistically to ECM degradation, with a nonlinear reduction in ECM degradation when both factors are reduced simultaneously. This computational model provides a new tool for designing and evaluating intervention strategies to inhibit cancer cell invasion.
Researchers studied how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) evolves and becomes resistant to drugs within an infected individual. They used a simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model, which closely mimics HIV-1, to investigate this process. Four macaques were infected with SHIV and treated with a single drug to induce the emergence of drug-resistant mutations. The researchers collected virus samples from the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at multiple time points and analyzed the genetic sequences of the virus.

The study found that the virus rapidly acquired drug resistance across different compartments of the body, including the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina, through multiple independent mutations. The researchers observed that the virus in the blood and lymph nodes was rarely compartmentalized, meaning it was not significantly different from the virus in other parts of the body. However, the virus in the gut had a faster turnover rate and retained fewer wild-type viruses compared to other compartments.

The study suggests that even frequently sampled blood may not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, particularly the gut. The findings may help explain the varied results of previous studies on compartmentalization in HIV-1. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the genetic variation of the virus across the body when reconstructing transmission chains and tracking transmitted drug resistance. This research may contribute to our understanding of viral reservoirs and the potential for virus eradication.
Researchers used mathematical modeling to investigate the role of feedback regulation in tissue morphogenesis. They found that a specific type of feedback, where both positive and negative diffusible signals act on stem and/or progenitor cells, can lead to unique growth behaviors. These behaviors include bistable or bi-modal growth, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and the triggering of self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. This occurs through the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal, rather than the regulation of cell cycle speeds. The spatial patterns that arise in this setting are the result of interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not the consequence of Turing-type instabilities. The study suggests that feedback regulation of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to growth bistability or bimodality, with ultrasensitive switching between high and low (or zero) growth states. This phenomenon is supported by several in vivo reports of growth bistability/bimodality, feedback ultrasensitivity, and feedback-regulated morphogenesis. The researchers mathematically defined the conditions required for underlying phenomena such as bistability, ultrasensitivity, and spatial self-organization to arise in such systems, and showed how they can drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers, which are the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness due to excessive eye elongation. The study analyzed data from 45,771 European participants and identified 22 significant genetic associations with the age of myopia onset. Ten of these associations were novel and replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 individuals. These findings explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset and suggest multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of myopia.

The study's results point to several mechanisms underlying myopia development, including extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina. One association was found in the PRSS56 gene, previously linked to abnormally small eyes, while another was in the LAMA2 gene, which forms part of the extracellular matrix. Two associations were near genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, and two were near genes involved in the growth and guidance of retinal ganglion cells. Five associations were in or near genes involved in neuronal signaling or development.

The study's findings differ from previous genome-wide association studies that focused on refractive error, suggesting that some genetic factors may affect myopia age of onset independently of its severity. The results also highlight the importance of considering the age of onset when studying myopia, as adult-onset myopia tends to be less severe than myopia developed in childhood or adolescence. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic factors contributing to myopia development and suggests complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina.
Researchers investigated the role of body curvature feedback in the swimming behavior of lampreys using a closed-loop model. The model simulated the lamprey's central pattern generator (CPG) circuit, which activates muscles for locomotion and adjusts activity in response to sensory inputs from the environment. The CPG was modeled as a chain of coupled oscillators, with pairs of phase oscillators representing the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. The emergent curvature of the body served as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback were considered: directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on the sign of a gain parameter, and magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. The results showed that directional feedback did not affect beat frequency but changed the duration of muscle activity, while magnitude feedback increased beat frequency and reduced the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain was high and positive. The body curvature had a similar magnitude with both types of feedback, indicating that different functional forms of curvature-based feedback can cause distinct differences in swimming performance. This study provides new insights into the role of sensory feedback in the swimming behavior of lampreys and has implications for understanding the neural control of locomotion in other animals.
Researchers studied how different strains of the HIV virus compete for dominance in a population. They found that the first strain to colonize a population has a significant advantage over subsequent strains. This "first comer advantage" slows down the spread of new strains and limits the diversification of the epidemic. The study used computer simulations to model the spread of HIV over a dynamic network of sexual contacts. The simulations showed that the second strain was unable to invade the population on a time scale relevant to the history of the HIV pandemic, unless it had a significant advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. In fact, the second strain needed to be at least 25% more transmissible than the first strain to become dominant over a period of decades. The study also found that the inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. The researchers tested various mechanisms that could contribute to the inhibition effect, including the inhibition of superinfection, the depletion of highly connected individuals in the network, and a one-time peak of infectiousness. The study's findings suggest that the global phylogeography of HIV, which is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics dominated by a single subtype, can be explained by the first comer advantage. The study's results may also have implications for the future evolution of the pandemic.
Researchers have investigated the self-organization of muscle cell structure and function, focusing on how muscle cells adapt to their environment to form a functional contractile apparatus. They developed a computational model to study how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes in response to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. The model revealed that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as the cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. These findings suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton. A positive feedback loop, potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions, is required to initiate the break in symmetry and polarize the contractile cytoskeleton. The researchers also found that the contractility of a cell plays a crucial role in polarizing the myofibrillar network, and that muscle cells depend on extracellular spatial cues to efficiently and functionally organize the myofibrils and contraction. The study provides insights into the multiscale coupling problem of muscle organization, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle, and highlights the importance of extracellular boundary conditions in regulating muscle cell structure and function.
Researchers have been exploring the use of the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To assess the invasive potential of Wolbachia in urban environments, a study examined the effects of different urban landscapes on the spread of the wMel strain of Wolbachia in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Laboratory experiments showed that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and has no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted in two areas where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future, and mathematical models were used to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood of Wolbachia infection frequency reaching 100%. The results suggest that the wMel strain will likely successfully invade five distinct field sites around Rio de Janeiro, with local mosquito abundance being the most important factor influencing the spread of Wolbachia. The study's findings provide a framework for the ongoing field releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti in Brazil and will be useful for future releases in other urban landscapes. The results also highlight the importance of characterizing field sites prior to Wolbachia release to determine the optimal release strategy. Overall, the study demonstrates that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses the three forms of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) in rice. This epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, particularly in plant development and stress adaptation. The study found that JMJ703 is essential for stem elongation and plant growth in rice, and its loss-of-function mutation leads to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes.

The researchers analyzed the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of JMJ703 and found that it shares similarities with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins, which are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of JMJ703, including key residues that interact with cofactors and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide. These residues are essential for the demethylase activity in vivo and are conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation.

The study also found that JMJ703 specifically demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 in vivo and in vitro, implying that it is important for rice gene expression. The researchers suggest that JMJ703 may regulate growth hormone metabolism in rice, which is different from its function in Arabidopsis, where it is involved in floral transition, DNA methylation, and RNA silencing. Overall, the study provides new insights into the structural basis of a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase required for stem elongation in rice.
Researchers have identified a shared binding site in the HIV-1 capsid that is targeted by multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands. However, previous studies have only examined the capsid in its monomeric form, limiting understanding of how these ligands influence infection. A new study reveals that this binding site is part of a larger protein-protein interface that only exists in the context of hexameric CA, a form of the capsid that consists of six monomers. This interface is essential for binding to cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, as well as the antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. The study found that each ligand binds to a shared phenylalanine-glycine motif in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, and also interacts with a second monomer through the N-terminal domain: C-terminal domain interface. Dissociation of the hexamer into monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with CPSF6 and PF74, and abolishes binding to NUP153. The study also found that NUP153 and CPSF6 have overlapping binding sites, but each makes unique interactions with the capsid. Mutations that selectively disrupt these interactions can alter the dependency of the virus on these cofactors. Overall, the study reveals that multiple ligands share an overlapping interface in the HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly, providing new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have improved the genome assembly of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a major vector of human arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. The Aedes aegypti genome is the largest among sequenced mosquito genomes, consisting of 4,758 scaffolds, many of which have not been assigned to a chromosome. By scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Aedes aegypti, the researchers generated a genetic map that revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome assembly. These misassemblies resulted in sequences from different chromosomes being placed on the same scaffold. After correcting these errors, the researchers were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome.

The new genome assembly revealed large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend up to 47% of the chromosome. To demonstrate the utility of the new genome assembly, the researchers mapped a gene that makes Aedes aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi and identified candidate genes that could be affecting the trait. This improved genome assembly will facilitate the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission in Aedes aegypti, a crucial step in understanding and controlling the spread of arboviruses.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a major target of vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional household larval surveys are still widely used despite the availability of new trapping devices. A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities in Brazil to compare the effectiveness of four types of traps (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps) with traditional larval surveys. The study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of these traps in detecting mosquito density variations.

The results showed that the House Index, a traditional measure of mosquito infestation, was consistently low in most cities. In contrast, the traps rarely produced null indices, indicating their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Aedes aegypti. The trap positivity indices tended to plateau at high mosquito densities, but both indices agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variations.

The study found that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should consider differences in cost and ease of use. The results suggest that traps can be valuable tools in combination with vector control strategies to improve responses to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti.
APOBEC3G (A3G), a human protein, is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses, including HIV-1, by deaminating cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. A3G contains two cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal one known to mediate cytidine deamination. Researchers used the crystal structure of the related tetrameric APOBEC2 (A2) protein to identify residues in A3G that facilitate oligomerization. They found that tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 in the N-terminal CDA domain mediate A3G oligomerization, which coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. A homology model of A3G onto the A2 template structure revealed a positively charged pocket that is essential for oligomerization, packaging, and antiviral function. Substitution of arginine residues in this pocket reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. Furthermore, oligomerization-deficient A3G proteins associated less efficiently with cellular RNA molecules, suggesting that RNA occupation of the positively charged pocket promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging, and antiviral function. These findings provide new insights into the structure-function organization of APOBEC proteins and highlight the importance of RNA-dependent oligomerization in A3G's antiviral activity.
Researchers have long sought to understand the genetic basis of complex traits that vary in a quantitative manner, such as those found in agriculture, evolution, and medicine. However, identifying the genes and sequence variants responsible for this variation has been challenging due to biological and technical complexities. A study in Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species, has made significant progress in this area by dissecting the effects of multiple causative variants within a single locus. The researchers focused on the bric-a-brac (bab) locus, which plays a crucial role in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries. They sequenced the bab genomic region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster and found that natural alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation result from a cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression confirmed that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. This study demonstrates that a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) can act through multiple molecular mechanisms and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. These findings have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and have potential applications in basic and medical genomics.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a persistent cause of disease in humans, despite the use of antibiotics and vaccines. The bacterium's ability to adapt to its environment is due in part to its capacity for genetic exchange with other microorganisms. This exchange is controlled by a quorum sensing system that is triggered by the extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP). Researchers have found that CSP also stimulates the production of a diverse array of bacteriocins, which are proteins that kill or inhibit the growth of other bacteria. This cross-stimulation occurs through the increased production and secretion of the bacteriocin pheromone BlpC, which requires a functional competence regulatory system. A highly conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlpC and its transporter mediates the upregulation by CSP. The accumulation of BlpC following CSP stimulation results in the activation of the entire blp locus. In biofilm-grown organisms, which are a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion. This suggests that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The blp and com regulatory pathways, which control competence and bacteriocin production, respectively, have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation by targeting a wide array of potential competitors while providing the means for incorporation of their DNA.
Researchers have investigated the role of cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 in the translation of poliovirus RNA. The study found that SRp20 re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells during poliovirus infection, where it partially co-localizes with PCBP2. This interaction between SRp20 and PCBP2 is crucial for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA, allowing for the initiation of translation. The researchers demonstrated that SRp20 is associated with PCBP2 bound to poliovirus RNA in infected cells, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. A mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SRp20ΔRRM) was found to be localized similarly to the full-length SRp20 and partially co-localized with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection. However, expression of this mutated protein resulted in a significant decrease in virus yield for poliovirus, suggesting that SRp20 plays a critical role in poliovirus infection. The study provides new evidence for the importance of the PCBP2-SRp20 interaction in intact cells during poliovirus infection and suggests a model by which PCBP2, bound to the viral RNA, interacts with SRp20 to recruit the translation initiation complex to the viral RNA. This research contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of ribosome recruitment for picornavirus IRES-mediated translation initiation and highlights the significance of non-canonical factors in bridging the translation machinery to the RNA.
Researchers conducted an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify genes involved in neural crest (NC) development. The NC is a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including neurons, glial cells, and melanocytes. Mutations in genes regulating NC development can lead to neurocristopathies, a group of developmental disorders. The researchers used a mouse model, Sox10LacZ/+, which is sensitive to NC defects, to identify genetic pathways involved in NC development. They analyzed 71 pedigrees and identified four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1-4 (msp1-4), which show altered NC patterning. One of these loci, msp1, was found to be a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, which carries a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. The mutation does not affect protein expression but impairs ERBB3 signaling, leading to embryonic defects similar to those of Erbb3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis showed that the mutant protein is expressed on the cell surface but has reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation. This study highlights the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation, and demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC development. The findings contribute to a better understanding of gene function in a cellular and developmental setting.
Researchers conducted a study in a rural Ugandan fishing community to investigate factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection. The study aimed to understand how age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE immune responses affect susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment. The researchers used individual-level cercarial exposure scores to account for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities in the community.

The study found that ethnic and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to differences in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, but were linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 immune responses to the schistosome antigen SmTAL1. This balance was significantly related to resistance to reinfection.

The study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and make more robust conclusions. The findings suggest that IgE and IgG4 immune responses play a crucial role in determining susceptibility to S. mansoni reinfection, particularly in older individuals. The study's use of individual-level cercarial exposure scores allowed researchers to account for the complex patterns of exposure observed in the community, providing a more accurate understanding of the factors influencing S. mansoni infection. The results have implications for the development of targeted interventions to control schistosomiasis in endemic communities.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) and the actual number of worms in individuals infected with Clonorchis sinensis, a type of liver fluke parasite. The study involved 60 residents from Sancheong-gun, Korea, who were diagnosed with clonorchiasis through egg positivity in their feces using the Kato-Katz method. After treatment with praziquantel, the participants were given a purgation solution to induce bowel movements, and adult worms were collected from their feces. The results showed a positive correlation between EPGs and the number of worms, with a correlation coefficient of 0.681 (P<0.001). The study found that worm recovery rates were higher in individuals with higher EPGs, with 73.7% of those with EPGs over 1,000 recovering worms, compared to 9.7% of those with EPGs between 1-1,000. The study also estimated that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with EPGs around 3,000, and that each worm produces approximately 4,000 eggs per day. These findings suggest that the number of eggs per gram of feces is a reliable indicator of the worm burden in clonorchiasis, and that praziquantel treatment followed by purgation is a safe and effective method for collecting adult worms from infected individuals.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat the growing problem of anti-fungal drug resistance. They used an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify potential targets for combination therapies in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study focused on Candida glabrata, a human fungal pathogen that often develops resistance to fluconazole, a commonly used antifungal medication. By expressing a gain-of-function allele of the PDR1 gene in S. cerevisiae, the researchers identified 18 synthetically lethal genetic mutants. One of these mutants, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was further investigated. The study found that deleting or inhibiting Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles, and also inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. This suggests that targeting Gcn5, a synthetically lethal interacting partner of PDR1L280F, could be a new approach to treating drug-resistant infections. The researchers confirmed that this interaction is conserved in C. glabrata and demonstrated that chemically inhibiting Gcn5 renders both S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata mutants inviable. This proof-of-concept study shows that identifying synthetic lethal genetic interactions with alleles that confer antifungal drug resistance can be a valuable approach to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
Researchers have investigated the formation of membranous structures in cells infected with poliovirus (PV). These structures, which contain phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), are thought to play a crucial role in PV replication and assembly. The study used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which exhibit delayed genome replication and impaired virus assembly, to understand the pathway of formation of PV-induced membranous structures. The results show that changes to the PI4P pool occur as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of a replication inhibitor, and are accompanied by the formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appear in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection, which is too slow to be responsible for genome replication. The study suggests that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters). The pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that PI4P serves as a marker of the genome-replication organelle. The results also suggest that the GG PV mutant is unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters, which may explain the nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus produced by this mutant.
Researchers have identified a new class of non-peptidic cruzain inhibitors with trypanocidal activity against Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. A multi-step approach combining virtual screening and in vitro assays led to the discovery of 12 non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with low micromolar affinity values. One of these inhibitors, Nequimed176, was confirmed to bind to cruzain through X-ray crystallography. Cruzain is a validated therapeutic target for Chagas disease and shares similarities with the mammalian enzyme cathepsin L, which is associated with invasive properties and metastatic cancer cells. The cruzain inhibitors were also tested against cathepsin L, showing similar affinity values but poor selectivity towards cruzain. Two compounds were found to have trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi-infected cells. The most potent inhibitor, Nequimed42, was used to establish a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study, which identified the 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide group as essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition activities. The IC50 value for Nequimed42 against the trypomastigote form of the Tulahuen lacZ strain was found to be 10.6±0.1 µM, tenfold lower than the positive control benznidazole. A smaller compound derived from Nequimed42, Nequimed176, was identified as a novel non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor with a ligand efficiency of 0.33 kcal mol−1 atom−1, making it a promising candidate for optimization as a trypanocidal agent.
Researchers have developed two DNA-based vaccine formulations against yellow fever (YF) virus, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions. The existing attenuated YF virus vaccine provides long-lasting protection but can have rare, potentially fatal side effects. The new DNA vaccines encode the full-length envelope protein of the YF virus, either alone or fused to a lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal. These formulations were tested in mice and compared to the standard YF 17DD vaccine. The results showed that both DNA vaccines induced strong T-cell responses against nearly all epitopes generated by the YF 17DD vaccine, with the fused protein formulation (pL/YFE) performing best. Additionally, the pL/YFE vaccine stimulated high levels of neutralizing antibodies, comparable to those elicited by the 17DD vaccine. Importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine provided 100% protection against a lethal YF virus challenge in mice. These findings suggest that the pL/YFE DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for further development. The study expands the epitope mapping for the YF virus envelope protein and demonstrates the potential of DNA-based vaccines to provide effective protection against YF virus infection.
Researchers have identified a new role for the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. This protein, previously known for its involvement in cell division, is also a direct activator of the chitobiose utilization genes in V. cholerae. Chitobiose is a disaccharide derived from chitin, a key component of the marine environment where V. cholerae resides. The ability to utilize chitobiose is essential for the persistence and evolution of V. cholerae in its natural habitat.

The chitobiose utilization genes are encoded by the chb operon, which is regulated by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. However, the mechanisms downstream of ChiS activation that result in the expression of the chb operon were not well understood. An unbiased transposon mutant screen revealed that SlmA is a regulator of the chb operon. In vitro experiments showed that SlmA binds directly to the promoter region of the chb operon, and in vivo experiments confirmed that this interaction is necessary for the transcriptional activation of the chb operon and chitobiose utilization.

Interestingly, SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are generally transcriptional repressors. However, in this case, SlmA acts as a transcriptional activator. The study found that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for the transcriptional activation of the chb operon by SlmA. This discovery highlights a novel role for SlmA in V. cholerae, in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.
Researchers have developed a new framework for solving complex mathematical problems that arise when modeling dynamic biological systems. These systems, such as microbial communities, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways, are challenging to model due to their nonlinearity and stiffness. The new framework uses advanced computational tools to efficiently solve parameter estimation problems, which are essential for validating models against experimental data.

The framework employs a time-discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations, enables algebraic model implementations, and utilizes efficient nonlinear solvers. This approach allows for the solution of large-scale parameter estimation problems in a matter of minutes, whereas traditional methods can take hours or even days. The researchers demonstrated the framework's capabilities by solving a problem with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 data points in under 3 minutes.

The proposed framework is flexible, easy to use, and can be applied to various dynamic models of biological systems. It also enables the implementation of advanced techniques for quantifying parameter uncertainty, diagnosing model issues, and handling outliers. The framework's high computational efficiency makes it suitable for modeling complex biological systems, such as high-dimensional microbial communities and whole-cell models. By providing a scalable and robust solution to parameter estimation problems, the new framework has the potential to accelerate the development of accurate and reliable models of biological systems.
Researchers used a high-throughput digital gene expression system called nCounter to study the inflammatory response in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV). The study aimed to understand how WNV spreads and triggers an immune response in the body. The researchers infected outbred Swiss Webster mice with WNV and analyzed gene expression changes in multiple tissues, including the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain, over a nine-day period. They used a multiplex protein detection system to confirm the expression levels of certain cytokine and chemokine genes.

The results showed that certain genes, such as Cxcl10 and Il12b, were differentially expressed in all tissues except the kidney. By comparing infected and non-infected tissues, the researchers were able to distinguish between the general inflammatory response to WNV and tissue-specific responses. They found that some genes, like C3ar1, were down-regulated in non-infected spleen tissues, while others, like Il23a, were up-regulated in non-infected lung tissues.

In infected tissues, the researchers observed significant up-regulation of genes involved in the immune response, such as Stat1, Tlr2, and chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, and Cxcl9. The study demonstrated the utility of the nCounter platform for rapidly identifying gene expression changes associated with WNV infection in mice. The findings provide valuable insights into the inflammatory response to WNV and highlight the potential of high-throughput gene expression analysis for understanding viral pathogenesis.
In 2014, an outbreak of human rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities in Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites. The study reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites from April to July 2014 and conducted a community investigation in July and August in the neighborhoods where cases of human rabies resided. Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite, and 819 cases of animal bites were registered, with dogs responsible for 97.8% of all bites. Factors significantly associated with human rabies were age under 15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. The study found that implementation of control measures for rabies is poor in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures. The findings of this study contribute to formulating appropriate recommendations and strategies to control rabies in Mozambique. The study highlights the need for improved implementation of control measures, including vaccination of dogs and post-exposure prophylaxis, to prevent the spread of rabies in the region.
Researchers have identified a new gene, SCN9A, associated with febrile seizures (FS) in a large Utah family. The gene encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel, and a mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641Y, was found in 21 affected family members. This mutation was not present in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, the researchers introduced the orthologous mutation into mice using targeted homologous recombination. The resulting mice exhibited reduced thresholds to electrically induced seizures and increased susceptibility to kindling acquisition. These findings support the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation as a cause of FS in this family.

Further analysis of 92 unrelated FS patients revealed additional highly conserved Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. One child with FS later developed Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy, and was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the SCN1A gene. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients identified nine Nav1.7 missense variants, all in highly conserved amino acids. Six of these patients had both SCN9A and SCN1A mutations, while three had only SCN9A mutations. These findings suggest that SCN9A plays a role in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations in Dravet syndrome. The study provides evidence for the involvement of SCN9A in central excitability and seizure susceptibility.
Researchers have developed a new framework, called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth. This framework focuses on the role of molecular signalling, or polarity, in specifying growth orientations, rather than relying on tissue stresses. In the GPT framework, tissue is treated as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors interact and propagate to establish polarity. Polarity is anchored in specific regions, called tissue polarity organisers, which are under genetic control. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth is influenced by the interaction of specified growth patterns within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature. This framework allows for the generation of complex shapes from simple rules and can account for asymmetries through interactions between polarity fields. The GPT framework was applied to a growing Snapdragon flower, demonstrating its value in understanding morphogenesis. The study highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions between tissue polarity and growth rates in generating a wide range of biological shapes. The framework provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how complex tissue shapes arise through growth and offers a new perspective on the role of polarity in morphogenesis.
Researchers investigated the impact of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. During early HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus's genome. This leads to the selection of mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies have shown that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they fixate in the population. This pattern, known as the pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD), can arise through distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains.

The researchers developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination to investigate how interference between concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes. They also derived an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. The results showed that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. The number of loci and recombination rates were found to significantly affect ERD, which can be explained by the underexponential decline of escape rates over time.

The study also found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects. The results confirm that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations. However, estimating escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients under interference regimes is challenging due to the stochastic nature of competition between mutations, requiring novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains rather than mutation frequencies.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The model estimates the cell-killing ability of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens, which combine cisplatin with other drugs such as gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel. The model takes into account various factors that influence treatment outcome, including tumor growth rate, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance.

The model was applied to data from 13 NSCLC patients who received cisplatin-based doublet regimens in the neoadjuvant context. The researchers used a sensitivity analysis to identify key factors that affect the accuracy of the model's predictions, including tumor volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis. The model was able to estimate the cell-killing ability of the various chemotherapy regimens, providing a quantitative framework for personalized treatment predictions.

The study's findings suggest that the model can be used to estimate the in-vivo cell-killing ability of chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. Correlating these estimates with molecular profiles of patients could lead to more reliable personalized treatment predictions. The model's ability to account for tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation makes it a valuable tool for predicting treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism behind the high tolerance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics, specifically the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are notoriously difficult to treat with antibiotics due to their complex structure and physiological heterogeneity. In this study, scientists used random transposon mutagenesis to identify mutants of Escherichia coli that formed biofilms with increased tolerance to ofloxacin. They found that starved biofilms exhibited significantly greater tolerance to ofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts.

The researchers discovered that the biofilm-associated tolerance to ofloxacin was fully dependent on a functional SOS response, which is a cellular response to DNA damage, and partially dependent on the stringent response, a response to amino acid starvation. However, this tolerance did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems previously associated with the formation of highly tolerant persisters.

The study also found that ofloxacin tolerance was induced as a function of biofilm age, which was dependent on the SOS response. This suggests that the SOS stress response, induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments, is a key molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to ofloxacin. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in biofilms and highlight the importance of the SOS response in mediating this tolerance.
Researchers have identified cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a key regulator in the invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the parasites responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. The invasion process involves specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. The study found that exposure to a low potassium environment, similar to that found in blood plasma, triggers the activation of a bicarbonate-sensitive adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cAMP levels and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA regulates the secretion of microneme proteins, which are essential for receptor engagement and invasion.

The researchers also discovered that cAMP regulates the levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the merozoite cytosol through an Epac pathway, and that increases in both cAMP and Ca2+ are necessary to trigger microneme secretion. The study suggests that cAMP-dependent signaling pathways play a crucial role in the regulation of microneme secretion during invasion. The identification of these pathways provides potential targets for inhibiting blood-stage parasite growth and preventing malaria.

The study used pharmacological inhibitors to explore the role of a specific adenylyl cyclase, PfACβ, in regulating cAMP levels in Plasmodium merozoites. The results show that PfACβ is activated in response to a low potassium environment, leading to an increase in cAMP levels and PKA activation. The study also suggests that alternative signaling mechanisms may exist in P. falciparum merozoites, as PfRH1 knock-out parasites were able to invade erythrocytes efficiently.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A recent review of studies from the past 20 years found that this parasite is widespread globally, except in the far north and south. However, estimates of its prevalence are often based on educated guesses due to a lack of reliable data.

The review analyzed 354 studies from 78 countries, including community-based, hospital-based, and studies on refugees and immigrants. The results showed that S. stercoralis infection is prevalent in many African, Asian, and South American countries, particularly in resource-poor areas where information is lacking. The meta-analysis found a strong association between HIV-infection and S. stercoralis infection, as well as between alcoholism and S. stercoralis infection.

High infection rates were found in the general population in selected countries and geographical regions. S. stercoralis infection is also prominent in several risk groups, including refugees, immigrants, and individuals with HIV-infection or alcoholism. In developed countries, strongyloidiasis remains an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from deployment in endemic areas.

The review highlights the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings, as well as integration into global helminth control programs. The authors emphasize that S. stercoralis should not be neglected and that more data is required for almost all countries and various socio-economic/cultural settings.
Researchers have investigated the role of stochastic noise in circadian rhythms, which are biological processes that occur in living organisms over a 24-hour cycle. Stochastic noise refers to the random fluctuations that occur at the cellular level, influencing how groups of cells synchronize with external cues and generate internal rhythms. Despite its importance, few studies have examined how disruptions to the circadian clock affect stochastic noise. To address this gap, scientists developed a new method to measure stochastic noise in cultured cells by analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings. This approach allows researchers to infer changes in single-cell noise from population-level data, making it easier to study the effects of genetic or pharmacological perturbations on circadian rhythms.

Using this method, the researchers found that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. They also demonstrated that small molecule modulators can change the damping rate of cultured cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that these changes can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. Furthermore, the researchers applied their method to a genome-wide siRNA screen and found that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. The study suggests that the unperturbed circadian clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as few gene perturbations can simultaneously increase amplitude and lower stochastic noise. This research highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly in the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.
Researchers investigated the binding pocket of PC190723, an inhibitor of the bacterial division protein FtsZ, across different bacterial species and genotypes. FtsZ is a promising target for new antibiotics, as it is essential for bacterial cell division and bypasses problems associated with antibiotic resistance. PC190723 has shown in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activity, but its mechanism of action and effect on FtsZ in other species are unclear.

Using a statistical method called PocketFEATURE and molecular dynamics simulations, the researchers analyzed the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket. They found that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. The analysis predicted that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state and that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding.

The results demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, providing important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors. The study highlights the importance of evaluating the 3D environment of a drug-binding pocket to understand the molecular properties and mechanisms governing drug-protein interactions. The findings suggest that PC190723 may be specifically effective for binding to Staphylococcus FtsZ proteins and their close relatives, and that PocketFEATURE can aid in the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the HIV-2 integrase (IN) protein in complex with its cellular binding partner, lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF). LEDGF is essential for the efficient replication of lentiviruses, such as HIV, by facilitating the integration of viral DNA into active transcription units. The new structure reveals key interactions between the IN protein and LEDGF, including charge-charge interactions between the N-terminal domain of IN and the IN-binding domain of LEDGF. These interactions are critical for the stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and during the early steps of HIV-1 replication.

The researchers also engineered a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. This finding provides a structural basis for the high-affinity interaction between lentiviral IN and LEDGF, and paves the way for the development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy. The study highlights the importance of the N-terminal domain of IN in the interaction with LEDGF, and shows that mutations in this domain can severely affect the interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. The results also suggest that other cellular proteins, such as hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP2), may interact with HIV-1 IN and stimulate its enzymatic activity, but their role in lentiviral integration remains to be established.
Researchers investigated the evolution and behavior of cancer stem cells, which are responsible for initiating and sustaining tumors. They developed a computational model to track the temporal evolution of cancer stem cells and explored various cell traits that influence tumor growth. These traits included cell migration, spontaneous cell death, symmetric cancer stem cell division, and telomere length and erosion.

The study found that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. An early increase in proliferation potential leads to a larger population of non-stem cancer cells, which compete with cancer stem cells and inhibit their division. Conversely, a reduction in proliferation potential loosens this inhibition, allowing cancer stem cells to divide more frequently. As a result, the sub-population of cancer stem cells becomes highly heterogeneous, leading to varying population-level dynamics, from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression.

The study suggests that the clonal diversity observed in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes present in the tumor. The researchers identified a set of orthogonal cell kinetics, including cell migration rate, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric cancer stem cell division, which influence tumor progression. They found that increased cell migration and symmetric cancer stem cell division always lead to accelerated tumor growth, while increased cell death counteracts cancer stem cell confinement and promotes self-metastatic tumor expansion.
Researchers used mathematical models to study the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of spatial heterogeneity within the human population. They found that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak size distributions and the risk of emergence per introduction. This means that even if a village is connected to a large city by a small number of commuters, it can be considered part of the city in terms of the chances of emergence and outbreak size distribution. The study suggests that only the most remote rural communities would be subject to epidemiological isolation. The researchers also found that the biology of the novel pathogen determines the emergence process, with outbreak sizes grouping according to the intermediate average reproductive number. The study's results indicate that there is a threshold beyond which spatial heterogeneity does not matter, and the pathogen can spread between communities. The researchers validated their analytical results with stochastic simulations of simple village-city models and found that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. The study's findings have implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections, suggesting that factors such as human contact patterns and host heterogeneity may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events.
Researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected from North American migratory birds over a 34-year period. The study aimed to understand the patterns of viral spread and persistence in wild bird populations, which is crucial for predicting disease emergence and developing preparedness plans. The researchers used a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses about viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment.

The study found that the host population of Charadriiformes in Delaware Bay, a known hotspot for avian influenza A viruses, does not significantly contribute to the AIV diversity in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta, Canada, are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. The analysis revealed that while AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, the long-term persistence of AIV is independent of bird flyways, with migration between populations occurring throughout North America.

The study's large-scale analysis of long-term surveillance data provides valuable insights for developing predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. The researchers identified 20 discrete regions in North America where influenza viruses have been systematically collected from wild birds, and found that the majority of genetic diversity of the North American influenza gene pool is captured in Alberta. The study highlights the importance of Anseriformes' social behavior in the persistence of the virus population, and suggests that breeding birds converging in this region facilitate the spread and generation of influenza virus genetic diversity.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, that targets a specific site on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A viruses. This antibody shows broad cross-reactivity, meaning it can neutralize multiple subtypes of the virus, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. In laboratory tests, MAb S139/1 was able to inhibit hemagglutination and neutralize the infectivity of various influenza A virus strains. The antibody's mechanism of action is thought to involve blocking the virus's ability to bind to host cells. By doing so, MAb S139/1 prevents the virus from entering and infecting cells. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that a single antibody can provide protection against multiple subtypes of the virus. The researchers also found that mice immunized with MAb S139/1 showed heterosubtypic protection, meaning they were protected against different subtypes of the virus. The study's results support the idea that cross-reactive antibodies can play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection. The findings also highlight the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies as a treatment for influenza. Sequence analysis of mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S139/1 revealed amino acid substitutions at specific positions on the HA protein, which are located on the globular head of the protein and form a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain.
Researchers conducted a three-year study to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adults living in a remote community in northern Australia. Participants were tested for S. stercoralis infection using a commercial ELISA kit, and those with positive results were treated with ivermectin. Follow-up tests were conducted at six months and three years after treatment.

The results showed that treatment with ivermectin was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection. The initial prevalence of infection was 35.3%, which decreased to 5.8% three years after treatment. The study also found that using a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. However, a small group of participants had persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment.

The study suggests that control of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort is feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. The prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in the study group decreased to 1.4% three years after treatment, indicating the success of this treatment strategy. The study provides evidence that a "case finding and treatment" approach can be effective in controlling chronic S. stercoralis infection in an adult Aboriginal population.
Researchers have investigated the interactions between prion strains, which are misfolded proteins that cause diseases such as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Prion strains can interfere with each other when a long-incubation period strain blocks the conversion of a short-incubation period strain. However, it was unknown whether two long-incubation period strains could interfere with each other. In this study, animals were co-infected with combinations of long-incubation period strains, but no evidence of strain interference was found. To further investigate, the researchers used a laboratory technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi), which showed that both co-infecting strains were amplifying independently. This suggests that the lack of strain interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells, but is an inherent property of the strains involved. The researchers also found that long-incubation period strains contained relatively high levels of a protein called PrPC, which is necessary for prion formation. This abundance of PrPC may allow long-incubation period strains to amplify independently, even when co-infected with other strains. These findings change the understanding of prion strain interactions and have implications for the transmission of prion diseases between species and the emergence of new prion strains from a mixture.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation. Allosteric regulation is a process where the binding of a molecule to one site on a protein affects the activity of another site. Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, but it was previously thought that their intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing allosteric coupling. The new model, which considers both order-disorder and order-order transitions, reveals that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery. This suggests that IDPs/IDRs may not be as advantageous in allosteric regulation as previously thought. The model also provides an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable for allostery. This finding has implications for the rational design of allosteric drugs. The study highlights the complexity of the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation and suggests that their prevalence may be due to factors beyond their capacity to endow allostery. Further research is needed to fully understand the importance of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and cancer. β-Catenin is a protein essential for various developmental processes and has been linked to tumorigenesis in several tissues, including prostate cancer. However, its specific function in prostate cancer remains unclear. To address this, scientists conducted in vivo genetic studies in mouse embryos and adults to understand β-Catenin's role in normal and neoplastic prostate development. They found that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is necessary for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin regulates the number of progenitor cells in the epithelial buds and controls a network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that it is not required for disease progression in this setting. Conversely, overexpression of β-Catenin, achieved through protein stabilization, promoted the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. Notably, β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss drove progression to invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplasia. These findings demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that high levels of this protein can drive squamous fate differentiation. Furthermore, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of the disease.
Researchers conducted a study to understand how to obtain informed consent for a biomedical study in a low-income setting, specifically among people with podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in southern Ethiopia. They used a qualitative approach, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, and community leaders. The study found that the way information is presented, the use of everyday language, and addressing participants' expectations significantly impact their understanding of the research. Approaching patients through trusted individuals and community sensitization before individual consent was considered the most effective way to communicate.

The study also identified potential barriers to obtaining genuine informed consent, including poverty, lack of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on podoconiosis prevention and treatment. Researchers emphasized the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of consent processes on a study-by-study basis to ensure that information is provided in a comprehensible manner and supports voluntary decision-making.

The study highlighted the need for researchers to understand the social and cultural context of the community and potential research participants before seeking informed consent. The researchers adapted their approach to the local context, using locally used terms to explain genetic concepts and avoiding written information sheets and consent forms, which were not favored by participants. They also emphasized the importance of ensuring "true voluntariness" and involving reputable local intermediaries in the consent process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system. T cells, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in maintaining the body's integrity by recognizing and responding to antigens. To understand how T cells proliferate, the researchers used a technique called single-cell multicolour flow cytometry to analyze the cell cycle of T cells in mice. They found that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, meaning it varies greatly from cell to cell, and is influenced by factors such as genetic background, age, and cell differentiation stage.

The researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the cell cycle of T cells and estimate proliferation rates and cell cycle durations. They found that T cells from different genetic backgrounds, such as FVB and C57BL/6 mice, have different proliferation rates and cell cycle durations. Additionally, they found that T cells from older mice have altered proliferation rates and cell cycle durations compared to younger mice.

The study provides new insights into the dynamics of T cell proliferation and highlights the importance of considering genetic background and age when studying the immune system. The model developed in this study can be used to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from experimental data, allowing for a better understanding of the complex processes involved in T cell development and function. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the immune system and may contribute to the development of new treatments for immune-related diseases.
Researchers have identified a new mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mouse cells that mimics a human disease-causing mutation. This mutation, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene, leads to abnormal folding of the tRNAIle, which cannot be charged with isoleucine. As a result, cells harboring the mutant tRNA produce high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering a compensatory response to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis. This response partially compensates for the deficiency caused by the mutation.

The study demonstrates that the pathogenic mechanism induced by the mouse and human mutations is the same, and that the compensatory mechanism can explain the variable penetrance of the disease in humans. The researchers propose that this mechanism can allow for the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs, where two deleterious alleles can be fixed in two steps, rather than requiring simultaneous mutation of both.

The study also highlights the difference between mutations affecting protein-coding genes and tRNA genes. While mutations in protein-coding genes can lead to a decrease in overall protein synthesis rate, mutations in tRNA genes can promote different disease patterns. The researchers suggest that this mechanism may generate an epistatic-like effect, where a partial suppression of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs is exerted.

This study provides new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial tRNA mutations and the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs. It also highlights the importance of studying homoplasmic pathological tRNA mutations with unexplained partial penetrance of the disease. The findings have implications for understanding human pathology and the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs.
Researchers investigated how the active X chromosome is regulated in human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes instead of the usual two. In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by doubling the expression of X-linked genes in both males and females, and inactivating one X chromosome in females. The study used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in triploid cells. The results showed that the average X:autosome expression ratio was lower in triploid cells with one active X and higher in triploid cells with two active X's compared to normal diploid cells. This suggests that X-linked gene expression is not strictly adjusted to achieve a perfect balance in triploid cells.

The study found that absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy were similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no global effect on autosomal expression. However, in triploid cells with two active X's, X-linked gene expression was found to be approximately doubled. In contrast, in triploid cells with a single active X, X-linked gene expression was further increased, suggesting an epigenetic adjustment in response to the X:autosome ratio. The researchers identified a subset of genes whose expression levels were proportional to the number of autosomal sets, indicating that they are regulated in a dosage-sensitive manner. Overall, the study suggests that X-linked gene expression is up-regulated in triploid cells, but not strictly in response to an autosomal counting factor.
Researchers have re-examined the dN/dS ratio, a measure used to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins. The dN/dS ratio compares the rate of substitutions at non-synonymous sites (dN) to synonymous sites (dS). This measure was originally developed for comparing distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. However, it is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms.

The study found that the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient when samples are drawn from a single population. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection, dN/dS>1, is not observed within a population. The relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, making it difficult to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements in population-genetic samples.

The researchers also found that standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are sensitive to the assumption of divergent lineages. When samples are drawn from a single population, the differences between sequences do not represent fixation events along independent lineages, but rather polymorphisms segregating in a single population. The study's results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples, highlighting the need to understand the relationship between selection pressures and the dN/dS statistic for samples from a single population. The findings also suggest that the power of the dN/dS statistic to detect positive selection is low when the majority of sites in the protein evolve under purifying selection.
Scientists have long sought to understand how natural selection influences patterns of genetic variation across genomes. Research has shown that neutral genetic diversity within species is reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection. However, the effect of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence between species remains unclear. A new study examines whether natural selection affects divergence between closely and distantly related species. The researchers found that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. Similarly, neutral divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist even after accounting for potential confounding factors. Coalescent models suggest that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome. The study's findings indicate that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species. This challenges previous intuition that selection does not affect divergence at linked neutral sites between distantly diverged species. The results have implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
Researchers have discovered that the CK2 kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of the CLOCK (CLK) protein in the Drosophila circadian oscillator. CLK is a transcription factor that helps control the expression of genes involved in the circadian clock. The study found that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, but also reduces its activity. This is in contrast to the CK1 kinase, which promotes CLK degradation. The regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. Downregulating the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 leads to CLK degradation, even in the absence of the PER and TIM proteins, which normally inhibit CLK transcriptional activity. This suggests that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The study's findings indicate that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from the counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2. The CK2 kinase may be a key player in regulating the circadian clock by promoting CLK stability and decreasing its activity. Further research is needed to understand how CK2 and other kinases interact to set CLK transcriptional activity to a proper phase in the circadian cycle.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas' disease, and its insect vector, Rhodnius prolixus. The study found that cruzipain promotes the adhesion of T. cruzi to the midgut of R. prolixus. The researchers treated T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or cysteine peptidase inhibitors and observed a significant decrease in parasite adhesion to the insect midgut, with the exception of one inhibitor, CA074-OMe. Cystatin, a cysteine peptidase inhibitor, showed a dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. The study also found that T. cruzi isolates with naturally low levels of active cruzipain adhered to the insect gut to a lesser extent than those with high levels of active cruzipain. Furthermore, transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, had reduced levels of active cruzipain and adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. The addition of exogenous cruzipain partially restored the adhesion of these transgenic parasites. In vivo colonization experiments revealed that the transgenic parasites had low levels of colonization in the insect, but parasites isolated after passage in the insect showed a drastic enhancement in the expression of surface cruzipain. These findings highlight the role of cruzipain in the interaction between T. cruzi and its insect host.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that can suppress the effects of mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, a protein essential for various cellular processes including mitosis. Dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that plays a crucial role in centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation. To identify potential regulators of dynein, the researchers conducted a genome-wide screen using a sensitized genetic background in C. elegans. They found that reducing the function of these 20 genes suppressed the conditional heavy chain mutants, but not other conditionally mutant loci. Twelve of the suppressor genes did not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function was reduced in wild-type worms. The researchers also found that two dynein light chains, DYLT-1 and DYRB-1, localized to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dynein heavy chain. Furthermore, knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains suppressed the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. These findings suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) occur during somatic differentiation, involving the precise elimination of at least 45,000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES) through a cut-and-close mechanism. A domesticated transposase, PiggyMac, is essential for DNA cleavage, and the Ligase IV component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is involved in DSB repair at excision sites. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR, researchers focused on Ku, the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and three Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the P. tetraurelia genome, with Ku70a and Ku80c being produced during sexual processes and localizing specifically in the developing new somatic nucleus. RNA interference experiments showed that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus. Furthermore, PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. The Ku70a/Ku80c heterodimer co-purifies with PiggyMac in a heterologous system, indicating that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR. This study provides the first evidence that Ku is absolutely required in vivo to introduce programmed DSBs during PGR in P. tetraurelia.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in mice to understand the molecular events leading to neuronal damage and death. They isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons from infected mice using laser capture microdissection and analyzed their gene expression over time. The study found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic, with distinct phases of activity during the pre-clinical stage of the disease. A cluster of genes involved in synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways was found to be altered during this stage. Additionally, genes related to neuronal projection and dendrite development were also affected, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-140-5p showed concomitant patterns of expression. These findings suggest that prion replication triggers a programmed response in hippocampal neurons, mediated by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response is terminated before the onset of clinical symptoms, indicating a critical juncture in the disease. The study's results provide new insights into the early mechanisms of prion pathobiology and may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies to manipulate early neuroprotective pathways and prevent neuronal degeneration.
Researchers have developed a computer model, known as a Petri net model, to simulate the formation and function of granulomas in the liver of mice infected with the parasite Leishmania donovani. A granuloma is a cluster of immune cells that forms in response to the infection and eventually eliminates the parasite. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with data from experimental studies in mice and was found to accurately replicate the progression of the disease and the changes in cellular composition within the granulomas over time.

The model revealed a previously unknown level of diversity in the development of anti-parasite activity among different granulomas. It also suggested that the cytokine IL-10, produced by infected Kupffer cells at the center of the granuloma, plays a key role in regulating the immune response. The model did not account for the potential effects of IL-10 outside the granuloma, such as its impact on T cell differentiation in other tissues.

The researchers used data from real-time imaging and tissue analysis to parameterize the model, which was approved by the University of York Ethical Review Process and conducted in accordance with animal welfare guidelines. The study's findings support the idea that granulomatous inflammation is a key component of protective immunity against Leishmania infection, and that T cells play a central role in this process. Depletion of T cells in the model led to a high parasite burden and a non-healing course of infection, consistent with previous studies in T cell-deficient mice.
Researchers have explored the idea that the transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. By analyzing a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation, the authors demonstrate that different parameterizations of this model can approximate various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality operations. This is in contrast to previous studies that focused on logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters, which can be independently tuned. The authors also show that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complex computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. Furthermore, they demonstrate that multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter can be used to approximate analytic functions. These findings have implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
A recent outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Northeast region of Brazil has been found to be caused by multiple genotypes of the virus. Genome sequencing of clinical samples revealed that both the Asian/Caribbean and African ECSA genotypes of CHIKV are cocirculating in the region. Furthermore, the study found evidence of simultaneous infection by both genotypes in at least six clinical samples, suggesting that coinfection may be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas. This is the first time that simultaneous infection by two different CHIKV genotypes has been reported in the same region.

The study used a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to directly detect multiple known CHIKV genotypes from clinical positive samples. This approach allowed researchers to identify the presence of both genotypes in the same samples, providing new insights into the epidemiology and evolution of CHIKV in Brazil. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the spread of CHIKV and the development of effective control measures.

CHIKV has caused significant health and economic burdens worldwide, and its introduction to Brazil in 2014 led to rapid spread in a large naive human population. The study highlights the importance of considering the possibility of coinfection by different genotypes in the human population when studying CHIKV epidemiology. Further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics of CHIKV transmission and the impact of coinfection on disease outcomes.
The bacterial modulator H-NS plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to external stimuli, such as osmolarity and temperature. Research has shown that H-NS targets both core genome and horizontally acquired (HGT) genes, silencing their expression. However, a new study reveals that H-NS discriminates between core and HGT DNA, differentially modulating their expression. The study found that plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins have evolved to selectively silence HGT genes, without interfering with core genome regulation. In contrast, chromosomally-encoded H-NS requires a helper protein, Hha, to specifically silence HGT genes, while modulating core genes through H-NS homoligomers. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. This unique feature of the H-NS system in enteric bacteria may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form, giving these bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization. The study provides evidence that H-NS interacts with Hha/YmoA family members to specifically silence HGT genes, and that coregulation of gene expression by H-NS/Hha proteins has been observed in several enteric bacteria.
Researchers studied the gene expression of Leishmania parasites, which cause a range of diseases in humans, to understand how they adapt to different hosts. They compared the gene expression of three Leishmania species, L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, and found that most genes are highly conserved across the species. However, a small number of genes are differentially distributed between the species, and the researchers investigated whether these genes are expressed in the disease-causing stage of the parasite, known as the amastigote.

Using custom-made microarrays, the researchers confirmed that all differentially distributed genes are expressed in amastigotes, but only a few are regulated at the RNA level. In the first large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis, the researchers found that only about 9% of genes are regulated during the parasite's life cycle. Comparing gene expression profiles between species revealed that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation, but also identified conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host.

The researchers also investigated how host immune competence affects parasite gene expression by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes from wild-type and immunologically compromised mice. They found that parasite dissemination is enhanced in immunocompromised mice, but parasite RNA expression profiles remain unchanged. These findings suggest that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called LAMPhimerus, to detect the Amphimerus sp. liver fluke in human stool samples. This parasite causes a disease called amphimeriasis, which is endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador. Current methods for diagnosing amphimeriasis involve examining stool samples for parasite eggs, but these methods are not sensitive and can be confused with other parasites. The new LAMPhimerus assay uses a technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect DNA from the Amphimerus sp. parasite. The assay was optimized using DNA from adult worms recovered from animals and was tested on 44 human stool samples from areas where the parasite is common. The results showed that the LAMPhimerus assay was 76.67% sensitive and 80.77% specific in detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in stool samples. The assay was also shown to be highly specific for Amphimerus sp. DNA, with no cross-reactivity with DNA from other parasites. The detection limit of the assay was 1 pg of genomic DNA. The LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to be used for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in areas where amphimeriasis is endemic. Further studies are needed to validate the assay and assess its applicability in large-scale settings.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the SNARE protein Ykt6 in the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion is a critical step in autophagy, a cellular process that breaks down and recycles damaged or dysfunctional cellular components. The study found that Ykt6 forms a complex with other SNARE proteins, including Syx17 and Snap29, to facilitate the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This complex is essential for autophagosome clearance in Drosophila larval fat cells, and loss of Ykt6 leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes.

The researchers also found that Ykt6 localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes, and forms a SNARE complex with Syx17 and Snap29. However, Ykt6 can be outcompeted from this complex by Vamp7, another SNARE protein. Overexpression of Vamp7 rescues the fusion defect in cells lacking Ykt6, suggesting that Vamp7 plays a direct role in membrane fusion. The study also identified a point mutant form of Ykt6 that retains normal autophagic activity and restores full viability in mutant animals.

These findings suggest that Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, while Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion. The study provides new insights into the complex machinery that mediates autophagosome-lysosome fusion in metazoans, and highlights the importance of Ykt6 in this process.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the host's innate immune defense against bacterial infections. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), a common inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, can cause opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. To evade the bactericidal effects of AMPs, NTHI has developed a mechanism to resist these peptides. The Sap ABC transporter, which includes the periplasmic binding protein SapA, is responsible for this resistance.

Research has shown that SapA binds to AMPs and is essential for NTHI virulence in vivo. A study has now demonstrated that SapA directly counteracts the lethality of AMPs during NTHI infection. The researchers hypothesized that SapA delivers AMPs to the inner membrane complex for transport into the bacterial cytoplasm, where they are susceptible to degradation by cytoplasmic peptidase activity.

The study found that AMPs localized to the bacterial cytoplasm of the parental NTHI strain, where they were degraded. In contrast, AMPs accumulated in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. These results support a novel mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs, which reduces their accumulation in the periplasm and inner membrane. This study provides the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to bacterial virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo.
Researchers investigated the role of active degradation in the regulation of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA in Escherichia coli. MarA has a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to Lon protease activity and regulates over 60 downstream targets involved in antibiotic resistance and stress response. The researchers modified MarA's half-life by knocking down the protease that targets it or engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. They found that active degradation affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. Increasing MarA's half-life increased the maximum coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but the rate at which the wild-type and modified MarA generated coordination was different. The study suggests that active degradation may allow for a more responsive and agile signaling network, enabling a few remaining cells to rapidly generate phenotypic diversity following antibiotic challenge.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major, a parasite that causes skin lesions. In a previous study, they found that MKP-2 deficient mice were more susceptible to another parasite, Leishmania mexicana. However, in this study, they infected MKP-2 deficient mice with Leishmania major and found that they were able to control the infection just like wild-type mice. The researchers measured the size of the lesions and the number of parasites in the mice and found no significant difference between the two groups. They also analyzed the immune response of the mice and found that the MKP-2 deficient mice had a reduced TH1 response, which is a type of immune response that helps to fight off infections. However, they also found that the TH2 response, another type of immune response, was equally suppressed in the MKP-2 deficient mice. As a result, the balance between the TH1 and TH2 responses was not altered in the MKP-2 deficient mice. The researchers also found that the macrophages, a type of immune cell, from the MKP-2 deficient mice were equally effective at killing the parasites as the macrophages from the wild-type mice. Overall, the study suggests that the absence of MKP-2 does not affect the ability of mice to control Leishmania major infections.
Researchers have investigated the development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that does not exhibit stereotypic branching patterns. They found that the network undergoes a transition from unconnected microlumen to a mesh of interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. This process is poorly understood, both on a microscopic and macroscopic level. The study quantified the network properties at different developmental stages and found that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each stage. The network properties change with time towards the most economical and optimized delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum.

Using in silico modeling, the researchers deconstructed the main steps of network development into a set of simple rules. They found that the creation of the early network from E10.5 to E12.5 can be explained by noisy, redundant duct formation as new microlumens form. The later transition is attributed to pruning of the network based on the flux of fluid running through the pancreatic network into the duodenum. The study shows that the pancreatic ductal system has stereotypic traits at each stage and that its remodeling can be quantified by standard network measures. The findings suggest that the organ-forming rules proposed here are likely to be conserved for many other glands that exhibit connecting microlumen, such as the salivary gland.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamical features of kinesin motor domains, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that facilitate movement along microtubules. A comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular dynamics simulations revealed three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, including the microtubule-binding α4–α5 subdomain, loop8 subdomain, and α2b-β4-β6-β7 motor domain tip.

Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations showed that all three nucleotide states (ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free Eg5) can sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. The simulations also revealed differences in the dynamic coupling of distal sites, with the neck-linker, loop8, and α4–α5 subdomain displaying correlated motions in ATP-bound simulations that are absent in ADP-bound simulations. Further analysis identified a network of dynamic communication between the active site, microtubule-binding interface, and neck-linker via loop7 and loop13.

The results suggest that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. The simulations also highlighted sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites. Mutations in loop13 were found to reduce the flexibility of these regions and disrupt their couplings.
Researchers have developed a new approach to accurately interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a widely used gene expression reporter. The Lux system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for eukaryotic cells and can measure gene expression in real-time without harming the cells. However, interpreting bioluminescent data has been challenging due to nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. A new mathematical model has been created to relate gene expression to light output, taking into account the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre enzymes, as well as the synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model was calibrated with experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxEC. The model shows that bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian inference scheme, researchers can reverse-engineer promoter activity from bioluminescence data. This approach can help users of Lux technology to better understand gene expression patterns and make more accurate interpretations of bioluminescent data. The model can also be applied to experiments using sub-lethal doses of antimicrobials to measure gene expression, including antimicrobial resistance genes.
Researchers have elucidated the structure of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with a capsid binder called GPP3, which has been shown to inhibit the replication of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and CVA16, the primary causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3 reveals the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Using this model, the researchers performed in silico docking to investigate the interactions with two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, which were found to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with promising pharmacological properties.

The researchers also analyzed the structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity. They used the same in silico protocol to dock two recently designed capsid binders into the CVA16 crystal structure, demonstrating that they have a similar binding mode. The structural and in silico results were analyzed in the context of the antiviral activity of these inhibitors against a wide range of enteroviruses, showing their potency and broad-spectrum antiviral activity.

The researchers tested the activity of these inhibitors against a panel of enteroviruses and found that NLD showed good anti-poliovirus activity, with an EC50 of 12 nM. Structural comparisons were used to correlate structural features with differences in antiviral activity, reinforcing the potential of NLD as a candidate for a HFMD drug. The study highlights the hydrophobic pocket below the canyon in VP1 as an interesting target for the development of novel inhibitors that target the early stage of enterovirus infection.
Researchers have identified the cells and receptor responsible for removing the Necrotic serpin from the haemolymph in Drosophila melanogaster. The Necrotic serpin plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections by inhibiting a proteolytic cascade that activates the Toll receptor. This cascade leads to the production of antibiotic peptides in the fat-body and their export to the haemolymph. The researchers found that the Necrotic serpin is removed from the haemolymph by two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. They used a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis and observed that the serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein HRS. The researchers also identified the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (LpR1) as a receptor that enhances the immune response and is responsible for the uptake of the Necrotic serpin from the haemolymph. Knockdown of the Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family, including LpR1, identified LpR1 as the receptor responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin. Mutations that block late endosome/lysosome fusion caused accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from the athrocytes. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades.
Researchers have identified the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in sea urchin larvae. Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side, while BMP signaling is required for the development of left-sided structures. The study found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in the small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, the researchers demonstrated that BMP signaling is necessary for the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. In contrast, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling, controlling LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. The findings suggest that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, indicating that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes. The study also revealed that BMP signaling is required for right-sided Nodal expression in the sea urchin embryo, which is consistent with observations in vertebrates. The research provides new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in sea urchin embryos and sheds light on the conserved mechanisms of LR patterning in deuterostomes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G1 cells supporting viral immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceeding to the G1/S boundary where they arrest. In contrast, S/G2 cells can be infected but block IE gene expression, which is not relieved until host cells have divided and reentered G1. During latent infection, IE gene expression is also inhibited, and for reactivation to occur, this block must be overcome.

Research has shown that the block to IE gene expression during S and G2 phases can be overcome by genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, indicating the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression requires p53, and in the absence of checkpoint activation, it is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is required downstream of p53, suggesting a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2.

Treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53, and CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 cells. This suggests that a timely block to CDK activity not only secures phase specificity of the cell cycle-dependent HCMV IE gene expression program but also plays a role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which some individuals with HIV-1, known as elite controllers, are able to control the virus without treatment. These individuals have highly functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses, but the mechanisms behind this immunity were not well understood. The study found that dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in this process. When exposed to HIV-1, dendritic cells from elite controllers rapidly produce type I interferons and upregulate genes that help fight the virus. This cell-intrinsic immune response is associated with reduced viral replication and improved ability to stimulate HIV-1-specific T cell responses. The researchers also found that this response is mediated by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and is inhibited by blocking viral reverse transcription or silencing cGAS. Importantly, this improved immune recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells from elite controllers translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. These findings suggest that cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells is essential for the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells. This discovery may have implications for the development of immunologic approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention, particularly for vaccine candidates that rely on dendritic cells to induce HIV-1-specific immune responses.
Researchers have developed a new screening method to identify genes that regulate fat storage in Drosophila larvae. The method, based on buoyancy, allows for the detection of larvae with increased levels of stored fat. Using this approach, the researchers identified 66 genes that, when mutated, result in increased fat storage. One of these genes, Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family, was found to play a key role in regulating fat storage. Sirtuins are known to regulate the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins.

The researchers found that knockdown of Sir2 in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels, and that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. This suggests that Sir2 regulates fat storage by controlling the expression of metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild-type larvae under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. This indicates that Sir2 mediates a pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation, regardless of the sugar content of the diet. The findings suggest that Sir2 is a key regulator in the switch from utilizing ingested nutrients to stored fat as an energy source.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand the evolution of asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division is crucial for generating cellular diversity, and the mitotic spindle plays a key role in determining the size and fate of daughter cells. The study recorded the first embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species, providing a large collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of cellular processes.

The results showed that all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, but exhibited large variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. These parameters changed frequently during evolution, with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, contrasting with expectations based on C. elegans studies.

The findings demonstrate that while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. This suggests that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift, similar to other developmental processes. The study provides new insights into the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior and highlights the importance of studying multiple species to understand the complexity of cellular processes.
Researchers studied how two closely related bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respond to acid stress. They found that despite having identical OmpR proteins, the two bacteria have distinct responses to acid stress. In Salmonella Typhimurium, acid stress triggers the production of OmpR protein and its binding to specific genes in the genome. In contrast, Escherichia coli does not respond to acid stress in the same way. The researchers discovered that the difference in response is due to variations in the promoter regions of the ompR genes, which control the production of OmpR protein. They found that introducing the promoter region from Salmonella Typhimurium into Escherichia coli made it respond to acid stress like Salmonella Typhimurium. The OmpR regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium includes many genes that are not found in Escherichia coli, including some that are involved in virulence. The researchers also found that OmpR binds to its target genes more easily when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in response to acid stress in Salmonella Typhimurium. This ability to bind to relaxed DNA allows OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon and modulate transcription in response to acid stress. The study suggests that the ability of OmpR to bind to relaxed DNA is a key factor in its ability to regulate gene expression in response to acid stress in Salmonella Typhimurium.
Researchers have identified a novel protein, named Nuclear Effector (NUE), secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. NUE contains a SET domain, characteristic of histone methyltransferases, and is translocated to the host cell nucleus during infection. The protein associates with chromatin and exhibits enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransferase, targeting histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself through automethylation. Automethylation appears to enhance NUE's enzymatic activity, increasing its affinity for target substrates.

In vitro assays confirmed NUE's ability to methylate mammalian histones, with a preference for histone H2B over a chlamydial histone, Hc1. The study demonstrates that NUE is the first bacterial effector to directly target mammalian histones, highlighting its potential role in Chlamydia's pathogenicity. The researchers propose designating CT737 and its homologs in other chlamydiae genomes as NUE, as it is the first nuclear effector identified in chlamydiae.

Further investigation is needed to determine the genes regulated by NUE translocation in the nucleus during Chlamydia infection, as the absence of a genetic system to manipulate Chlamydia complicates this analysis. However, the discovery of NUE's enzymatic activity and its targeting of mammalian histones provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Chlamydia's infection process.
A recent study investigated the potential role of recessive genetic effects on human height by analyzing data from over 35,000 individuals from 21 different population samples. The researchers found a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, indicating that inbreeding depression can lead to a reduction in height. Specifically, the study found that the offspring of first cousins had a height reduction of up to 3 cm compared to the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained significant even after controlling for socio-economic status, a potential confounding factor.

The study used three different measures of genomic homozygosity to assess the relationship between inbreeding and height, and all three methods showed a strong correlation with reduced height. The researchers also found that the effect size of inbreeding depression on height varied significantly among different populations, suggesting that the genetic architecture of height may be influenced by population-specific factors.

The study's findings provide evidence for a polygenic recessive component to the genetic architecture of height, indicating that many rare, recessive variants contribute to the trait. This research has implications for understanding the genetic basis of height and other heritable quantitative traits, and the methodology developed in this study can be applied to investigate inbreeding effects on a range of traits of biomedical importance.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of peripheral blood monocyte (MO) that is associated with anti-parasitic activity in patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune response. The study found that patients with high numbers of a specific subset of monocytes, characterized by the presence of CD14, CCR2, and CX3CR1 markers, had lower levels of parasites in their blood compared to patients with low numbers of these monocytes. This subset of monocytes was also associated with strong antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) activity, which is a mechanism by which the immune system can kill parasites.

The researchers characterized the phenotype of monocytes from patients with acute uncomplicated malaria and healthy malaria-exposed individuals using flow cytometry. They found that patients with acute malaria had higher percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ monocytes and CCR2+CX3CR1+ monocytes compared to healthy controls. The study also showed that the expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14high monocyte subset defined two subgroups of patients that differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth.

The results suggest that during a malaria attack, some patients' monocytes can exert a strong ADCI activity, which is associated with lower levels of parasites in the blood. The study provides new insights into the complex relationships between the phenotype and functional activity of blood monocytes from patients and healthy malaria-exposed individuals, and suggests that discrete monocyte subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the relationship between Schistosoma mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility in Ugandan men. The study involved 34 HIV- and malaria-uninfected men who underwent elective circumcision, 12 of whom were infected with S. mansoni and 12 of whom were not. The researchers found that S. mansoni infection was associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible T cell subsets, including Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, in the blood of infected men compared to uninfected men. Specifically, the frequency of Th1 cells was 22.9% in infected men versus 16.5% in uninfected men, Th17 cells was 2.3% in infected men versus 1.5% in uninfected men, and Th22 cells was 0.5% in infected men versus 0.3% in uninfected men. Additionally, the researchers found that Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function, producing multiple cytokines at a higher rate than in uninfected men. However, these immune alterations were not observed in the foreskin tissue of infected men. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may increase the risk of HIV infection by increasing the frequency and function of HIV-susceptible T cell subsets in the blood, but this effect does not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism behind the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in treating filarial diseases. Filarial nematodes, the parasites responsible for these diseases, have a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria Wolbachia. Depleting Wolbachia through antibiotic treatment causes significant defects in the nematodes' development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. However, the underlying reasons for this relationship were not well understood.

Using whole mount confocal microscopy, the researchers observed that depleting Wolbachia leads to extensive apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the adult germline, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae. Notably, apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment. This suggests that the effects of Wolbachia depletion are non-cell autonomous, meaning that factors originating from Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords are involved.

The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following Wolbachia depletion, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. These effects are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. The researchers' observations provide a cellular mechanism to explain the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occur prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, which target the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. These compounds, including pantothenol and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by interfering with its coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis or utilization. However, the exact mechanism of action of these compounds has not been fully understood. To address this, researchers used continuous drug-pressuring with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 to generate parasite lines resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in the pantothenate kinase (PfPanK) gene, Pfpank1, in all resistant lines. These mutations significantly altered PfPanK activity, with some conferring a fitness cost, indicating that Pfpank1 is essential for normal parasite growth. The resistant lines exhibited different sensitivity profiles to various pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive to a different class of analogues. This suggests that antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues have at least two distinct mechanisms of action, targeting either CoA biosynthesis or utilization. The Pfpank1 mutations identified in this study influence these mechanisms, providing genetic evidence for the importance of metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in their antiplasmodial activity. These findings have implications for the development of new antiplasmodial therapies targeting the CoA biosynthetic pathway.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time, in African Americans. The study analyzed data from four cohorts of African American individuals, totaling 6,247 participants, using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. A strong signal was observed in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, with a genome-wide significant association (p<2.5×10−8) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans, with a beta value of 5.1 msec per minor allele (95% CI = 4.1-6.1, p=3×10−23). This variant was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size and variability explained. Further meta-analysis identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5, which were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian genome-wide association studies. The study found that African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not in the other three. The findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples, and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of the Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). ToMV is a type of virus that infects plants and replicates its genetic material, or RNA, in the cells of the plant. The study found that ARL8 works together with another protein called TOM1 to form a complex that is essential for the replication of ToMV. This complex is formed on the membranes of plant cells, where the virus replicates its RNA.

The researchers used a technique called co-purification to show that ARL8 and TOM1 are associated with the ToMV replication proteins in infected plant cells. They also found that when ARL8 and TOM1 are present, the ToMV replication proteins are able to synthesize new RNA and add a cap to the 5' end of the RNA, a process called capping. This capping activity is necessary for the RNA to be translated into protein.

The study suggests that ARL8 and TOM1 work together to activate the replication proteins' ability to synthesize and cap RNA. Without ARL8 and TOM1, the ToMV replication proteins are unable to perform these functions, and the virus is unable to replicate. The researchers also found that mutations in the ARL8 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant, completely inhibited the multiplication of ToMV, further supporting the importance of ARL8 in ToMV replication. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ToMV replication and the role of ARL8 and TOM1 in this process.
Researchers investigated the role of feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition in a basic olfactory circuit in locusts. Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in many brain systems. Two basic motifs, FF and FB inhibition, have been identified in various neuronal circuits. In the locust, a subset of lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) was thought to provide FF inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing. However, a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and its inhibition is mediated by a FB loop including KCs and GGN.

Using a model of the locust olfactory system, researchers found that both FF and FB inhibition were able to maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. This suggests that GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to KCs. The study highlights the importance of understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity, which could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks. The findings provide general rules for FF versus FB inhibition and shed light on the role of GGN in the locust olfactory system.
Researchers have developed a new method for diagnosing lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans. The method, called dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo RT-qPCR), uses two complementary techniques to detect different types of lyssaviruses. The first technique, a probe-based RT-qPCR, detects the rabies virus (RABV) species, while the second technique, using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green), detects other lyssavirus species.

The combo RT-qPCR method was evaluated using a large panel of animal samples representing almost all genetic variability of lyssaviruses and was found to have high sensitivity and specificity. The method was also tested on 211 human biological samples, including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies, and detected all 41 cases of human rabies. The results showed that skin biopsy and saliva samples are useful for diagnosing human rabies.

The combo RT-qPCR method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco) and is considered a relevant and useful tool for diagnosing rabies in both humans and animals. This method represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance and can be used for intra-vitam diagnosis of rabies in humans and post-mortem diagnosis in animals.
A recent outbreak of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis in the Eastern Region of Ghana resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs. To mitigate this issue, a control trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse flies. Two villages were selected, one as a control and the other as an experimental site where 24 pigsties were protected with insecticide-treated mosquito fences. The fences, made of 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m2 deltamethrin and a UV protector, were attached to surrounding timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse densities showed a significant reduction of over 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse population in the control village remained unaffected, displaying only seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in pigs was also significantly reduced in the protected village, decreasing from 76% to 16% after three months, compared to a decrease from 72% to 84% in the control village. After six months, 8% of the protected pigs were infected, compared to 60% in the control group. The results suggest that insecticide-treated mosquito fences can be an effective and sustainable method for controlling tsetse flies and reducing the risk of trypanosomiasis in domestic pigs in resource-poor areas.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 found that reproducibility and transparency practices are lacking in the scientific community. Only one study provided a full protocol, and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, with only four attempts to validate previous knowledge. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses included data from only 16 studies. The majority of articles did not mention funding or conflicts of interest, although there was a significant decrease in the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014. In contrast, the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts increased from 0% in 2000 to 15.4% in 2014. Articles published in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack information on funding and to have private funding compared to other fields. The study found no significant differences in replication, systematic review, or conflict statements across different fields. However, clinical medicine journals were more likely to not mention funding and less likely to have a PubMed Central reference number. The study highlights the need for increased transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research, with a focus on making protocols, analytical codes, and data openly available. The results provide baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature.
Researchers have identified the early host cells targeted by Yersinia pestis during primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease caused by inhalation of the bacteria. The study found that Y. pestis initially targets alveolar macrophages in the lungs, followed by a switch to neutrophils. The bacteria use a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins directly into the cells, which helps them evade the host's immune response and create a protective environment in the lungs.

The researchers used a fluorescent probe to track the injection of these effector proteins into host cells and found that alveolar macrophages are the primary target during the early stages of infection. However, the depletion of these cells had little effect on the bacterial burden in the lung, suggesting that they may not play a significant role in limiting the growth of Y. pestis.

In contrast, the influx of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, was found to be unable to limit bacterial growth and instead contributed to the severe inflammation and tissue destruction characteristic of the disease's pro-inflammatory phase. The study provides new insights into the early stages of pneumonic plague and highlights the importance of neutrophils in the progression of the disease.
Researchers conducted a study in Brazil to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests in detecting asymptomatic infections of Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study involved 136 participants who were part of a cohort with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected in 2001 and tested using ELISA with three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The results were compared to molecular biology techniques, including PCR and hybridization, which were used as reference tests.

The study found that the ELISA tests were inaccurate in detecting asymptomatic infections, with sensitivities ranging from 26.5% to 49.6% and specificities ranging from 36.8% to 73.7%. The rK39 antigen showed the highest specificity, but the lowest sensitivity. The study also found that there was low agreement among the different antigens used. The researchers concluded that serological tests, such as ELISA, are not reliable for diagnosing asymptomatic infections of Leishmania infantum, which can lead to misclassification bias in population studies. This has implications for studies that have used serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the silencing of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using gene expression microarray data. Retrotransposons are repetitive elements in the genome that can amplify and potentially disrupt gene function. To prevent this, cells have developed mechanisms to silence retrotransposons, but the details of these mechanisms are not well understood. The researchers used a computational approach to analyze microarray data and identified the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in mouse embryonic stem cells. They also found that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to silencing mechanisms, and that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the study identified retrotransposons that are targeted by DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The results suggest a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms that repress retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells. This study provides new insights into the regulation of retrotransposons in mammals and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that protect the genome from retrotransposition. The approach used in this study can be applied to gene expression microarray data to generate new insights into retrotransposon regulation and identify further components of the defense mechanisms that protect the mammalian genome.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time in response to light. CRY2 interacts with CIB1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus T (FT). CIB1 specifically binds to non-canonical E-box sequences in the chromatin region of the FT promoter in vivo, despite having a higher affinity for canonical E-box sequences in vitro. The study found that CRY2 also interacts with at least one other bHLH protein, CIB5, in response to blue light. Genetic analysis revealed that CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. Furthermore, CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, which have a higher binding affinity to non-canonical E-box sequences than CIB homodimers. This heterodimerization explains why CIB proteins bind to non-canonical E-box sequences in vivo, despite their higher affinity for canonical E-box sequences in vitro. The expression of CIB proteins is specifically regulated by blue light, consistent with the hypothesis that different CIB proteins play similar roles in the CRY2-mediated blue light signaling pathway. Overall, the study demonstrates that CIB proteins function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo.
An economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of overseas and domestic treatment and screening options for intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia. The study examined the costs and benefits of four interventions: no program, domestic screening and treatment, overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin, and overseas albendazole and domestic screening for Strongyloides. The analysis used a decision tree model and Markov processes to estimate the cost and health impacts of these interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees. The results showed that the "No Program" option was the least expensive but also the least effective, with 145 outpatient cases, 4 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over a 60-year period. In contrast, the "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option was the most effective, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted. The study found that overseas presumptive treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduced the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare but potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other microsporidian pathogens, N. displodere has a broad tissue tropism, meaning it can infect and replicate in multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine. This is distinct from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively infect and replicate in the intestine. The researchers characterized the life cycle of N. displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit, and found that the majority of replication occurs in the muscle and epidermis. The N. displodere genome was compared to those of N. parisii and N. sp. 1, revealing that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. The N. displodere genome contains over 10% of proteins that belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function, which may mediate interactions with the host. The discovery of N. displodere provides a unique model system to study the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein in transcription-coupled DNA repair. CSB is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, but its exact function in DNA repair was not well understood. This study reveals that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner, and this activity is significantly enhanced by the presence of NAP1-like histone chaperones. These chaperones bind to CSB and facilitate its ability to remodel chromatin.

The study found that the combined activities of CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones are necessary for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. This process involves the repositioning of nucleosomes to allow for the repair of damaged DNA. The researchers also discovered that CSB has two separable functions in transcription-coupled DNA repair: one is the recruitment of repair proteins, which is independent of nucleosome remodeling, and the other is the actual remodeling of chromatin.

The study used a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize CSB's remodeling activity and to understand its role in transcription-coupled DNA repair. The results suggest that the NAP1-like histone chaperones play a critical role in enhancing CSB's ability to remodel chromatin. This collaboration between CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones adds a new dimension to our understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones regulate chromatin structure. The findings of this study provide new insights into the functions of chromatin remodeling by CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair and the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying regions with high inter-individual variation in DNA methylation patterns. These regions, called Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs), were found to occur preferentially at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in five purified cell types. While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset shows highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks that have low heritability and differ between cell types. These networks are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue.

For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs was identified, enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation. Similarly, in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs was found, comprising all four HOX gene clusters and enriched for control of tissue growth. In neurons, a network of 18 VMRs was identified, enriched for roles in synaptic signaling.

The study also found that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels changing in a coordinated fashion in response to cellular growth. Notably, these environmentally-responsive VMRs showed a strong enrichment for imprinted loci, suggesting that they are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. The research provides new insights into the biology of variable methylation across the human genome and highlights the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping epigenetic variation.
Researchers have developed a new rapid test for diagnosing dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions worldwide. The test, called the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid, detects the presence of the dengue virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in the blood. When used alone, the test showed a sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 96% in a study in Vietnam, and 68.9% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity in a study in Malaysia. However, when used in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0% in both studies.

The researchers found that using the NS1 test in combination with the IgM/IgG test significantly improved the ability to diagnose dengue fever, especially in the early stages of the disease. This is because the NS1 protein is present in the blood early in the infection, while the IgM and IgG antibodies take longer to develop. By combining the two tests, healthcare providers can detect dengue fever more accurately and earlier in the course of the disease.

The study's findings suggest that the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test, when used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, can be a valuable tool for diagnosing dengue fever in clinical settings. The test's sensitivity and specificity are comparable to other commercially available NS1 rapid tests, and its ability to detect dengue fever in the early stages of the disease makes it a promising tool for public health efforts to control and prevent the spread of the disease.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called Transat to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative structures. Current RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not account for features required for in vivo folding. To address this, Transat detects conserved helices of high statistical significance, allowing for the prediction of structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted ones and alternative configurations. The method can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways. Unlike existing methods, Transat works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. This approach has the advantage of not being able to predict features as a function of time, but it provides a more accurate representation of how RNA sequences fold in vivo. Transat's predictions can enable more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations, providing useful input to the design and interpretation of future experiments. The method's ability to predict conserved helices of high statistical significance supports the notion that homologous RNA sequences not only assume similar functional RNA structures but also fold in a similar way in vivo.
Researchers have studied the immune system of plants, specifically Arabidopsis, to understand how it protects against pathogens. They found that the plant's immune network is highly resilient and can function effectively even when some of its components are disabled by pathogens. This resilience is due to a phenomenon called network buffering, where different parts of the network compensate for the loss of others' functions. The researchers used a systems biology approach called network reconstitution to study the plant immune network. They disassembled and reassembled the network step by step to understand how it responds to an immune stimulant called flagellin-22 (flg22).

The study revealed that the plant immune network is composed of four sub-networks, or signaling sectors, which are controlled by the plant hormones salicylate (SA), jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), and the immune regulator phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4). These sectors interact with each other, resulting in network buffering that conceals the functions of individual components. The researchers found that many of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the plant's response to flg22 are not detectable by traditional genetic approaches, such as single-gene null-mutant analysis. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of network reconstitution in elucidating the functions of complex biological networks, particularly those that are highly resilient against perturbations.
The development of the central nervous system begins with the formation of monolayered neuroepithelial sheets, which are then subdivided into distinct domains through patterning mechanisms. In Drosophila, the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium and the optic lobe primordium. Researchers have identified a genetic network that regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary photoreceptor (PR) precursors.

The proneural factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors.

Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, acting at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity. The expression patterns of Ato and Tll in the optic placode specifically mark domains giving rise to the larval eye precursors and the optic lobe primordium. The Notch signaling pathway regulates Ato expression and acts through lateral inhibition to select Ato-expressing R8 PR precursors. Inhibiting Notch signaling leads to a complete transformation of the optic placode to PRs of the larval eye.
Human Beta Defensin 1 (hBD1), a widely expressed antimicrobial peptide, has been found to exhibit distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Researchers have discovered that the reduced form of hBD1 forms a net-like structure that entraps bacteria, preventing their transmigration and invasion. This mechanism is independent of bacterial killing and is stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with high amounts of proteases. In contrast, the oxidized form of hBD1 does not form this net-like structure. The presence of cysteines is necessary for net formation by hBD1, unlike other defensins such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 (HD6). The redox-dependent function of hBD1 serves as an additional mechanism of action, providing host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures. This study highlights the multifunctional activities of hBD1, including distinct antimicrobial mechanisms from a single peptide. The findings suggest that hBD1 utilizes a "buy one get much more" strategy to combat bacterial challenges, utilizing multiple strategies to combat bacterial threats directly. The discovery of this redox-dependent function of hBD1 provides new insights into the modes of action of endogenous host peptides and may lead to the development of new antimicrobial strategies.
Researchers have investigated the role of the OCRL1 protein in the development of Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, which are caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene. These disorders are characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, a hallmark of renal tubulopathy. The study used zebrafish as a model to study the function of OCRL1 in the pronephric tubule, a structure similar to the mammalian renal tubule. The results show that a deficiency of OCRL1 leads to impaired endocytosis in the pronephric tubule, resulting in reduced uptake of fluid phase markers and low molecular weight proteins from the glomerular filtrate. This defect is associated with reduced abundance of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. The study also found that the catalytic activity of OCRL1 is required for renal tubular endocytosis and that suppression of PIP5K, a protein involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, can rescue the endocytic defect in OCRL1-deficient embryos. These findings suggest that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease and identify PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for these disorders. The study provides the first evidence that OCRL1 regulates endocytic trafficking in vivo and supports the hypothesis that defects in this process contribute to the pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease.
Researchers conducted a study in the Kilombero River Valley in Tanzania to investigate the transmission of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in livestock during inter-epidemic periods. The study found that 11.3% of cattle, sheep, and goats in the area had antibodies against RVF virus, indicating exposure to the virus. The prevalence of antibodies was higher in animals that were present during a previous outbreak in 2006/07, at 22.7%, compared to those born after the outbreak, at 5.5%. The study also found that animals living more than 15 kilometers from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living closer to the flood plain.

The researchers used a cross-sectional survey to collect blood samples from randomly selected animals and conducted structured interviews with herd owners to gather information on animal characteristics and environmental factors. The study found no association between RVF seropositivity and animal species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices, or altitude. However, there was a significant difference in seroprevalence between male and female animals that were present during the previous outbreak, with females having a higher prevalence.

The study's findings indicate that post-epidemic transmission of RVF is occurring in the study area, with a linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts suggesting a constant exposure to the virus. The study highlights the importance of active serological surveillance in detecting inter-epidemic transmissions of RVF, which can go undetected clinically.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, uses a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate its osmolarity. The CVC also plays a crucial role in the trafficking of surface proteins to the plasma membrane, which is essential for the parasite's ability to invade host cells. Researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of the CVC in this process. They found that the protein TcRab11, which is involved in protein trafficking, localizes to the CVC and is essential for the transport of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein trans-sialidase (TcTS) to the plasma membrane. TcTS is a surface protein that helps the parasite to infect host cells by transferring sialic acid from host proteins to parasite mucins.

The researchers created a dominant-negative mutant of TcRab11, which prevented TcTS from reaching the plasma membrane and reduced the parasite's infectivity. However, when the mutant parasites were incubated with exogenous TcTS and a sialic acid donor before infecting host cells, their infectivity was partially restored. This suggests that TcRab11 plays a crucial role in the trafficking of TcTS to the plasma membrane, and that TcTS is essential for the parasite's ability to infect host cells. The study also reveals a novel mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion in eukaryotic cells, which involves the CVC and lipid rafts.
Researchers conducted a phase III clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen for rabies vaccination. The trial involved 443 participants, including children, adolescents, and adults, who received a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) through a 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen or a 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration. The results showed that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of the percentage of participants with adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations at 49 days post-vaccination. All participants achieved adequate RVNA concentrations by 14 days post-vaccination. The 4-site/1-week regimen had similar safety profiles to the 2-site/TRC regimen, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported. The study suggests that the 4-site/1-week regimen may be an alternative to current recommendations, offering potential benefits in terms of cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination. The researchers found that RVNA concentrations were consistently lower in adults who received HRIG administration compared to those who did not. The study's findings support the use of the 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen as a viable option for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies.
Researchers investigated the brain's salience network (SN), which plays a crucial role in detecting and attending to goal-relevant events. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project, they applied novel graph-theoretical techniques to study the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. The study found that the SN exhibits distinct and robust properties, including high flexibility in connectivity with other brain networks, such as the frontoparietal network, cingulate-opercular network, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. The SN's dynamic functional interactions were also highly spatially varied, and its nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating its role as a hub for facilitating cross-network interactions. Additionally, the SN's time-varying connectivity profiles were distinct from other prefrontal control systems, and its temporal flexibility predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were replicated in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of the results. The study provides new insights into the dynamic functional architecture of the SN and highlights its unique position in facilitating interactions with multiple functional systems, supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
Researchers have identified a key protein, VP4, that plays a crucial role in the release of the nonenveloped virus SV40 from host cells. Unlike enveloped viruses, which are surrounded by a lipid membrane, nonenveloped viruses, such as SV40, must be released from the host cell without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. The study found that VP4, a protein expressed at late times during the viral life cycle, is responsible for disrupting host cell membranes to facilitate viral release. The researchers expressed and purified VP4 as a fusion protein and demonstrated its ability to bind and disrupt biological membranes. They found that the central hydrophobic domain of VP4 is essential for membrane binding and disruption, and that it forms pores of approximately 3 nanometers in diameter in mammalian cells. The study also showed that VP4 has a preference for membranes composed of lipids similar to those found in plasma membranes, rather than nuclear membranes. Additionally, the researchers found that phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found in bacterial membranes, inhibits the membrane-disrupting activity of VP4. These findings suggest that VP4 acts as a viroporin, a protein that forms pores in host cell membranes to facilitate viral release. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nonenveloped viral release and highlights the importance of VP4 in the life cycle of SV40.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine, pcTPANS1, to protect against dengue virus (DENV), a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. The vaccine, which contains the DENV2 NS1 gene, has been shown to induce a robust immune response in mice, including the production of anti-NS1 antibodies and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The study aimed to investigate the contribution of cellular and humoral immunity to the vaccine's protective effects.

The results showed that both antibody and T cell responses are necessary for effective protection against DENV. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies provided partial protection against low doses of the virus, but not against higher doses. The vaccine also induced the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with CD4+ T cells playing a critical role in protection. Depletion of CD4+ cells abolished protection, while transfer of CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antibodies from vaccinated mice restored protection.

The study highlights the importance of cooperation between CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity in mediating protection against DENV using the NS1 antigen. The findings provide new insights into the immune response elicited by the DENV NS1 antigen and have implications for the development of an effective dengue vaccine. The use of DNA immunization, which can induce both arms of the immune system, may be a promising approach for developing a vaccine against dengue.
Researchers have elucidated the structure-function relationship of the transcription factor ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which regulates competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus, combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays, reveals that XIP-binding induces the release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization to allow DNA binding. This activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but instead constitutes a new member of the RNPP family. The identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation provides a crucial step towards designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci. This research offers opportunities to engineer well-controlled peptide-based expression systems in streptococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. The ComR regulon includes the comS and comX genes, which are essential for competence in streptococci. This study provides a detailed molecular mechanism of the ComR activation process and highlights the potential of targeting the ComRS system for the development of new antibacterial agents.
Researchers have identified the first ligands that activate the prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC. These ligands, which include the neurotransmitter GABA, bind to a conserved site on the protein and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. ELIC forms cation-selective channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single-channel conductance and simple functional behavior of ELIC make it an attractive model system for studying general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.

The researchers used a combination of electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography to characterize the functional properties of ELIC. They identified a set of primary amines that activate the channel, including alkylamines, aminothiols, aminoalcohols, bromoamines, diamines, and GABA. The ligands bind to a conserved site on the protein, which is large enough to accommodate different ligands.

ELIC is closely related to other ionotropic receptors, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and GLIC. It is a cation-selective channel that is impermeable to anions. The crystal structure of ELIC shows a non-conducting conformation of the channel obtained in the absence of ligands, but it is unclear whether this structure is closer to the resting or desensitized state of the channel.
Researchers investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, a phenomenon known as the "atopic march." They found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like skin inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma, similar to humans with AD. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a protein overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, was identified as the systemic driver of this bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j, which sustained high systemic levels of TSLP, developed a severe asthmatic phenotype when exposed to an allergen. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels were required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Additionally, outbred mice that maintained high systemic levels of TSLP without developing skin pathology were found to be susceptible to asthma. Importantly, epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization. These findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients.
A comprehensive analysis of the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, was conducted using a multi-omics approach that integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with bioinformatics tools. This approach enabled the detailed annotation of various genomic features, including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, non-coding RNAs, transcription units, promoters, ribosome binding sites, and regulatory sites. The analysis revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome compared to other bacteria, including a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), a low number of putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). The study also found that the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of T. maritima have an atypical bimodal length distribution, and transcriptional regulation is limited by a lack of intergenic space for most transcription units. Furthermore, the analysis showed that a high fraction of annotated genes are expressed independently of growth state, and there is a strong linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance (Pearson r = 0.63, p < 2.2 × 10^(-16) t-test). These findings suggest that the genome organization of T. maritima is adapted to its hyperthermophilic lifestyle and may provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on Earth.
Researchers investigated how visual context influences the perception of a target bar in a display. Participants judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker contrast. When the context could be grouped well with the target, weak contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive a target, as if filling in the target. In contrast, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they grouped well with the target, biased observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for the data, suggesting that context influences perception in two ways: by biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present and by biasing their internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The study found that the context did not influence the perceived target contrast, suggesting that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for visual inferences. The results also showed that the filling-in bias was stronger when the contextual bars had weaker contrasts and when the target was seen as more likely to group with the context as a straight line.
Biologists have long been puzzled by the prevalence of cooperation in nature, particularly in the production of costly common goods. This is because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which can consume the common good without contributing fairly, leading to population collapse and the destruction of cooperation. However, researchers have discovered that defectors can sometimes create conditions that rescue cooperation. In a structured population, defectors can increase the heterogeneity in population collapse dynamics, reducing the chances that all populations go extinct simultaneously. Additionally, selection for rare mutants adapted to resource limitation, which can be induced by defectors, introduces another population bottleneck, facilitating the survival of cooperation. When defectors are initially present, they can create empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants, allowing cooperators to grow. Furthermore, resource limitation, precipitated by defectors, can select for rare cooperator and defector mutants adapted to this limitation, favoring cooperation. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators compared to when defectors are initially absent. In a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant challenge to the mucosal barrier, leading to infections primarily in individuals with compromised epithelial barriers. Research has shown that P. aeruginosa adheres almost exclusively to multi-cellular junctions in a polarized epithelium, where it binds to extruded apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies. This binding is independent of the type of cell death, as P. aeruginosa also attaches to necrotic cells. The bacteria are then internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Inside the epithelial cells, P. aeruginosa inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features, ultimately leading to the elimination of the bacteria intracellularly. This study proposes that the elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis is a host defense mechanism. The findings have implications for the study of cystic fibrosis, a condition characterized by an increased number of apoptotic cells and impaired efferocytosis. The research highlights the ability of epithelial cells to eliminate P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis, suggesting that this process may play a crucial role in preventing infection.
During embryonic development in Drosophila, the formation of the gonad involves the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). To reach the SGPs, PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm, guided by local repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. The hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) plays a crucial role in directing PGC migration. Shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. Shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PGC migration, as demonstrated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments.

The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is also essential for generating the PGC attractant produced by the SGPs and other tissues. The production of this attractant depends on shf and another hh pathway gene, gγ1. Ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release and transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. The potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification. The findings suggest that shf and the hmgcr-dependent pathway work together to orchestrate PGC migration, with shf facilitating the long-distance transmission of Hh and hmgcr generating the PGC attractant.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a trivalent adenovirus type 5 HIV recombinant vaccine in priming the immune system to recognize and eliminate HIV-infected cells. The study focused on the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T-cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in eliminating infected cells. The researchers compared the cytotoxic responses of individuals who received the vaccine with those of HIV-negative individuals and patients with chronic HIV infection, including long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) who are able to control the virus.

The results showed that the vaccine recipients had readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses, which were significantly higher than those observed in HIV-negative controls. However, the magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations or the percentage of cytokine-secreting T-cells. Notably, the cytotoxic capacity of the CD8+ T-cells in vaccine recipients was significantly higher in individuals carrying the HLA class I alleles B*27, B*57, or B*58, which have been associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection.

These findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying protection from HIV infection and immune control over the virus, which is essential for the development of effective HIV vaccines.
Researchers have proposed that the evolution of modern human cognition was driven by the development of jointly intentional behavior, where individuals work together towards a common goal. A new study formally models the co-evolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid technological advancements are linked to the emergence of this ability. In the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. The study provides a unified explanation for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior. The emergence of shared intentions at a time of significant technological advance is consistent with evidence that composite tool manufacture and grammatical language evolved around the same time, approximately 300,000 years ago. The study models the evolution of the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior, showing under what conditions it is likely to emerge. The results suggest that the ability to share intentions and adjust strategies in tandem with others leads to faster convergence to improved technological norms, linking technology adoption to the evolution of collaboration.
Researchers have identified two microRNA loci, miR-34b/c and miR-449, that play a crucial role in male fertility. These microRNAs are highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and are involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis, the process by which sperm cells mature. A deficiency in these microRNAs has been linked to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology, which is the leading cause of male infertility in humans.

Studies in mice have shown that the deletion of both miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci results in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, with a significant reduction in sperm count, motility, and abnormal morphology. Histological analysis revealed a thinning of the epithelium within the seminiferous tubules and separation of spermatozoa heads and tails. The miR-34bc−/−;449−/− mice were infertile due to low sperm count and immotile, aberrant spermatozoa.

Further analysis revealed that the loss of miR-34b/c and miR-449 impairs both meiosis and the final stages of spermatozoa maturation. The deregulation of gene expression in miR-34bc−/−;449−/− spermatocytes highlights the importance of the microRNA pathway in fine-tuning gene expression during spermatogenesis. This study identifies the miR-34 family as the first functionally important microRNAs for spermatogenesis, whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the mechanisms behind its probiotic properties remain unclear. EcN produces two compounds, siderophore-microcins (Mcc) and the genotoxin colibactin, encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and potential pro-carcinogenic compound. Researchers aimed to separate EcN's antagonistic activity from its genotoxic activity. They found that the pks-encoded ClbP, a peptidase that activates colibactin, is necessary for EcN's antagonistic activity. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivated the genotoxic activity but maintained the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild-type strain. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
Researchers have identified two transporters, Uxt1 and Uxt2, that play a crucial role in the virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths annually due to meningitis. These transporters are essential for the incorporation of xylose, a neutral monosaccharide, into the polysaccharide capsule of the fungus. The capsule is a major virulence factor, acting as a physical barrier against host defenses and an immune modulator when shed into the extracellular space. The researchers found that Uxt1 and Uxt2 are specific for the xylose donor, UDP-xylose, and also transport the galactofuranose donor, UDP-galactofuranose. Both transporters are necessary for the fungus to cause disease in mice, although surprisingly, they are not required for fungal viability in the context of infection. This discovery provides a starting point for deciphering the substrate specificity of an important class of transporters and elucidates a synthetic pathway that may be productively targeted for therapy. The study contributes to our understanding of fundamental glycobiology and sheds light on the mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping, control, and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The database provides georeferenced data on NTDs, including schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and leishmaniasis, which can be used for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, and monitoring and surveillance. The database was created by systematically searching the literature and contacting Ministries of Health and research institutions in endemic countries for location-specific prevalence data and survey details. The data were extracted, georeferenced, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface allowing free access and data management. The database currently contains over 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries and is expanding to include other NTDs. The database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, and disease monitoring and surveillance. It also allows for detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time. The researchers demonstrate that the establishment and running of a global NTD database is feasible and should be expanded without delay. The database is available at http://www.gntd.org.
Researchers investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoidis sigmodontis. Chronic helminth infections typically induce a Th2 immune response, which can suppress Th1 immunity necessary for controlling MTB infection. However, the study found that chronic L. sigmodontis infection does not worsen MTB infection in cotton rats. Immunological responses, histological studies, and quantitative mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MTB challenge in cotton rats with and without chronic L. sigmodontis infection. The results showed that spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified protein derivative were similar between co-infected and MTB-only infected animals. Furthermore, MTB loads and the occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals compared to those infected with only MTB. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals. These findings suggest that chronic filaria infections do not exacerbate MTB infection in the cotton rat model. The study's results indicate that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control, but also suggest that worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases may not substantially increase the risk for infections.
Researchers have discovered that a specific ion channel, ppk23, plays a crucial role in the courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, also known as the common fruit fly. Ppk23 is a member of the DEG/ENaC family, which is one of the largest families of ion channels in Drosophila. The study found that ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of chemosensory bristles on the forelegs of male flies, which are distinct from those involved in feeding. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting its activity delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship behavior. Furthermore, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to a female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone. These findings suggest that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. The study indicates that DEG/ENaC signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors and reveals a novel physiological function for this important family of ion channels. The results also suggest that ppk23-expressing cells may play a role in intra-species interactions independent of sex, and further research is needed to explore this possibility. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying courtship behavior in Drosophila.
Researchers studied how mitochondria in the green alga Chlamydomonas import tRNAs from the cytosol to ensure proper mitochondrial translation. They found a precise correlation between the mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be a dynamic process that adapts to the mitochondrial genome content. To test this, the researchers manipulated the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage. They found that this modification resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and decreased levels and activities of respiratory complexes. This was linked to limitations in the pool of tRNAs in mitochondria, indicating that tRNA mitochondrial import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context. Instead, the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutionary adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The study suggests that codon bias has a direct effect on translation efficiency and that the information residing in the mitochondrial DNA defines the levels of imported tRNAs to allow optimal mitochondrial translation.
A new approach to understanding glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes has been developed using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Current methods for measuring blood glucose levels are limited by relying on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. Researchers used CGM to evaluate the frequency and patterns of postprandial glucose elevations in individuals with and without diabetes. The study found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. This suggests that glucose dysregulation is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought.

The researchers developed an analytical framework that groups individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, called "glucotypes." These glucotypes reveal subphenotypes within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. The study found that individuals with severe glycemic variability within the normoglycemic or prediabetic group had a higher risk of progression to diabetes. In fact, 25% of normoglycemic individuals exhibited severe glucose variability, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic or diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. The findings suggest that identifying individuals with severe glycemic variability could enhance the prediction of risk of progression to diabetes. The study also developed a webtool for visualizing individualized glucose patterns and classifying them into glucotypes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the EDR1 protein in regulating plant defense responses. EDR1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family and has been shown to negatively regulate plant defense responses and cell death. To understand how EDR1 functions, the researchers studied its interaction with other proteins in the MAP kinase cascade. They found that EDR1 physically interacts with the MKK4 and MKK5 proteins, which are part of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade. This interaction requires the N-terminal domain of EDR1. The researchers also found that EDR1 negatively affects the protein levels of MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6. In addition, they discovered that mutations in the MKK4 and MKK5 genes suppress the resistance mediated by EDR1, and overexpression of MKK4 or MKK5 causes EDR1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death. These findings suggest that EDR1 regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade to fine-tune plant innate immunity. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of plant defense responses and highlights the importance of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade in regulating plant immunity. The researchers also identified loss-of-function mutants of MKK4 and MKK5, which will be useful tools for studying the role of the MKK4/5 mediated MAPK cascade in biotic and abiotic stresses.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, using a method called Gaussian processes. This framework can identify complex patterns in disease data and make reliable predictions about future cases. The researchers tested their framework on data from Turkey between 2004 and 2015 and found that it outperformed two commonly used machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted regression trees, in predicting disease cases. The framework can be used to make predictions under three different scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction. Temporal prediction involves forecasting disease cases for future time periods, spatial prediction involves predicting disease cases for specific locations, and spatiotemporal prediction involves forecasting disease cases for specific locations and time periods. The researchers used a similarity matrix to combine data from different locations and time periods, and then trained a Gaussian process regression model to make predictions. This framework has the potential to help public health policymakers make informed decisions about disease control and prevention strategies. The results of this study suggest that Gaussian processes can capture complex dependencies in disease data better than traditional machine learning algorithms, making them a valuable tool for infectious disease modeling.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus among livestock in Africa and the Middle East. The model takes into account seasonal and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the spread of the disease. The study found that human activities, such as the Eid al-Adha festival, and climatic factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, play a significant role in the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. The model suggests that outbreaks may occur when there is a combination of abundant livestock in areas at risk and a large number of mosquitoes.

The researchers used a three-patch model to simulate the transmission dynamics of the disease over short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival period. The study also investigated the impact of festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, animal transportation speed, and death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. The results show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks increases, particularly in the area where the religious ceremony will be held.

The study's findings can help local governments predict and control the transmission of the disease pathogen. For example, an unexpected RVF outbreak in 2010 in northern Mauritania was attributed to a large number of camels and heavy rainfall. The model can provide information on how to effectively control the transmission of the disease and prevent outbreaks.
Researchers studied the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. They analyzed data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax cases during three periods: Soviet governance, post-Soviet governance, and preemptive livestock vaccination. The study found that human anthrax incidence increased by 11.95% from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35.24% after the introduction of livestock vaccination in 1996. The researchers also observed a shift in the geographic distribution of the disease, with cases initially concentrated in the west and later shifting eastward towards the capital, Baku.

The study revealed that the incidence of human cutaneous anthrax was more common in the west and south during the Soviet era, but shifted eastward in the mid-1990s. The disease remained primarily concentrated in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during the preemptive livestock vaccination period. The introduction of a comprehensive vaccination program in 1996 led to a significant decline in human anthrax cases. However, the study highlights the need for continued control measures in livestock to prevent the occurrence of the disease.

The findings suggest that the distribution of human anthrax in Azerbaijan has undergone significant changes over the past 27 years, consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases in the region. The study emphasizes the importance of an integrated "One Health" approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease.
Researchers have investigated the molecular interactions between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel. PUFAs are essential components of cell membrane phospholipids in heart cells and neurons, and have been found to shift the voltage dependence of the Shaker KV channel to enable channel activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which PUFAs modulate channel functioning remains unclear.

Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, researchers identified a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the Shaker KV channel, located at the protein-lipid interface near the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). The study found that the lipophilic PUFA tail interacts with the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group interacts with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices.

The researchers also compared the interactions between PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with the Shaker KV channel. They found that the polyunsaturated carbon tails of PUFAs exhibit increased conformational flexibility compared to saturated carbon chains, which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of PUFA interactions with the Shaker KV channel and may have implications for the development of treatments for refractory epilepsy using ketogenic diets.
Researchers have developed a pipeline to screen for antiparasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite responsible for significant disease burden in children in developing countries and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current treatments are ineffective, and the parasite's poor experimental tractability has hindered the discovery of new therapeutics. A unique enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), has been identified as a potential target, but testing inhibitors has been challenging. To overcome this hurdle, the researchers genetically engineered the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C. parvum infection. This allowed for the development of a screening pipeline that includes a fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay using automated high-content imaging analysis. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors and identified a subset of 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent in vivo selectivity and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. The researchers also developed a T. gondii reporter parasite that mirrors Cryptosporidium purine metabolism, allowing for a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and target specificity. This pipeline has been used to identify two promising candidates for anticryptosporidial chemotherapy, A103 and A110, which are more potent than the current standard treatment, paromomycin.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic factors influencing primary tooth development in infancy. The study analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The study found five genetic loci associated with the time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year of age, with a significance level of P<5×10−8. An additional five loci showed suggestive associations (P<5×10−6). The identified loci included genes linked to tooth and other organ development, such as KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Notably, genes at four of the identified loci are also implicated in cancer development. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years. The study's findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and may have implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes. The identified genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and mutations in three of these genes have been linked to altered organogenesis and development.
Researchers created two new mouse models, Ts3Yah and Ms3Yah, to study the effects of partial trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App region on chromosome 21, which is associated with Down syndrome. This region is responsible for various physiological abnormalities, including intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. The study found that trisomy and monosomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance in mice. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed changes in the regulation of genes involved in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. In Ts3Yah mice, these genes were downregulated, while in Ms3Yah mice, they were upregulated. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlated with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without altering respiratory function. However, the production of reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased. The study suggests that the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a result of changes in the dose of specific genes, including Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. The results indicate that the copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel, a type of ion channel that plays a crucial role in regulating heartbeat and neuronal excitability. The model reveals that the channel's basal and evoked activities are controlled by the unequal stoichiometry of Gα and Gβγ subunits. Basal activity, which occurs in the absence of neurotransmitter, is inversely related to the extent of activation by neurotransmitter. The model accurately recapitulates GIRK1/2 currents in various expression systems, including Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons. It also correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and accounts for the inverse correlation between basal and agonist-evoked activities.

The model suggests that between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while the number of available Gα subunits decreases as GIRK1/2 density increases. This unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits and the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by Gβγ underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities, allowing GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of GIRK1/2 function and regulation, which is essential for understanding the physiological roles of these channels in the heart and brain.
Researchers have developed a new computational model called PrediTALE to predict the target genes of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) in plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. TALEs are proteins secreted by the bacteria that activate specific genes in the host plant to facilitate infection. The new model, PrediTALE, takes into account recent findings on how TALEs bind to DNA and can identify potential virulence targets more accurately than previous approaches. By analyzing RNA-seq data from infected rice plants, the researchers found that PrediTALE improved prediction performance and identified several novel putative virulence targets. However, some TALEs were not predicted to target any genes, which the researchers term "orphan TALEs." They suggest that this may be due to incomplete gene annotations and propose using genome-wide scans to identify target boxes. The researchers demonstrated that genome-wide scans can recover known targets and identify new targets independent of existing gene annotations, including non-coding RNAs. They applied PrediTALE to five additional Xanthomonas species and their host plants and found that the known targets of these TALEs were ranked highly in the predictions. The study highlights the importance of accurate computational predictions of TALE target boxes for understanding the virulence mechanisms of plant-pathogenic bacteria.
Researchers have developed a new machine-learning algorithm called APOGEE to assess the functional impact of non-synonymous genome variations in human mitochondrial DNA. Non-synonymous variations are changes in the DNA sequence that result in a different amino acid being incorporated into a protein. These changes can potentially affect the function of the protein and the overall health of the cell. However, evaluating the pathogenicity of these variations is a challenging task, especially in the mitochondrial DNA, which is less studied than the nuclear DNA.

APOGEE was trained on a dataset of 864 known mitochondrial variants and outperformed existing prediction methods in estimating the harmfulness of these variations. The algorithm uses a classification model based on the Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and feeds third-party predictors with features related to the 13 mitochondrial proteins, such as multi-alignments and amino acid conservation estimates. The algorithm's reasoning strategy was tuned on finely curated training sets of variations, and its predicting model was based on decision tree learning to provide interpretable rules of pathogenicity.

APOGEE's performance was evaluated on a test set of variants, and its predictions were compared to those of existing prediction methods. The results showed that APOGEE outperformed these methods in estimating the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations. The algorithm's performance metrics, such as accuracy and precision, were calculated and reported in a table. Additionally, the frequency of coevolving amino acids and the mean MI Z-score for each amino acid site were computed for all 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes potentially affecting the human mitochondrial DNA and made freely available.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a range of diseases, from mild dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, or low platelet count, is a major characteristic of both mild and severe dengue disease and is correlated with disease severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cause endothelial leakage. However, it was unclear whether DENV NS1 can directly induce platelet activation or cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection.

This study found that DENV, but not Zika virus, cell culture supernatant can induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and these effects were blocked by anti-NS1, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist, and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. The activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages.

The study also found that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. These results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during DENV infection.
Researchers conducted a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops that regulate blood pressure and blood volume in the body. The study focused on the interactions between three key systems: the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These systems play a crucial role in maintaining long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters.

The analysis revealed that the AVP-ANP-RAAS system consists of two regulatory mechanisms that perform the same function: one affects blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction, and the other affects blood volume. Both mechanisms are candidate oscillators, meaning they can exhibit stable or oscillatory behavior. The study also identified a subsystem that includes ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a candidate oscillator composed of multiple negative feedback loops.

The results suggest that the physiological mechanisms regulating long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The study used mathematical tools to analyze the AVP-ANP-RAAS endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure, highlighting the loop arrangement and its dynamic function. The findings provide insight into the complex interactions between these systems and their role in maintaining blood pressure and blood volume homeostasis.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism that regulates thrombus growth, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study focused on the role of fibrin networks, a component of thrombi, in controlling protein transport. Experiments and model simulations revealed that the permeability and diffusivity of the fibrin network are crucial factors in determining the transport of proteins through the network. The researchers found that the fibrin network, also known as the fibrin cap, limits the exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin, a key activator of platelets and fibrin polymerization. By restricting the approach of resting platelets to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap prevents platelet activation and limits thrombus growth. The study suggests that the formation of a fibrin cap prevents small, asymptomatic thrombi from developing into life-threatening events. Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus is washed downstream through the fibrin network, further limiting thrombus growth. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of thrombus development and highlight the importance of spatial distributions of hemostatic activators in regulating thrombogenesis. The study's results complement recent research on thrombus development and emphasize the role of fibrin networks in controlling protein transport and thrombus growth.
Researchers investigated how invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that iNKT cells produce a protein called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. This is a novel mechanism of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity. In contrast, conventional markers of iNKT cell activation, such as CD25 upregulation and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production, were not required for iNKT cell control of Mtb. These markers were primarily driven by interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. However, blocking these cytokine signals had little effect on iNKT cell control of Mtb growth. The researchers also found that iNKT cell control of Mtb was independent of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The study used a co-culture system of iNKT cells and Mtb-infected macrophages to investigate the direct antimicrobial effector function of iNKT cells. The results suggest that GM-CSF is a key mediator of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity and may play a role in T cell immunity against Mtb.
Researchers studied how the fungus Candida albicans, a common inhabitant of the human gut, regulates its population size during colonization. They found that the EFH1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in this process. When EFH1 is highly expressed, Candida albicans colonizes the intestinal tract less effectively, while its absence or overexpression leads to increased colonization. This suggests that EFH1 helps to regulate the balance between commensalism, where the fungus coexists with the host, and candidiasis, a condition where the fungus causes disease. The study also found that different genes are required for colonization in different host niches, such as the gut and oral cavity, and that the pathways that regulate gene expression during host colonization can differ from those used during laboratory growth. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that EFH1 does not affect the virulence of Candida albicans in a disseminated infection model or its cellular physiology under laboratory conditions. Overall, the study highlights the importance of EFH1 in regulating the population size of Candida albicans during colonization and sheds light on the complex interactions between the fungus and its host.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is a highly effective approach against liver stages of the malaria parasite, but the mechanisms behind its success are not well understood. Researchers have discovered that prolonged antigen presentation is crucial for the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses against malaria liver stages. Using a model of immunization with irradiated sporozoites, the study found that the malaria circumsporozoite protein, a leading vaccine candidate, persists in the body for over 8 weeks after immunization. This persistent antigen is detected in lymphoid organs and relies on the presence of CD11c+ cells.

The study showed that prolonged antigen presentation enhances the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time that primed CD8+ T cells are exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduces the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expand in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naive animals. Finally, persisting antigen is able to prime naive cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver.

These findings suggest that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages depends on the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen. The study's results have significant implications for the development of a practical and effective vaccine against malaria.
Researchers have explored the potential of polymyxin B (polB) as a treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. To improve the delivery of polB, scientists created biodegradable nanocarriers coated with polB, called PBCAnp-polB. These nanocarriers were designed to enhance the internalization of polB in infected macrophages, cells that play a key role in the immune response.

The PBCAnp-polB nanocarriers had a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm and were stable for at least 45 days. The nanocarriers released polB at a slower rate than the free drug, which is beneficial for a prolonged and sustained release profile. In vitro tests showed that polB alone had limited leishmanicidal activity, but the PBCAnp-polB nanocarriers demonstrated significant leishmanicidal activity, surpassing the activity of free polB. The nanocarriers also exhibited antimicrobial activity against certain bacteria, including E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella.

The results suggest that the PBCAnp-polB nanocarriers could be a promising treatment for leishmaniasis, particularly in cases where secondary bacterial infections are present. The sustained release of polB from the nanocarriers could help prevent the development of parasite resistance and reduce the need for hospitalization. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach.
A study in Brazil investigated the factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the intracellular protozoan Leishmania infantum. The study analyzed data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health's Reportable Disease Information System (SINAN) for the period 2002-2009. The analysis identified several factors associated with a higher risk of death from VL, including weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, age 60 years or older, bleeding, jaundice, and other associated infections. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have also identified age, jaundice, bleeding, and co-morbidities as risk factors for death from VL.

The study developed a prognostic score using the variables associated with death from VL, which was evaluated for its predictive performance. The score showed a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 73.7%, positive predictive value of 28.9%, and negative predictive value of 94.5%. The study suggests that knowledge of these factors associated with death from VL can improve clinical management of patients and contribute to lower mortality.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a significant public health problem, with an estimated 500,000 new cases and over 50,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is most commonly found in six countries, including Brazil, where the study was conducted. The study's findings highlight the need for improved clinical management and treatment of VL, particularly in high-risk populations such as those with Leishmania-HIV co-infection.
Researchers have identified a novel allele of the Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1, called bak1-5, which differentially regulates plant growth, cell death, and innate immunity. The study found that bak1-5 mutant plants are severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent receptor kinases FLS2 and EFR, but not in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling or cell death control. In contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. However, kinase activity is not required for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 requires BAK1-5 kinase activity, indicating a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by BAK1. The study reveals key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD receptor kinases. The results also show that the interaction of EFR and FLS2 with BAK1 is a requirement rather than a consequence of detectable phosphorylation, and that BAK1 dictates the specificity of downstream signaling.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cancer cells respond to anticancer treatments. Current methods do not fully capture the complexity of this response, which involves multiple cell cycle phases and generations. The new approach combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to create a computer model of the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment.

The model includes modules that describe the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. This framework allows researchers to apply different types of modules in each phase and test models at various levels of complexity. The method was tested using X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy.

The resulting model provided a complete rendering of the cell cycle process following X-ray exposure, giving separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This model reconciles known effects of ionizing radiation and provides new insights into the response of cancer cells to treatment. The method enables a detailed study of the mechanisms contributing to the response to anticancer treatment at the cell population level, accounting for inter-cell variability.

The model was built by combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting simultaneously all data from different doses and platforms. The final model gave a dynamic rendering of the flow of cells through the phases of the cell cycle and through subsequent generations, for controls and each X-ray dose.
Researchers have identified a link between a genetic mutation in the Pdss2 gene and isolated renal disease in mice. The Pdss2 gene plays a crucial role in the production of coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain. Mice with a missense mutation in the Pdss2 gene (Pdss2kd/kd) exhibited significantly lower levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in their kidneys compared to control mice. This CoQ deficiency led to renal disease, specifically affecting glomerular podocytes, which are specialized cells in the kidneys responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. The disease manifestations in the Pdss2kd/kd mice were characterized by tubular dilatation and interstitial nephritis, which are hallmarks of kidney damage.

The researchers also found that knocking out the Pdss2 gene specifically in podocytes resulted in a more severe phenotype than mice homozygous for the Pdss2kd mutation, suggesting that the product of the missense allele retains some residual activity. The study suggests that the disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency are related to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes being the most sensitive to Pdss2 impairment. Furthermore, the researchers found that the inflammatory response in the kidneys is not the primary cause of the disease, but rather a mechanism used to collect and dispose of cellular debris. This study provides new insights into the relationship between CoQ deficiency and renal disease, and highlights the importance of tissue-specific CoQ biosynthesis in maintaining normal kidney function.
Biologists have long recognized the importance of phenotypic robustness, the ability of living organisms to maintain their form and function despite environmental and genetic disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins of this trait are not well understood. Researchers have investigated the determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome, finding that these lineages are robust to cell deaths and other disturbances. This robustness is due to several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types. These features allow the organisms to maintain their cellular composition despite cell deaths and other disturbances. The researchers used computational simulations to demonstrate that this robustness may have arisen as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This study reveals a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness that operates at the supracellular level, distinct from previously studied mechanisms that act at the subcellular or cellular levels. This mechanism is particularly important for species with predominantly determinative development, where cell fate is largely fixed. The study also provides a novel explanation for the contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robustness and suggests that cell lineage robustness complements other mechanisms of robustness to form a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic perturbations.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhenomics to study the development of aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an open-source video microscope called OpenVIM, which captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled environmental conditions. The videos are then analyzed by a Python package called Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV), which extracts data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development.

The EmbryoPhenomics platform was tested on over 30 million images of more than 600 embryos from two species, the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. The platform was able to extract phenomic data from 95% of the images, providing high-dimensional data on embryo responses to environmental changes such as temperature and salinity.

The researchers demonstrated the versatility of EmbryoPhenomics by applying it to a range of experimental designs, from 2-week to 24-hour experiments. They also showed that the platform can capture short-term changes in physiology and behavior, such as heart rate and movement patterns. The data generated by EmbryoPhenomics is comparable in scale, diversity, and quality to that produced by molecular-omic technologies, making it a valuable tool for studying embryonic development and phenomics. The platform has the potential to revolutionize the study of development and phenomics, particularly in the context of environmental change.
Malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium spp., undergo significant changes in their metabolism as they transition between different stages of their life cycle in the mosquito and human hosts. Researchers have used stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to study the metabolic changes in Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria parasite. The study found that the parasite's metabolism shifts from a glycolytic metabolism in the asexual blood stages to a dependence on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in the mosquito stages.

The researchers discovered that glutamine serves as the primary input into TCA metabolism in both asexual and sexual blood stages, and is essential for complete male gametogenesis. Additionally, glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are crucial for the transition from ookinete to oocyst in the mosquito. These findings highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species that are not apparent from genomic or transcriptomic studies.

The study's results suggest that targeting the TCA cycle and electron transport chain could be an effective strategy for blocking malaria transmission. The researchers also found that the parasite's metabolic changes are not solely driven by the availability of specific carbon sources in the mosquito niches, but rather by other factors. These findings have implications for the development of transmission-blocking interventions and highlight the importance of integrating metabolomics data with other platforms to inform drug discovery and design.
Researchers have identified a common motif in biological signaling pathways, known as the incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), which enables cells to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals. This motif is found in various biological processes, including the development of amoebas and the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. The IFFL consists of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output, allowing the system to exhibit temporal adaptation and distinguish between input signals with varying temporal profiles.

Quantitative modeling has revealed that IFFLs can process oscillatory signals, but their ability to do so is limited by two constraints. The kinetics of the IFFL components dictate the input range for which the network can decode pulsatile dynamics, and a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal "counting" of oscillatory signals. The researchers found that the IFFL's ability to respond to transient signals but not sustained signals relies on the property of temporal adaptation in response to a sustained signal.

The study highlights the unique ability of IFFLs with proper network parameters to distinguish between transient and sustained signals, making them ideal for decoding oscillatory signals. The common occurrence of IFFLs in biological networks suggests a role in processing transient or oscillatory signals, and the findings have implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for this purpose.
Researchers have developed improved methods for quantifying, propagating, purifying, and storing Orientia tsutsugamushi, the bacterium responsible for scrub typhus, a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. This bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen that can only be cultured in mammalian cells, making it difficult to study. To address this challenge, the researchers created a standardized method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions. They used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to measure bacterial growth in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The optimized growth assay allowed for the comparison of bacterial growth across different conditions, which will be useful for future research on this pathogen. The researchers also developed a method for quantifying O. tsutsugamushi levels by extracting total DNA and measuring the exact genome copy number using a primer/probe set specific to a short region within the O. tsutsugamushi 47kDa Htra single-copy gene. These improved methods will aid in the study of O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens, such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families, and will be useful for improving clinical isolation rates and performing in vitro cell biology experiments.
Researchers investigated the safety and effectiveness of the antihelminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the Schistosoma haematobium worm, which is typically treated with PZQ. However, children under 5 years old have been excluded from schistosomiasis control programs due to a lack of safety data on PZQ in this age group. The study involved 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 years who were treated with PZQ tablets, and their caregivers reported any side effects within 24 hours of treatment. The researchers found that 3.8% of the children experienced side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body. Six weeks after treatment, the study found that PZQ significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in the children, with an egg reduction rate of 99% and a cure rate of 92%. These results were comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in children aged 6-10 years. The study suggests that PZQ is safe and effective in treating schistosomiasis in children as young as 1-5 years old, and supports the inclusion of pre-school children and infants in schistosomiasis control programs.
Researchers have identified a new gene, Tetraspanin 29Fb, that plays a crucial role in suppressing the growth and spread of cancer cells driven by mutations in the Ras gene. Ras mutations are found in about 30% of human cancers, but on their own, they are not enough to cause cancer to develop. To find other genes that work with Ras to cause cancer, scientists used a high-throughput screening method in fruit flies (Drosophila) that allowed them to test thousands of genes for their role in cancer development. This method, called RNAi-mediated knockdown, allowed the researchers to silence specific genes in the flies and observe the effects on cancer development.

The study identified 80 genes that, when silenced, led to increased cancer growth and spread in the flies. Many of these genes were already known to be involved in cancer, but several were new discoveries. The researchers found that the human versions of these genes were often downregulated (turned off) in thousands of human tumors, suggesting that they may be useful as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. One of the top hits, Tetraspanin 29Fb, was further studied and found to regulate the activity of the EGFR signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth and division. Silencing Tetraspanin 29Fb in the flies led to increased tumor growth and invasion, suggesting that it acts as a tumor suppressor. The study's findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms of cancer development and may lead to the identification of new targets for cancer therapy.
Researchers have identified a new gene, wtf13, in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that acts as a meiotic driver. Meiotic drivers are genes that manipulate the reproductive process to increase their own transmission to offspring, often at the expense of other genes. Wtf13 achieves this by producing a poison that kills spores that do not inherit it, while also producing an antidote that rescues spores that inherit the gene. However, another gene, wtf18-2, has been found to suppress the drive of wtf13 by mimicking the antidote produced by wtf13. This means that wtf18-2 only rescues spores that inherit it, allowing it to selfishly gain a transmission advantage while reducing the drive of wtf13. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms and evolution of meiotic drive systems. It also challenges the prevailing hypothesis that suppressors of killer meiotic drivers work by indiscriminately rescuing all gametes. Instead, wtf18-2 acts specifically to protect spores that inherit it from the poison produced by wtf13. The researchers suggest that this mechanism may have evolved from an ancestral gene that was a dual-transcript poison-antidote meiotic driver, which was duplicated and selected for its ability to cause drive and protect spores. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between meiotic drivers and their suppressors.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that can accurately predict differences in gene expression among human individuals based solely on their genetic information. The algorithm uses data from multiple genetic variants, or SNPs, in the vicinity of the predicted gene to make predictions. Notably, the algorithm performs well even when trained on data from one population and tested on individuals from a different population. This suggests that some genetic variants are shared across populations and can be used to make predictions about gene expression.

The algorithm was tested on a set of genes and found to be robust in its predictions, agreeing well between the training and test sets. The researchers also found that genes that were successfully predicted had higher expression levels and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of genes that can be predicted from their genetic variation.

To improve the algorithm's performance, the researchers developed an extension that incorporates different types of genomic annotations to weigh the importance of various genetic variants. By assigning higher weights to variants with specific annotations, such as proximity to genes or high regional G/C content, the algorithm was able to make more accurate predictions.

The ability to predict gene expression changes among individuals based on their genetic sequence variation has important implications for understanding the susceptibility to different diseases and phenotypes. The researchers' algorithm provides a valuable tool for identifying genetic variants associated with gene expression changes, which can inform the development of new treatments and therapies.
Researchers investigated the competitive interactions between two strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi in mice. They used mathematical models to analyze data from experiments where mice were infected with both a virulent and an avirulent strain of the parasite. The study aimed to determine the cause of competitive suppression, where the virulent strain outcompetes the avirulent strain. The researchers tested several possible explanations, including differences in the adaptive immune response, background loss of parasites, red blood cell age preference, infection rate, burst size, and within-red blood cell interference. They found that only one parameter, the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature red blood cells, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This parameter was the same for both strains in single-clone infections but different in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immunocompetent mice and smallest in immunodeficient mice, which explains why competitive suppression was alleviated in immunodeficient mice. The study suggests that the innate immune response, which clears merozoites, is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones. The results also indicate that there may be an interaction between the clones and the innate immune response that induces changes in the strength of its clearance of merozoites.
Researchers have proposed a new model, called Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA), to explain the formation of inverted triplications, a type of copy number variation (CNV) in the genome. This model suggests that a replication error at short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. This intermediate then integrates into the genome, creating an inverted triplication without losing distal chromosomal sequences.

To test the ODIRA model, scientists used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, where leading and lagging nascent strands are ligated to create "closed" forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. The removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid. This plasmid then integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication.

The ODIRA model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons, which have a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent. This feature is readily explained by a plasmid intermediate that arises from one homologue and integrates into the other homologue prior to meiosis. The tests of key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest further avenues of enquiry to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs pivotal in human health and evolution.
Researchers have investigated how influenza virus infection affects translation initiation in human cells. Translation initiation is the process by which cells start making proteins from genetic instructions. The study found that influenza virus infection alters the sites where translation initiation occurs, leading to the production of novel immune epitopes. The researchers used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to examine translation initiation in human lung epithelial cells infected with influenza virus. They identified several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, including one that results in a truncated version of the N1 neuraminidase protein. This truncated protein is expressed on the cell surface during infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. The study also found that the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites. The researchers did not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response. The study provides the first comprehensive analysis of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and sheds light on the evolutionary forces shaping this process. The findings suggest that the influenza virus has adapted to mammalian hosts by selecting against non-canonical translation initiation at CUG codons.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne disease, resulting in significant economic and health burdens. EHEC can lead to severe bloody diarrhea and potentially fatal kidney disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome, for which there is no effective treatment or prevention. To cause disease, EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins, or effectors, into host cells. These effectors subvert host cell function to promote diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. However, the mechanisms by which these effectors bind to host proteins and disrupt normal intestinal epithelial cell function are not fully understood.

Researchers have identified two EHEC effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, which bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of the NF-κB transcriptional complex. NleH1 and NleH2 interact with RPS3 in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus. The N-terminal region of both NleH1 and NleH2 is required for binding to the N-terminus of RPS3. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduces the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without affecting other NF-κB subunits or the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 represses the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, while NleH2 stimulates RPS3-dependent transcription. A region of NleH1 (N40-K45) is responsible for the inhibitory activity of NleH1 toward RPS3. Deletion of nleH1 from E. coli O157:H7 results in a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection.
Researchers have developed a new method for modeling the interactions between proteins and DNA, called feature motif models (FMMs). This approach is an improvement over the current dominant model, the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which assumes that each position in the DNA sequence is independent of the others. FMMs, on the other hand, can capture complex relationships between positions and other high-level features, such as palindromes. The new method uses log-linear models to represent the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) and can learn these features from both aligned and unaligned input sequences.

The researchers developed an algorithm for learning the structural features of FMMs from binding site data and a discriminative motif finder that discovers de novo FMMs enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. They evaluated their approach on synthetic data and the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. The results showed that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs.

The researchers applied their algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human and revealed sequence features present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. They also showed that FMMs learn the binding specificities of these TFs better than PSSMs. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available online. This new approach has the potential to improve our understanding of TF-DNA interactions and may be integrated into state-of-the-art motif finding algorithms.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees. They focused on the adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C), an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout mice for this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral changes associated with the fight-or-flight response. The researchers found that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. They identified a cis-regulatory region near the ADRA2C gene that has undergone significant evolutionary changes in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each with a polymorphism. The derived alleles of these polymorphisms have reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in bonobos or macaques. The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays to show that these derived alleles repress ADRA2C expression by increasing NRSF binding. They also detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. The study suggests that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
Researchers have studied the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that allows plants to increase productivity in tropical and subtropical areas by up to 50%. This trait has evolved independently in at least 60 different plant lineages, including both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. To understand how these separate lineages use the same genetic networks to maintain C4 photosynthesis, scientists developed a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. They applied this framework to two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, whose last common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago. The study identified a cohort of 3,335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. The researchers found that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes, and that homologous transcription factors are used to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain cell-specific gene expression in both species. A core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation was also identified, which is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of monocotyledons and dicotyledons. The study demonstrates that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insights into the molecular convergence of complex phenotypes, and that parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis. This knowledge can be used to identify regulators of complex traits and engineer the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
Researchers studied a healthcare worker infected with the Ebola virus (EBOV) in Sierra Leone to better understand how the virus behaves in the body. They collected samples from the patient's upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as from their plasma, over several days. The team found that even after the virus had cleared from the patient's plasma, viral RNA was still present in the lower respiratory tract. This suggests that the virus may be replicating locally in the lungs, rather than just being present due to spill-over from the plasma. The presence of both positive and negative sense RNA in the respiratory tract, but not in the plasma, supports this idea. Positive sense RNA is a sign of active viral replication, while negative sense RNA is a precursor to replication. The study's findings are consistent with a recent review of post-mortem examinations of Ebola patients, which found evidence of viral replication in the respiratory tract. These results have important implications for understanding how Ebola is transmitted between people and for developing effective intervention strategies. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of viral replication and shedding in the respiratory tract.
Researchers investigated the role of different domains of the glycoprotein (GPC) from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of Junin virus (JUNV) in attenuating Machupo virus (MACV), a New World arenavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. They created recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing the GPC from Cd#1 and found it to be completely attenuated in a murine model and protective against lethal MACV challenge. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPC, equivalent to the attenuating mutation in Cd#1 GPC, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUNV. To further investigate, the researchers created rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC alone (MCg1), with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All rMACVs showed similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMACV, while MCg2 and MCg3 were completely attenuated and induced neutralizing antibodies against Cd#1. The results suggest that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC plays a crucial role in the attenuation of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, although the ectodomain alone is not sufficient for complete attenuation. These findings have implications for the development of vaccine candidates for MACV and other New World arenaviruses.
Researchers have discovered that specific point mutations in the centromeric histone 3 variant (CENH3) can cause post-zygotic incompatibility and uniparental inheritance in plants. CENH3 is essential for the proper segregation of sister chromatids during cell division. By introducing single amino acid changes in conserved residues of the histone fold domain of CENH3 in Arabidopsis plants, the researchers found that many of the mutant lines displayed normal growth and fertility when self-pollinated, but exhibited frequent post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This phenomenon is similar to the genome elimination syndromes observed in chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species.

The study suggests that a single point mutation in the histone fold domain of CENH3 is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, which can be used to identify non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species. The researchers identified an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution in the histone fold domain, which produced post-zygotic death and uniparental haploids when crossed with wild-type plants. The study also found that centromeres determined by point mutations in CENH3 specify efficient chromosome inheritance in self-crosses, but lead to missegregation in F1 hybrids when confronted with centromeres determined by the wild-type CENH3.
Researchers have investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple proteins with different functions. The study used a modified hESC line that allowed for the selection of pluripotent hESCs and cardiac progenitors. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were analyzed to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns.

The results showed that splice events for these groups corresponded to pathways involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control. The study also identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These changes included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors.

The researchers used a new program called AltAnalyze to analyze the data and identified 50 alternative exons with a cardiac-specific or common cardiac/neural differentiation pattern. These results suggest that alternative splicing plays a role in the direct specification of cardiac precursors. The study also found that the loss of pluripotency corresponds to alternative splicing of genes that regulate transcription, cell-cell contact formation, and metabolism, while cardiac-enriched events favor contractile pathways, inhibition of neurogenesis, and Wnt signaling.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) as a potential target for developing antimicrobials against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). T6P is a key molecule in the biosynthesis of trehalose, a sugar that is essential for the growth and survival of M. tuberculosis. To investigate the potential of T6P phosphatase as a drug target, scientists created a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allowed them to regulate the expression of the otsB2 gene, which encodes T6P phosphatase. They found that otsB2 is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in laboratory cultures and during the acute phase of infection in mice. However, during the chronic phase of infection, otsB2 is not essential, suggesting that M. tuberculosis remodels its trehalose metabolism in response to the host environment. The researchers discovered that blocking otsB2 leads to the accumulation of T6P, which is toxic to the bacteria, causing self-poisoning. They also found that blocking T6P production in a mutant lacking the T6P synthase gene (otsA) abolished the essentiality of otsB2. Furthermore, they identified over 800 genes that are upregulated in response to T6P accumulation, which may be due to increased RNA stability. This study highlights the potential of targeting T6P phosphatase as a strategy for developing new antimicrobials against M. tuberculosis.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which affects 11-18 million people worldwide. The parasite's proline racemase enzyme, TcPR, has been found to be essential for the parasite's survival and immune system evasion. Conformational changes in TcPR are believed to expose critical residues that trigger a host mitogenic B-cell response, contributing to the parasite's persistence.

To study these conformational changes, researchers used advanced molecular dynamics simulations to extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions of functional relevance. The simulations revealed potential conformational epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified transient binding pockets. The results showed that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are likely associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes around these binding pockets.

The study provides new insights into the function of TcPR and its role in the parasite's immune system evasion. The findings suggest that targeting TcPR could be a promising approach for developing new treatments for Chagas' disease. Current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles, particularly in the late stages of the disease. The identification of TcPR as a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention is an important step towards developing more effective treatments for this life-threatening illness.
Researchers have developed a new method for controlling gene expression in mice, allowing for reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue. This system, called iKO, enables scientists to turn genes on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. The iKO system consists of two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. This locus provides low basal expression and high inducibility, allowing for precise control over gene expression.

The iKO system has been successfully applied to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, allowing for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.

The iKO system offers several advantages over existing inducible gene expression approaches, including reversibility, high efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It allows for streamlined production of both KO and TIGRE mice, making it possible to generate iKOs for a large number of genes in a cost-effective manner. The system also provides flexibility, as KO and TIGRE lines can be engineered independently and combined in numerous ways, making a wide range of applications possible.
Researchers studied the genetic response of the placenta to infection with two different strains of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. The study used a mouse model to compare the effects of infection with the K98 and VD strains on the placental environment. The results showed that both strains caused changes in gene expression, but the VD strain had a stronger impact on the placenta. The VD strain was found to have a higher tropism, or affinity, for the placenta and caused a stronger immune response, which may help prevent congenital transmission of the parasite. In contrast, the K98 strain had a milder effect on the placenta. The study used a combination of microarray analysis and biological network analysis to identify the genes and pathways affected by the infection. The results suggest that the placental environment responds differently to different genotypes of T. cruzi, and that this response may play a role in controlling the infection and preventing congenital transmission. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of T. cruzi infection and may have implications for the development of new treatments for Chagas disease. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the genetic response of the placenta to infection in order to prevent congenital transmission of the parasite.
Researchers studied the prevalence of Sindbis virus (SINV) in mosquito vectors in central Sweden to identify an objective signal for outbreaks of the virus, which causes polyarthritis and rash, known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. The virus is typically found in tropical and sub-tropical countries, but in northern Europe, it is thought to cause recurring outbreaks every seven years. The researchers collected mosquitoes from the River Dalälven floodplains before, during, and after the hypothesized 2002 outbreak year and tested them for the virus. They found a significant increase in SINV prevalence in both enzootic and bridge-vector mosquitoes in 2002, with infection rates of 10.0/1000 in enzootic vectors and 0.62/1000 in bridge-vectors. Sequence analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I) and showed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years. The study suggests that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes is the most valuable outbreak marker for further investigation of the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks. The findings provide the first objective markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe. The researchers also found that the increased SINV-I activity in vector mosquitoes in 2002 and 2009 coincided with the hypothesized seven-year reoccurrence of outbreaks, and the higher SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes during these years was mirrored in a sharply increased SINV antibody prevalence in the main amplifying host population.
Researchers investigated how the locust olfactory system encodes and processes sensory information. They focused on the interaction between the antennal lobe (AL) and the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. Recordings from the MB showed that only a few Kenyon cells (KCs) responded reliably to specific odors, while different odors activated different KCs. To understand how this specificity is achieved, the researchers developed a biologically plausible model of the AL-MB connection. They found that activity-dependent plasticity at the synapses between the AL and MB efficiently regulates the tuning of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. This plasticity drives the specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations in the MB. The study suggests that plasticity plays a crucial role in information processing and makes a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses. The locust olfactory system is a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of neural coding strategies with plasticity and learning mechanisms. The researchers' findings are consistent with recent experimental results supporting a pre-synaptic mechanism of plasticity between KCs and mushroom body extrinsic neurons as a critical process in olfactory memory.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Researchers analyzed transcriptional profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and unaffected arterial wall, from 278 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The analysis revealed 60 tissue clusters, with two clusters in atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat segregating patients into groups based on the extent of coronary stenosis. These clusters were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles, with 27 genes confirmed to be associated with coronary stenosis. A gene module, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), was identified, which included genes involved in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway. The A-module was found to be genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold and was active in both atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module. Subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2-deficient arterial wall supported this notion. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis development and, together with LDB2, merits further attention in CAD research.
Researchers have identified a two-loop transcriptional feedback mechanism in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, specifically in the model organism Synechococcus. The KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock, undergoes different phospho-states during the day, but it was unclear which state promotes or suppresses the transcription of its own gene, kaiBC. A new model, called the TTFL/PTO model, combines a post-translational oscillator with a transcriptional/translational feedback loop to explain the regulation of kaiBC expression. The model suggests that threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. This two-loop feedback mechanism is able to reproduce existing experimental observations, including the effects of knocking out or overexpressing kai genes. The model also suggests that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression determines how the circadian clock responds to changes in kai gene expression. This study provides new insights into the regulation of the cyanobacterial circadian clock and has parallels with two-loop feedback structures found in the mammalian clock. The TTFL/PTO model can help explain how the KaiC protein controls the expression of hundreds of rhythmically regulated genes in the cyanobacterial genome.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals with a poorly productive HIV-2 infection and slow or absent disease progression. They found that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from those of HIV-1 in several ways. Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 does not infect monocytes, and its reservoirs are predominantly found in transitional-memory CD4 T-cells (TTM) rather than central-memory CD4 T-cells (TCM). This distribution is associated with lower expression of the CXCR6 co-receptor and higher expression of the restriction factor TRIM5 in TCM. The study also found that HIV-2 DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) positively correlated with those in TTM, but not TCM. Reactivation of HIV-2 was observed in cells from only three individuals. The study suggests that HIV-2 may be less adapted to human central-memory CD4 T-cells than to transitional-memory ones. The findings provide new insights into the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection and shed light on the mechanisms underlying attenuated HIV/SIV infection models. Overall, the study highlights the unique characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs and their differences from those of HIV-1.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) to explain how selective attention works in the brain. This model provides a mechanistic description of how attention affects the activity and selectivity of neurons in the cortex. Unlike previous models, ARC is implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons and maps the computations for selective attentional processing to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The model is able to simulate three studies of attention in macaques and quantitatively matches several observed forms of attentional modulation. These include shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features, and changes in contrast-response functions.

The ARC model predicts that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions. It also predicts that the different forms of attentional modulation are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attentional routing. The model demonstrates the biological plausibility of these predictions by presenting a spiking neuron implementation that accounts for five forms of attentional effect. Additionally, the ARC model predicts that an increasing proportion of neurons at each higher cortical level will show attentional modulation, with the magnitude of modulation increasing in higher cortical areas. Overall, the ARC model provides a unified explanation of selective attentional processing in the cortex and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions that can be tested experimentally.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic factors contributing to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and heritable arrhythmia. They analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from four population-based cohorts. The study aimed to identify coding genetic variants associated with AF susceptibility. After adjusting for multiple testing, none of the 99,404 common variants evaluated were significantly associated with AF. However, a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene (rs3812629) was found to be significantly associated with AF, with an odds ratio of 1.27. This variant lies at a known AF susceptibility locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a top marker from prior analyses at the locus. The study did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Furthermore, individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. The results suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. The study highlights the need for larger sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF. The findings are consistent with other whole exome sequencing efforts of complex diseases, such as coronary disease and diabetes, which have not identified coding variation as the major mechanisms underlying these conditions.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) were detected in Poland. The disease, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is a serious health threat in the Northern Hemisphere. The majority of cases, 83 (68.6%), were confirmed, 16 were probable, and 22 were possible. The age range of patients at diagnosis was 6-82 years, with a mean age of 47.7 years. The disease was fatal in 23 (19%) patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. The liver was the primary location of AE in all cases, and in 30 (24.8%) patients, the disease had spread to other organs. Most patients, 94, were treated with albendazole, and 73 (60%) underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplantations. The study found that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, with a continuous increase in detection rate over the past two decades. The disease is most prevalent in north-eastern Poland, where a family agglomeration of AE was found in four foci involving nine patients. The study highlights the need for a wider national program to implement screening in high-risk areas and increase public awareness of the risk of contracting E. multilocularis, as well as training primary care physicians to recognize the risk of AE for early detection.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli to understand how microorganisms respond to changes in zinc availability. The study found that Zur represses gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences in a highly cooperative manner, encircling the core element of each regulated promoter. This cooperative binding is facilitated by a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between arginine and aspartic acid residues.

The researchers solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and identified a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. However, the pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur-regulon promoters.

The study also found a 10,000-fold variation in Zur-DNA binding constants across four Zur-regulon promoters, which correlates with the degree of Zur repression observed in vivo. This suggests that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly, and the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. The findings provide insights into how zinc availability and partial metal occupancy at a subset of the eight zinc binding sites in the repressor complex can fine-tune stress-responsive gene expression across a range of promoters.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that affects ruminants, causing high morbidity and mortality. In 2008-2009, a large outbreak of RVF occurred on the island of Madagascar, including the Anjozorobe district in the highlands. Despite unfavorable climatic conditions for mosquito proliferation, a three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle revealed a recurrent circulation of the RVF virus (RVFV). To understand the key determinants of this unexpected transmission, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with a cattle trade network was developed and parameterized using observational data from the area. Three scenarios were analyzed: RVFV overwintering due to direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, a low-level vector-based circulation during winter, and a combination of both mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods selected a model that incorporated both a low-level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. This model satisfactorily reproduced field observations, attributing 84% of cattle infections to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. The study suggests that interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices are key elements in understanding RVFV circulation in the Madagascar highlands.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive and aggressive mosquito species that poses a significant public health threat in its expanding range. A recent study used genetic analysis to investigate the invasion history and population structure of Aedes albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region. The researchers analyzed 13 nuclear microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences to understand the historical and contemporary movements of the species.

The study found that Aedes albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or Southeast Asia. The analysis also suggested that the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded mainly from Indonesia. Notably, the study discovered a recently colonized population in the Torres Strait Islands that has undergone rapid genetic changes, which could be due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source.

The study revealed high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations, indicating that the species' genetic structure in the region is driven mainly by human movements. The research also provided a more comprehensive sampling distribution of the species' native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown. Overall, the study provides a more detailed understanding of the invasion history and population structure of Aedes albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region.
A study conducted in the Mwanza Region of North-Western Tanzania investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years. The study found that 58.7% of the children were infected with S. mansoni, with 56.5% having light infections and 16.4% having heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher infection intensities than boys. The study also found that 30.1% of the children were anemic, but there was no association between S. mansoni infection and anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. However, children with S. mansoni infection had a significantly lower score in the emotional dimension of quality of life compared to uninfected children. In contrast, infected children had a higher physical fitness level, as measured by VO2 max, compared to uninfected children. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, haemoglobin, and VO2 max were significant predictors of emotional quality of life, while physical quality of life, height, age, and haemoglobin were significant predictors of VO2 max. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection has a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness.
Researchers investigated the effects of different routes of infection on Leptospira, a bacterium that causes leptospirosis, in rats. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, and is found worldwide. The study compared three routes of infection: mucosal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal. The intraperitoneal route is commonly used in laboratory studies, but it is not a natural route of infection in rats.

The study found that all three routes of infection resulted in asymptomatic infections in rats, with similar antibody production. However, the rates of renal colonization, where the bacteria colonize the kidneys, varied depending on the route of infection. The intraperitoneal route resulted in renal colonization in all 8 rats, while the mucosal route resulted in colonization in 5 out of 8 rats, and the subcutaneous route resulted in colonization in only 1 out of 8 rats.

The study also found that the mucosal route was more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route, and resulted in a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. The results of this study can help researchers understand how Leptospira is transmitted between rats, which is important for understanding the epidemiology of the disease in wild rat populations.
Researchers have identified a new role for the protein Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in regulating the body's response to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. In a study using a mouse model of sepsis, the researchers found that mice lacking AnxA2 (anxa2-/- mice) had increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance, leading to higher mortality rates.

The study revealed that AnxA2 acts as a regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling, two key factors involved in the inflammatory response. Specifically, the researchers found that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 is crucial for regulating ROS levels, which in turn affects IL-17A levels and the overall inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout strategy reduced inflammation and improved survival in anxa2-/- mice.

The findings suggest that AnxA2 plays a critical role in mitigating the severity of sepsis by modulating ROS and IL-17A levels. The study also highlights the importance of targeting neutrophils in sepsis treatment, as AnxA2 deficiency-induced neutrophil infiltration contributes to severe organ injury and mortality. Overall, the research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis and identifies AnxA2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this life-threatening condition.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV-1 effects of Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation in macrophages. Macrophages are immune cells that play a key role in HIV-1 infection and progression to AIDS. The study found that stimulation of macrophages with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, significantly reduced HIV-1 infection. In contrast, stimulation with TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection. The study also found that the suppression of infection did not correlate with changes in CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed increased miR-155 levels in macrophages stimulated with TLR3/4, but not TLR7. A miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated macrophages. Ectopic miR-155 expression significantly reduced HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages and cell lines. The study suggests that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have identified a specific gene expression program in plants that controls growth rates in response to daily light and dark cycles. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant species, growth rates of the embryonic stem (hypocotyl) vary throughout the day, peaking at different times depending on the external photoperiod and internal circadian clock. The study used DNA microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seedlings under various growth conditions and mutant backgrounds. The results show that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are co-expressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. These genes contain a specific cis-acting element (CACATG) in their promoters, which is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. The study also found that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. The researchers propose that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between light signaling, the circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways in plants.
Researchers have explored a novel approach to controlling Chagas disease vectors, such as the triatomine insect Rhodnius prolixus, by genetically modifying its gut microbiota to deliver molecules that induce RNA interference (RNAi). This method involves feeding the insects Escherichia coli bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets specific genes involved in the insect's development, fecundity, and vectorial competence. Two genes, Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT), were targeted in this study. RHBP is an egg protein essential for insect development, while CAT is an antioxidant enzyme expressed in all tissues. The researchers found that feeding E. coli expressing RHBP and CAT dsRNA to nymphs and adult triatomines resulted in significant gene knockdown, with RHBP expression reduced by 99% in the fat body and CAT expression reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and posterior midgut, respectively. This led to increased mortality rates, reduced molting rates, and decreased oviposition. The study also showed that the natural symbiont, Rhodococcus rhodnii, can be engineered to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA, reducing RHBP expression by 89% and oviposition. These findings suggest that modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may provide a sustainable strategy for controlling Chagas disease vectors. The researchers propose using E. coli as a high-throughput system to screen for targets to be further tested with the symbiont, R. rhodnii.
A study conducted on the Thai-Burmese border from 2004 to 2006 aimed to identify the causes of fever in pregnant women. Fever in pregnancy is a significant concern as it increases the risk of maternal death and infant morbidity and mortality. The study found that febrile episodes occurred in approximately 5% of pregnant women during the 29-month study period. Malaria was the leading cause of fever, accounting for 55.5% of febrile cases. However, arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue, as well as zoonotic diseases like leptospirosis, were responsible for nearly half of all febrile illnesses. Coinfections were observed in 3.9% of women, mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever, affecting 19.7% of women. After excluding malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory illness, one-third of remaining febrile infections were caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. The study suggests that febrile pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border who do not have malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, which is effective against typhus and leptospirosis. The findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the causes of febrile illness in pregnant women in rural tropical areas to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination rates in humans by analyzing data from 69 French-Canadian pedigrees. They genotyped over 600,000 markers to identify recombination events in 195 maternal meioses. The study found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, which was localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. This effect was observed on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and on two chromosomes in the Hutterite population. The researchers propose that the decrease in recombination rates with age may contribute to the higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. Aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a major cause of miscarriage, stillbirth, and birth defects. The study's findings suggest that different chromosomes are subject to distinct selective, mechanistic, or structural constraints that influence recombination patterns over successive generations. The researchers also found that the reduction in recombination rates with age is more pronounced in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans, which may help explain the higher rates of aneuploidy in older women.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to induce innate memory in macrophages, a type of immune cell, to provide long-term protection against opportunistic infections. Unlike traditional vaccine strategies that rely on the adaptive immune system, this method uses interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) to prime macrophages in vivo, allowing them to remember and respond to specific pathogens for at least 70 days. This approach was tested using Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that can cause life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems.

The study found that macrophages primed with IFN-γ and C. neoformans were able to mount a rapid and effective response to secondary challenges, providing complete protection against the fungus in the absence of adaptive immune cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the IFN-γ primed macrophages had enhanced cytokine recall responses, which were dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased binding of the STAT1 protein to promoter regions of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity.

These findings suggest that IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo can induce a pathogen-specific innate memory-like response, providing a novel and effective mechanism for inducing vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients. This approach may be particularly useful for individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, who are unable to mount a protective immune response against certain pathogens.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and development in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, the depletion of different PRC components leads to various developmental defects, but the underlying mechanisms determining target specificity and functional diversity are not well understood. Researchers have investigated the role of PRCs in Arabidopsis seedlings by comparing changes in H3K27 tri-methylation and gene expression profiles in mutants lacking key PRC components.

The study found that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 to suppress distinct plant developmental programs. Specifically, CLF represses flower development genes in seedlings by associating with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1), while PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 repress embryo development genes in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN). This context-dependent role of CLF corresponds with changes in H3K27me3 profiles and is associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors, including MADS box and ABA-related factors.

The results suggest that different combinations of PRC members regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific transcription factors. This study provides new insights into the functional specificity of PRCs in plants and highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between PRCs and transcription factors in regulating gene expression and development.
Researchers have studied the "trigger loop" (TL) of RNA polymerase II, a crucial component of the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA. The TL plays a key role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation during the transcription process. To gain a deeper understanding of the TL's function, the researchers created nearly all possible single variants of the TL in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed their effects on the cell's ability to transcribe DNA.

The study revealed three distinct classes of mutant TL variants, each with different effects on transcription. Some mutations disrupted a hydrophobic pocket within the TL, leading to increased catalytic activity and altered translocation dynamics. Other mutations affected the TL's interactions with nearby domains, such as the funnel and bridge helices, which are critical for the TL's function.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and structural data to understand the TL's dynamics and its role in transcription. They found that the TL's ability to fold into multiple conformations is essential for its function, and that perturbations in the TL can lead to either increased or decreased catalytic activity and altered translocation dynamics. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcription and the evolution of the TL sequence and function. The approach used in this study can be applied to other essential yeast proteins to gain a deeper understanding of their functions and mechanisms.
Researchers investigated how the rabies virus (RV) invades the central nervous system (CNS) in mice. They infected mice with two different strains of RV, one associated with dogs (DOG4) and one associated with silver-haired bats (SB), either through a bite-like injection (intramuscularly, i.m.) or directly into the bloodstream (intravenously, i.v.). The study aimed to determine if the virus can spread to the brain through the bloodstream, a process known as hematogenous spread.

The results showed that while both strains caused a lethal encephalopathy when injected i.m., only the SB strain caused a lethal infection when injected i.v. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the SB strain directly infected the forebrain, specifically the hypothalamic nuclei, which are connected to the neurohypophysis and median eminence. This suggests that hematogenous spread of the SB strain can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system.

The study's findings have implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly for individuals exposed to silver-haired bat-associated RV. The results suggest that hematogenous spread of the virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of rabies, and further research is needed to understand this alternative mode of virus spread.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus, which has caused significant illness and death in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences of the virus from 1918 to 2006 and found that segmental reassortment played a key role in the virus's genomic evolution. Reassortment is a process where genetic material from different influenza viruses combines to create a new virus.

The researchers discovered that an H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired new genes through reassortment, which may have contributed to the sudden change in the virus's antigenic properties. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may have been caused by reassortant H1N1 viruses. These findings suggest that reassortment is a more significant factor in the evolution and spread of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously thought.

Influenza A viruses of the H1N1 subtype have had a substantial impact on human health, with notable epidemics occurring in the 1940s and 1950s. The researchers' analysis provides new insights into the evolutionary history of the virus and may help explain the severity of these epidemics. The study highlights the importance of reassortment in the evolution of influenza viruses and its potential role in the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential.
A computational model of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function has shed light on the mechanisms by which nicotine exerts its reinforcing action. The VTA is a key dopaminergic structure involved in signaling reward and motivation, and nicotine stimulates nAChRs in the VTA, boosting dopamine output to its targets. The study aimed to determine the dominant pathway of action for nicotine in the VTA: direct stimulation of dopamine (DA) cells through nAChR activation or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons.

The model illustrates that α4β2-containing nAChRs on either DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. The study found that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input is crucial in determining the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. For direct stimulation, low endogenous cholinergic input is necessary, while high cholinergic inputs are required for disinhibition. These results emerge from known activation and desensitization properties of α4β2 nAChRs.

The study reconciles in vitro and in vivo data, showing that the VTA model captures nicotine-evoked modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons. The results suggest that the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement. Key experiments are proposed to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms.
Researchers conducted a clinical trial in Kabul, Afghanistan to develop a new treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a chronic skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The study aimed to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of CL. A total of 113 patients with CL were randomly assigned to two groups: one received high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with a hydrogel containing sodium chlorite (DAC N-055), while the other group received EC and MWT without DAC N-055. The primary outcome was the time needed for complete wound closure. Biopsies were taken before treatment, after wound closure, and six months later to assess parasitological and histopathological changes.

The results showed that the mean duration for complete wound closure was similar in both groups, with a mean of 43.1 days in the group with DAC N-055 and 42 days in the group without it. However, in patients with Leishmania-positive biopsies after wound closure, the addition of DAC N-055 resulted in faster wound epithelialization. Superinfections occurred at the same rate in both groups, but reulcerations were more common in patients with persistent high parasite loads after healing. In vitro studies showed that DAC N-055 had a leishmanicidal effect on the parasites. Compared to previous results using intralesional antimony injections, the EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure. The study suggests that the combination of EC and MWT with or without DAC N-055 is a promising approach for treating CL.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen revealed 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors associated with the RAS/MAPK pathway. Epistasis experiments determined the position of individual candidates relative to core pathway components, revealing new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, including a new protein complex modulating RAF activation. However, most hits were found to work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consisted of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. Further characterization of two representative members of this group revealed that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. The findings indicate that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing. The study highlights the complexity of the RAS/MAPK pathway and the importance of splicing in regulating its output.
Researchers in Thailand conducted a study on 498 isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex to gain a better understanding of cryptococcosis in the country. The majority of the isolates (68.9%) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of C. neoformans and 37.5% of C. gattii strains were from HIV patients. The study found that the majority of the isolates (94.8%) were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source. Other molecular types, such as VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII, were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis identified a total of 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with some STs being unique to the country. The study revealed a greater genetic diversity among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported, with 13 different STs found among VNI strains. The majority of C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype. This suggests that Thailand may be a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The study also found that C. neoformans was the most common species identified among HIV-positive patients, while C. gattii was mainly a primary pathogen in immunocompetent patients.
Researchers analyzed the evolution of a specific type of transcription factor (TF) called Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) across 12 Drosophila species over 45 million years. They found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. These variations were found in approximately 44% of domains shared between Drosophila melanogaster and other fly species. The researchers also discovered that these diverging DNA-contacting residues are conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues, indicating functional constraint. Furthermore, these variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of Drosophila melanogaster flies, suggesting their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. The study suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans. The researchers also found that proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments. This study challenges the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provides evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
Researchers have developed a new method to quickly and accurately identify two types of bacteria that cause typhoid and paratyphoid fevers: Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. The method uses a technique called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) to target specific DNA sequences in the bacteria. This allows for the development of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays that can detect and differentiate between the two serotypes.

The new assays were tested on a large collection of strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, as well as on strains of other bacteria that can cause similar symptoms. The results showed that the assays were 100% sensitive and specific, meaning they correctly identified all strains of Typhi and Paratyphi A and did not produce false positives.

The researchers used two types of PCR assays: conventional multiplex PCR and real-time singleplex PCR. The conventional multiplex PCR assay can detect and differentiate between the two serotypes from cultured isolates, while the real-time singleplex PCR assay uses a fluorescent dye to detect the presence of the bacteria. The assays were validated on 188 strains of Typhi and 74 strains of Paratyphi A, as well as on 70 strains of other bacteria that can cause bloodstream infections.

The new CRISPR-based PCR assays are expected to facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of Typhi and Paratyphi A in clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. The assays can be used with DNA from cultured isolates, and with modifications, they can also be used with clinical and other samples.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch receptors in the immune response to Leishmania major, a protozoan parasite. They found that Notch1 and Notch2 signaling is necessary for the differentiation of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which produce the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ) to fight infection. Mice with a specific deletion of both Notch1 and Notch2 in their T cells (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were unable to control the parasite and developed unhealing lesions. In contrast, mice with a single deletion of either Notch1 or Notch2 (N1ΔCD4Cre or N2ΔCD4Cre) were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response. This suggests that Notch1 and Notch2 are redundant in driving Th1 differentiation. The researchers also found that Notch signaling is required for the secretion of IFNγ by Th1 cells, but this effect is independent of the major effector of Notch receptors, CSL/RBP-Jκ. Mice with a deletion of RBP-Jκ in their T cells were still able to develop IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells and control the parasite. The study highlights the importance of Notch signaling in the development of a functional Th1 immune response against Leishmania major infection. The findings have implications for the development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic targets against Leishmania and other infections requiring a protective IFNγ-secreting CD4+ Th1 immune response.
A study in rhesus macaques found that pre-existing infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni significantly increases susceptibility to systemic infection with the simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C) after mucosal exposure. The researchers exposed two groups of animals to decreasing doses of SHIV-C: one group consisted of normal monkeys, while the other group was infected with S. mansoni. The results showed that systemic infection occurred in the parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in the normal hosts. In fact, the dose required to infect 50% of the animals (AID50) was 17-fold lower in the parasitized animals compared to the controls. Additionally, the parasitized animals had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads and increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells. These findings provide the first direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition. The study suggests that controlling helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1, particularly in areas where both parasites and HIV-1 are endemic. The results have significant public health implications, as sub-Saharan Africa, where both parasites and HIV-1 are prevalent, accounts for more than 62% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases.
Researchers have developed a biophysical model to study the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in regulating neural excitability and sleep patterns. The model, composed of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with a M-current regulated by ACh, demonstrates three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous activity. These regimes are influenced by changes in neural excitability and network structure, and are consistent with experimental observations of cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), REM sleep, and waking states. During SWS, traveling patterns of activity occur in the cortex, whereas stationary patterns are observed in other states.

The model shows that the level of ACh determines the sensitivity of network activity to synaptic heterogeneity and can account for the reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and the shift in the phase response curve (PRC) induced by ACh. When SFA is minimal, patterns of activity are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. However, when SFA is present, traveling waves of activity naturally arise. A further decrease in ACh leads to a high degree of synchrony within traveling waves.

The model's results suggest that ACh plays a crucial role in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from these patterns. The findings may have implications for our understanding of the role of ACh in regulating sleep and arousal states, and could provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and synaptic plasticity.
Researchers investigated the role of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). They analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affecting the TLR pathway were present in 14.6% of tumors. These mutations were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease, suggesting a possible clinical significance. The study also found that TLR pathway mutations were rare in adjacent Barrett's esophagus samples, which is a precursor to EAC.

The researchers validated their findings in an external EAC dataset and in other solid tumor types exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endometrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. TLR4 was the most frequently mutated gene, with 11 mutations found in 5.8% of EAC tumors. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that certain TLR4 mutants had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, leading to reduced signaling.

The study suggests that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC and that TLR4 mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients. This is consistent with epidemiologic evidence linking the rising incidence of EAC with the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and altered esophageal microbiota in Barrett's esophagus and EAC.
Researchers investigated the development of taste cells in mice using a combination of in silico and in vivo analyses. They focused on taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRCSMs), which are essential for detecting sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. The study aimed to understand how these molecules are regulated during taste cell development.

The researchers found that TRCSMs are colocalized in developing circumvallate papillae, a type of taste bud. They used computational analysis to identify potential regulatory factors that control TRCSM expression. This analysis suggested that Hes1, a transcription factor, may play a key role in regulating TRCSM expression.

To confirm this finding, the researchers examined the expression of Hes1 in developing taste buds. They found that Hes1 is expressed in type II taste cells, which are responsible for detecting sweet and umami tastes. In mice lacking Hes1 (Hes1−/− mutants), the number of TRCSM-immunoreactive cells in the circumvallate papillae was significantly higher than in wild-type mice.

These results suggest that Hes1 is involved in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of taste cell development and highlights the importance of Hes1 in regulating TRCSM expression. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Hes1 in taste cell development and function.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth in rice, a crucial crop worldwide. Unlike the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis, the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice is not well understood. The study found that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Using a YUC activity inhibitor, the researchers showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. They identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus, resulting in reduced auxin biosynthesis and enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. The study demonstrated that YUC8/REIN7 catalyzes the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and is essential for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Furthermore, the researchers found that ethylene induces YUC8/REIN7 expression and promotes auxin accumulation in roots. The addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1 mutant, indicating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functions downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7. This study provides new insights into the interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating rice root growth and enhances our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
A nationwide study in Saudi Arabia has shed light on the growing concern of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. The study, the first of its kind in the country, collected and analyzed 527 NTM isolates from patients over a 24-month period. The results revealed a diverse range of NTM species, with 34 species identified, including 17 rare species. The most common species were Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium abscessus, which accounted for 22.6%, 18.1%, and 17.8% of the isolates, respectively. Notably, 27 new cases of Mycobacterium riyadhense, a rare and clinically relevant species, were identified.

The study also found that diabetes mellitus and a previous history of tuberculosis were independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. Rare clinical events, such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis, and ascites, were caused by various NTM species, including Mycobacterium wolinskyi, Mycobacterium holsaticum, Mycobacterium duvalii, and Mycobacterium monacence.

The study highlights the emerging challenge of NTM diseases in Saudi Arabia, with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens, elderly patients, and males affected. The findings emphasize the need for a detailed management plan for mycobacterial disease control and the development of diagnostic infrastructures to address the growing concern of NTM diseases in the country.
Researchers have discovered that the lifespan of yeast cells in a state of starvation is dependent on the accumulation of storage carbohydrates, such as trehalose and glycogen, mediated by the kinases Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15. When yeast cells are starved of glucose or other essential nutrients, they enter a state of quiescence, characterized by a halt in cell division and the acquisition of stress resistance. The study used a yeast deletion library to screen for genes involved in this process and found that the kinases Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15, as well as the SNF1/AMPK complex and cell wall integrity pathway, are necessary for proper quiescence establishment and lifespan extension.

The researchers found that the accumulation of storage carbohydrates correlates well with the extension of chronological lifespan, but not with the exit from the cell cycle. Deletion of genes involved in trehalose and glycogen biosynthesis, such as GSY2 and TPS1, severely reduces lifespan, while overexpression of these genes or supplementation with trehalose rescues the defects in quiescence exit. The study also found that the kinases Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 cooperatively control the levels of reactive oxygen species and mediate the TOR1-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and lifespan extension.

Overall, the study suggests that the primary objective of the signaling pathways activated by glucose starvation is to reprogram carbon metabolism to accumulate energy stores, which is essential for quiescence exit and lifespan extension in yeast.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the influenza A virus (IAV) adapts to the human immune system. The study found that the virus's hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect cells, undergoes a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation involves the addition of sugar molecules to the HA protein, which can help the virus evade the immune system by blocking the binding of neutralizing antibodies.

However, the researchers also found that glycosylation can have an unexpected benefit for the virus. When the virus mutates to evade the immune system, it often incurs a fitness cost, making it less able to infect cells. The study found that glycosylation can compensate for this fitness cost, allowing the virus to maintain its ability to infect cells even after it has mutated to evade the immune system.

This discovery sheds new light on the mechanisms by which IAV adapts to the human immune system and highlights the importance of glycosylation in this process. The study also demonstrates the power of high-definition virus population sequencing in revealing novel mechanisms of viral adaptation. The findings have implications for the development of more effective vaccines and therapeutics against IAV, as they suggest that glycosylation may play a critical role in the virus's ability to evade the immune system.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models to identify potential targets for antiarrhythmic drugs that exhibit favorable rate dependence. The study aimed to overcome the problem of reverse rate dependence, a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP) more at slow heart rates, leading to reduced arrhythmia suppression at fast rates and increased arrhythmia risk at slow rates. By simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing population results statistically, the researchers predicted the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple model parameters. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on AP duration were assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates.

The analysis identified various forward rate-dependent (FRD) ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. For instance, an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. The study also found that inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump are the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. A statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential. This can explain differences between species and between ventricular cell types. The study provides new insights into the determinants of AP duration rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for designing potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the relationship between genetic variations and various health conditions, known as Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS). In this study, the researchers applied PheWAS to investigate the relationship between thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity and thiopurine therapy in patients. TPMT is an enzyme that metabolizes thiopurine drugs, which are used to treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The researchers used data from a French academic hospital's clinical data warehouse to analyze the relationship between TPMT activity and various health conditions, including ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results.

The researchers developed two methods to analyze the ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. They also used discretization algorithms to analyze 11 biological test results. The study included 442 patient records, representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results showed that iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with high TPMT activity. The study highlights the potential of PheWAS to identify new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management.

This study is the first to use ICD-10 classification in PheWAS, and it demonstrates the potential of PheWAS to identify new associations between genetic variations and health conditions. The study's findings suggest that high TPMT activity may be associated with a failure of thiopurine therapy and sustained steroid requirements in IBD patients. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential of PheWAS in pharmacogenomics.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies on stem cell transplantation in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) suggests that allogeneic stem cell treatment may improve both motor and sensory outcomes in animal models of SCI. The analysis, which included 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations, found that allogeneic stem cell treatment resulted in a 27.2% improvement in motor function and a 26.3% improvement in sensory function compared to control groups. The study also identified several factors that influenced the effectiveness of stem cell treatment, including the type of stem cell used, the route of delivery, and the presence of immunosuppression. Differentiation of stem cells before implantation and intravenous delivery were found to favor better outcomes, while stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcomes in female animals and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. The study also found that the location of injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression all had an impact on motor outcomes. However, the study's authors note that the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias may mean that the efficacy of stem cell treatment is likely to be lower than reported. The study's findings suggest that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise for the treatment of SCI, but further research is needed to confirm these results and determine their clinical relevance.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the primary control strategy. However, this approach does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. The study included 51 studies and found that at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides reinfection reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, the respective reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67%, and 82%, and for hookworm, 30%, 55%, and 57%. The study also found that the prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. The results suggest that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Therefore, frequent anthelmintic drug administrations may be necessary to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. The study highlights the need for integrated control approaches that emphasize health education and environmental sanitation to interrupt transmission of STH.
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) to investigate the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a spectrum of diseases characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Traditional pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) methods rely on predefined pathway maps, which can be biased by different annotations and cannot capture the complex interactions within genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs).

MiNEA generates all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs) that can synthesize a target metabolite, allowing for the identification of deregulated MiNs and key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes. The method was applied to human and mouse liver samples with condition-specific transcriptomics data, revealing key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both species. The study also found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice.

MiNEA is a flexible method that can be applied to any GEM and target metabolite, making it a valuable tool for studying condition-specific metabolism in various diseases or organisms. The method can identify deregulated metabolic processes, such as lipid droplet formation, lipoapoptosis, liver inflammation, and oxidative stress, by formulating metabolic tasks (MTs) that mimic these phenotypes. MiNEA overcomes the limitations of traditional PEA methods by capturing the complex interactions within GEMs and providing a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic deregulation in NAFLD.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of primacy coding, a method where the identity of an odor is encoded by the types of olfactory receptors that respond earliest. They analyzed a simple model of neural representations of olfactory stimuli and found that primacy coding provides a compact and informative representation that can be interpreted efficiently by the brain. The encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. This representation is independent of the odor intensity, making it useful for identifying odors in the olfactory cortex.

Numerical simulations and statistical descriptions showed that primacy coding outperforms other simple coding schemes, such as binary and normalized coding. The model predicts that receptors are only useful if their likelihood to respond to incoming odors is similar. Experiments suggest that odors are encoded robustly by the receptor types that respond within a given time window after sniff onset, supporting the idea of primacy coding.

The researchers found that a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors in certain situations. The model also suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, allowing for predictions on how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. Overall, primacy coding provides an efficient odor representation that is independent of odor intensity and might help identify odors in the olfactory cortex.
A recent study investigated the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) against a wide range of viruses. The researchers found that all bnMAbs tested showed incomplete neutralization, meaning they did not reach 100% neutralization, and many had non-sigmoidal slopes in their neutralization curves. This phenomenon was observed in both pseudovirus and molecular clone panels, as well as in viruses produced in both cell lines and primary cells. The study found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of the Env and gp41 were more likely to show incomplete neutralization, while those targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to do so. The CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies also showed incomplete neutralization, but at a lower frequency. The study's findings have implications for the use of bnMAbs in therapy and as tools for vaccine design. The researchers suggest that incomplete neutralization may be due to glycan heterogeneity, but other mechanisms, such as conformational heterogeneity of the Env trimer, may also play a role. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between incomplete neutralization in pseudovirus assays and anti-viral activity of bnMAbs in vivo. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of HIV neutralization and the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying incomplete neutralization by bnMAbs.
Researchers used a computational model to study how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine for energy and growth. They found that when cancer cells use high amounts of glutamine, they produce more lactate from both glucose and glutamine, even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic pattern, called the WarburQ effect, is optimal for producing biomass and ATP, the energy currency of the cell. It involves a branched tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation helps produce lipids and proteins. The researchers also found that this pattern is sustained by redox-controlled metabolic reactions. They validated their findings in a K-ras transformed cell line, which is a type of cancer cell line. The study suggests that the competition between glucose and glutamine may play a key role in cancer cell growth. The researchers used a constraint-based approach to systematically evaluate the possible wirings of the metabolic network required for biomass formation from glucose and glutamine under different nutritional conditions. They identified boundary conditions that promote the emergence of cancer metabolic rewiring, which is characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis and glutamine utilization. The study provides new insights into the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth and suggests that the WarburQ effect may be a common feature of various tumor cell lines.
Researchers have investigated the interactions of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (Prnd) and Shadoo (Sprn), in a cell culture model that supports prion replication. The study aimed to identify the molecular environment that facilitates the conversion of PrPC to its disease-associated isoform, PrPSc. By analyzing the interactome of PrPC, Prnd, and Sprn in neuroblastoma cells, the researchers found that these proteins share a similar molecular environment and interact with each other. They also identified interactions between PrPC and several other proteins, including the neural cell adhesion molecule, laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). These interactions were confirmed through validation experiments and suggest that PrPC may play a role in the accumulation of PrPSc. The study proposes a hypothesis that PrPC organizes its molecular environment by binding to adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, which in turn recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. The findings suggest that members of the prion protein family may be embedded in specialized membrane domains that support functions in adhesion control, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion events. The study provides new insights into the molecular environment that hosts the conformational conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, a key step in the development of prion diseases.
Researchers investigated the role of type 2 cytokines, specifically interleukin-5 (IL-5), in the immune response to influenza virus infection. They found that IL-5 is produced in the lungs of infected mice, particularly during the recovery phase after the virus has been cleared. This production of IL-5 is linked to the accumulation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the lungs. The researchers identified group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as the primary source of IL-5 in the infected lungs. ILC2 cells are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the production of type 2 cytokines.

The study also found that NKT cells and alveolar macrophages, another type of immune cell, produce IL-33, a protein that enhances IL-5 production by ILC2. This interaction between ILC2, NKT cells, and alveolar macrophages leads to the production of IL-5 and the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs. The researchers suggest that this process may have both protective and detrimental effects, as type 2 cytokines like IL-5 can contribute to asthma exacerbation, but may also play a role in tissue repair and protection. The study provides new insights into the complex immune response to influenza virus infection and the role of type 2 cytokines in this process.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively analyzed 102 cases of iNTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. The majority of patients (71%) were HIV-infected adults, with 71% being male and 33% reporting intravenous drug use. The most commonly identified serovars were Salmonella Enteritidis (48%) and Salmonella Typhimurium (26%), with the latter being significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals. Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The mortality rate was 28%, with HIV infection being a significant risk factor for death. The study highlights that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam, with a high mortality rate similar to that of sub-Saharan Africa. HIV infection was the major risk factor for both infection and death in this setting, with the majority of the burden in this population found in HIV-infected adult men. The study suggests that continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for the emergence or introduction of multi-drug resistant strains or strains with enhanced virulence.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify viral and phage structural proteins using artificial neural networks (ANNs). These proteins are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts, and their identification is essential for understanding the physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health. However, identifying these proteins from sequence data can be challenging due to low sequence conservation and limited experimental data.

The researchers trained ANNs to classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency and protein isoelectric points. The ANNs were able to correctly classify a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. To validate the predictions, the researchers used transmission electron microscopy to examine several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins. The results showed that some of these ORFs self-assembled into structures resembling virion structures.

The ANNs were able to identify phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. The networks will be valuable when sequence data is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible. The researchers also demonstrated the potential of ANNs to recognize classes of virion structural proteins by training neural networks with sequences from prophages, proviruses, and the genomes of viruses that infect prokarya, eukarya, and archaea.
Researchers have identified a protein called oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) as an interacting partner of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF20. ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle were not well understood. The study used a quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) approach to identify OASL as an interaction partner of ORF20. This interaction was conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses.

The researchers found that OASL and ORF20 shared numerous ribosomal interaction partners and copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. When expressed together, they associated with polysomes, but did not have a global effect on translation. OASL has been characterized as an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesvirus infections was unknown. The study showed that OASL and ORF20 mRNA expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV cells.

Intriguingly, the researchers found that OASL enhanced infection of KSHV. However, during infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. This suggests that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection. The study provides new insights into the interaction between OASL and ORF20 and their roles in KSHV infection.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. The study included 913 consecutive febrile children aged 1 month to 15 years admitted to a hospital over a year. Of these, 373 (40.9%) had fever, and 108 (29%) presented with convulsions. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%) in febrile admissions, with 3/108 (2.8%) in children with convulsions and 10/265 (3.8%) in those without convulsions. The odds ratio of LVD in children with convulsions versus those without was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.2, 2.7), indicating no significant association between LVD and convulsions. However, vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The study found that LVD is an important cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever, in children in endemic areas, but its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. The study suggests that screening febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD could be an important medical and public health control measure.
Researchers investigated the role of the karrikin receptor KAI2 in drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant species. They found that mutations in the KAI2 gene, which encodes the proposed karrikin receptor, result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. This suggests that KAI2 plays a positive role in drought resistance. The researchers performed a range of analyses, including transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical studies, to understand the basis for KAI2-regulated drought resistance. They found that kai2 mutants have increased rates of water loss and drought-induced cell membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. Additionally, kai2 plants have reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought and are hyposensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes associated with the observed physiological and biochemical changes. The study provides evidence for crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. The researchers also found that the strigolactone receptor mutant d14 contributes to plant drought adaptation, although not by affecting cuticle development. Overall, the findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 and D14 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance in plants.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth, development, and reproduction of adult Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. The study focused on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of S. japonicum, which were previously cloned and partially characterized. The researchers found that human insulin binds to the L1 subdomain of the SjIRs, suggesting that the parasite exploits host insulin for growth and development. Using RNA interference (RNAi), the researchers knocked down the expression of the SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro and observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake and reduced transcription of downstream genes involved in glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. In vaccine/challenge experiments, the researchers found that recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in mice infected with S. japonicum. These findings suggest that the SjIRs are potential targets for a vaccine against schistosomiasis japonica. The study provides further evidence that the insulin pathway plays a crucial role in the growth and development of S. japonicum, and that targeting this pathway may be an effective strategy for controlling the parasite. The results also highlight the potential of the SjIRs as vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to combat lymphatic filariasis (LF), a leading cause of disability in the South Pacific, where over 1.7 million people are at risk of infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) efforts have reduced LF prevalence, but the mosquito vector, Aedes polynesiensis, complicates the MDA strategy. In some regions, MDA alone may not be enough to eliminate LF. The researchers created a new strain of Aedes polynesiensis, called the 'CP' strain, by introducing Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi into the mosquito. This strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory tests showed that CP males are equally competitive and can outcompete wild-type males, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild-type Aedes polynesiensis populations. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of this vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts. This approach targets the primary vector, Aedes polynesiensis, which is responsible for LF transmission in the South Pacific. The strategy involves releasing bi-directionally incompatible males, which induce sterility in females, ultimately leading to population elimination. This method has the potential to be used in other regions and against other vector species, such as Culex spp. or other aedine LF vectors in the South Pacific.
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a fatal disease if left untreated. In Tanzania, HAT is a significant public health concern, particularly in the Urambo District, where it is highly endemic. A recent study aimed to quantify the burden of rhodesiense HAT in this region by analyzing hospital records from 143 patients treated for the disease in 2004. The study estimated the disease's impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and financial costs.

The results showed that the burden of HAT in Urambo District is substantial, with estimated DALYs ranging from 215.7 to 978.9, depending on the level of under-reporting. The study also found that patients and their families incur significant costs, with patients paying $3,673 and the health services paying $11,841 for treatment. Indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients were estimated at $9,781.

The study highlights the need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates, particularly in rural areas where infectious diseases like HAT are often concentrated. The findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the socio-economic and public health impacts of HAT in affected communities. The study's results are consistent with previous studies on other neglected diseases in Tanzania, which have shown high burdens on local health systems and communities. The study's findings also suggest that the HIV/AIDS pandemic may have contributed to an increase in the burden of HAT in Tanzania.
Researchers investigated the role of the Ngly1 gene in mice, which codes for a de-N-glycosylating enzyme. Mice lacking the Ngly1 gene (Ngly1-deficient mice) were found to be embryonic lethal in a specific genetic background. However, when the Engase gene, another de-N-glycosylating enzyme, was also deleted, the lethality of the Ngly1-deficient mice was partially rescued. This suggests that Ngly1's function is related to its ability to deglycosylate proteins. Additionally, changing the genetic background of the Ngly1-deficient mice by crossing them with an outbred mouse strain (ICR) also partially rescued the embryonic lethality. Mice lacking both Ngly1 and Engase (Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice) showed a severe phenotype, similar to symptoms observed in humans with NGLY1-deficiency. The deletion of Engase in these mice suppressed many of the observed defects. The study's findings suggest that Ngly1-deficient mice could serve as a valuable model for studying the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency, and that Engase may be a potential therapeutic target for this genetic disorder. The research also identified specific N-glycoproteins that accumulate in Ngly1/Engase-deficient cells, which may be linked to the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency. Overall, the study provides new insights into the biological function of Ngly1 and Engase in mice and has implications for understanding and treating NGLY1-deficiency in humans.
Researchers studied how gene expression noise affects spatial patterning in Drosophila (fruit fly) segmentation. They focused on the hunchback (hb) gene, which is activated by the Bicoid (Bcd) protein gradient. Gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, which can produce variable expression. The study aimed to identify how noise is controlled during gene expression by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on hb promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics.

The researchers used a stochastic model of the hb promoter, varying the number and strength of Bcd and Hb binding sites. They fit the model to data from wild-type embryos, a self-regulation mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs with different portions of the hb promoter. The results indicate that wild-type Hb output noise is primarily dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, rather than Bcd fluctuations. The study also found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise.

The model was robust to variations in Bcd binding site number across different fly species. The study identified specific ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise, including the importance of multiple regulatory sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback. These findings contribute to the understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development. The study suggests that similar noise-reducing mechanisms may be applicable to other genes involved in spatial patterning.
Researchers have studied the genetic legacy of Neanderthals in modern humans, finding that selection has removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. To understand the strength and causes of this selection, scientists developed a new method to estimate the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using Neanderthal allele frequencies in modern humans. The study found that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The majority of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is attributed to many weakly deleterious alleles that were effectively neutral in Neanderthals but became selected against after entering human populations of larger effective size. These alleles, individually of small effect, imposed a significant genetic load on early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. The study suggests that differences in effective population size may play a more significant role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. The research provides new insights into how selection shaped the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to modern human genomes and sheds light on the nature of human-Neanderthal hybridization. The findings have implications for understanding how populations remain distinct after secondary contact and highlight the importance of nearly neutral dynamics and effective population size in determining levels of introgression across species and along the genome.
Researchers studied how the HIV virus controls its own gene expression after it integrates into a host cell's genome. They found that the virus's promoter, a region of DNA that regulates gene expression, can switch between an active and inactive state. This switching is influenced by the recruitment of host cell factors, such as Sp1 and NF-κB, which can either activate or repress viral gene expression. The study used a model virus with mutations in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements to understand how these factors contribute to the regulation of viral gene expression. The results showed that the Sp1 sites stabilize both the active and inactive states of the virus, while the NF-κB sites have distinct properties, with one site playing a stronger activating role than the other. The study also found that mutations in the Sp1 sites lead to a higher frequency of clonal bifurcation, or the formation of distinct cell populations with different levels of viral gene expression. This suggests that the Sp1 sites play a crucial role in modulating the frequency and maintenance of viral latency, or the dormant state of the virus. The findings have implications for the treatment of HIV latency, which is a major obstacle to curing the disease. By understanding how the virus controls its own gene expression, researchers may be able to develop new strategies to target and eliminate latent HIV infections.
Researchers compared the accuracy of nine leading orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA, as well as two standard methods, bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of these methods in identifying orthologs, which are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene. The researchers used six different tests to compare the predictions of these methods with respect to both phylogenetic and functional definitions of orthology.

The results showed that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis with high specificity. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage, OrthoMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent, Inparanoid. EggNOG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories, but was not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. The study also found that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperformed projects with more complex algorithms.

This study provides guidance for users of orthology data on which database best suits their needs. It also introduces new methodology for verifying orthology and sets performance standards for current and future approaches. The findings have implications for various applications, including protein annotation and phylogenetic analysis, where accurate ortholog prediction is crucial.
Researchers have developed a new approach to find effective treatments for schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, has been in use for 40 years and is showing signs of resistance. To combat this, the researchers used a computational method called drug repurposing to identify new potential treatments. They focused on protein kinases, which play a crucial role in the parasite's biology, and analyzed the kinomes of the three main species of Schistosoma that infect humans. By comparing the kinomes to the human kinome, they identified potential targets and existing inhibitors that could be effective against the parasites. This led to the discovery of 22 new potential targets and several approved drugs that could be repurposed as schistosomicidal agents. These include bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, and dinaciclib. The researchers also identified the primary and secondary targets in Schistosoma of these approved drugs, paving the way for the development of new therapeutics against schistosomiasis. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the kinomes of all three infective Schistosoma species and highlights the potential of kinase inhibitors as a new class of schistosomicidal agents.
Researchers studied how the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB folds and binds to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. The pKID domain is known to be unstructured when not bound to a target, suggesting that folding and binding occur together. Simulations of a Gō-type model predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism, with partially bound intermediates forming during the process. Analysis of transition-path and Φ-value data revealed that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, indicating that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This finding is consistent with an induced-fit mechanism, where the ligand (pKID) changes conformation upon binding, rather than binding to a pre-structured conformation. Increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduced the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting" process. The inclusion of attractive non-native interactions resulted in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhanced the on-rate of binding, but did not change the binding mechanism. The study's findings are in agreement with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study and provide insight into how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition.
A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection among children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and territories was conducted to assess the progress towards a regional elimination goal. The review included 132 articles published between 1942 and 2014, providing 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. The majority of the data came from Brazil, where several "hot spots" with high prevalence were identified. The review found that Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their national programs to target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys are needed to verify this status. The review also highlighted the need for improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies used in schistosomiasis programs. Meeting the regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex. Schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem, with over 200 million people infected and 700 million at risk globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines for verification of elimination, which include reaching a prevalence of severe intensity of infection of less than 5% and 1%, respectively.
Researchers studied how HIV-1 subtype C is transmitted from one person to another through heterosexual contact. They analyzed 167 near full-length viral genomes and created 40 infectious molecular clones from six linked transmission pairs. These clones included the transmitted/founder (TF) virus and multiple non-transmitted (NT) viruses from the same pairs. The study found that consensus-like genomes, which are sensitive to donor antibodies, were selected for during transmission. However, the TF viruses did not have increased viral fitness or resistance to interferon-α (IFN-α) compared to the NT viruses from the same pairs. This suggests that in vitro viral replicative capacity and IFN-α resistance do not determine the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of chronically infected individuals. The study's findings support the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. The researchers also found that HIV-1 transmission was not mediated by TF viruses with higher levels of IFN-α resistance than NT viruses, indicating that factors other than IFN-α resistance are the dominant determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of HIV-1 transmission and may lead to new targets for intervention.
Filarial parasites, which cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis, have been found to directly influence the lymphatic system in the body. Research has shown that even in the absence of an adaptive immune system, lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction occur in mouse models infected with filarial parasites. However, severe and irreversible lymphedema and elephantiasis appear to require an intact adaptive immune response in human infections.

In a recent study, human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or serum from infected patients. The results showed that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant proliferation and differentiation of LEC into tube-like structures in vitro. Furthermore, serum from patients with patent filarial infections and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction induced increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals.

The study also found that the differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their tissue inhibitors. Gene expression analysis revealed that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, leading to decreased trans-endothelial transport.

These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis. The study's results have implications for understanding the direct influence of filarial parasites on the lymphatic system and may lead to the development of new treatments for lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers have developed a new method to amplify and sequence the genomes of single bacterial cells using a technique called Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA). This approach eliminates the need to culture the bacteria in a laboratory, allowing scientists to study microorganisms that are difficult or impossible to grow in a controlled environment. A microfluidic device was used to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA in extremely small reaction volumes of 60 nanoliters. The results showed that reducing the reaction volume from microliters to nanoliters significantly improved the quality of the genome amplification, reducing nonspecific synthesis and amplification bias. The amplified DNA was then sequenced using high-throughput pyrosequencing, producing high-quality sequence data. This new method provides a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells, which is essential for studying microbial ecology and evolution. The majority of microorganisms cannot be obtained in pure culture, making this method a valuable tool for scientists. The results also suggest that the combination of MDA and emulsion PCR sample preparation may be a powerful approach to single-cell sequencing applications. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of nanoliter reactors to improve the accuracy and efficiency of genome amplification from single cells.
Researchers studied the relationship between hantavirus hosts and human disease in the Atlantic Forest, a tropical region in South America. They found that the proportion of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities is influenced by landscape diversity, with more diverse landscapes having a higher proportion of hantavirus hosts. This is likely due to the increased availability of agricultural areas and other native habitats, such as the Cerrado. The researchers also discovered that local small mammal diversity has a positive effect on the proportion of hantavirus hosts in most of the Atlantic Forest, but this effect is diluted in southern communities.

The study tested four hypotheses to explain the variation in hantavirus host proportions, including the influence of agricultural matrix, landscape diversity, defaunation intensity, and local small mammal diversity. The results showed that landscape diversity and local small mammal diversity have a positive effect on the proportion of hantavirus hosts, while defaunation intensity has a geographically varying influence. The study also found that the presence of sugarcane and tree plantations increases the proportion of rodent hosts, but defaunation intensity does not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes.

The researchers assessed the correspondence between the proportion of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities and human vulnerability to hantavirus infection across the entire Atlantic Forest biome. They found a spatial match between host hotspots and human disease vulnerability in 17% of the region, while coldspots matched 20%. The study suggests that disease surveillance should be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome, where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match.
Researchers have identified a key protein, BCLXL, that plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. Flaviviruses are a family of viruses that can cause severe diseases in humans and animals. The study found that BCLXL helps infected cells survive by suppressing the expression of another protein, MCL1, which is involved in cell death. When BCLXL is inhibited or deficient, cells infected with flaviviruses undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, due to the activation of BAX/BAK proteins.

The researchers also discovered that flavivirus infection impairs cellular protein synthesis, leading to a reduction in short-lived proteins like MCL1. Inhibiting BCLXL increased the phagocytosis of infected cells by macrophages, which helps to suppress the spread of the virus and reduce inflammation. In animal studies, reducing BCLXL levels or administering BH3 mimetic compounds, which inhibit BCLXL, increased survival rates after infection with Japanese encephalitis virus and reduced inflammation.

These findings suggest that BCLXL is a critical factor in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel target for antiviral therapy. The study proposes a model to explain the regulation of BCL2 family proteins during flavivirus infection, highlighting the importance of BCLXL in delaying apoptosis and allowing the virus to spread to neighboring cells, leading to high pathogenicity.
A study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005 to 2014. The analysis included direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs, livestock, and humans, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and dog vaccination efforts. The study found that the total economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam over the 10-year period was over $719 million USD, with 92% of the costs attributed to PEP-related expenses. Canine rabies resulted in between 36,560 and 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), measured in years of life lost (YLL), and 914 human deaths were reported during the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD.

The study's findings indicate that the most cost-effective control of canine rabies in humans is through coordinated veterinary public health campaigns that prevent human rabies, rather than suppressing the disease through PEP administration. The results show that canine rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with those reported in other Asian countries, with large expenditures on PEP and minimal investments in dog vaccination. The study highlights the need for increased investment in dog vaccination efforts to reduce the economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam.
Researchers have identified a crucial component of the Type II Secretion System (T2SS), a molecular machine that transports proteins across the outer membrane of bacteria. The T2SS consists of a secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore, and a pilotin, a protein that mediates transport and assembly of the secretin into the outer membrane. Two distinct forms of T2SSs, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, have been identified based on the sequence characteristics of their secretins. A novel pilotin, AspS, has been discovered in Vibrio cholerae, which is structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. However, AspS is functionally equivalent to these pilotins, binding to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins and enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. The researchers found that homologs of AspS are present in all species of Vibrio, as well as in some strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS. This suggests that AspS is a key component of the Vibrio-type T2SS, and its presence is correlated with the secretion of specific substrates. The discovery of AspS provides new insights into the assembly and function of the T2SS, and highlights the convergent evolution of this protein in different bacterial species.
Researchers have identified a protein, OmpL37, on the surface of pathogenic Leptospira bacteria that plays a crucial role in the infection process of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a disease caused by Leptospira bacteria, which are shed in the urine of infected animals and can be transmitted to humans through skin abrasions or mucous membranes. The study found that OmpL37 binds to elastin, a protein found in human skin and blood vessels, with high affinity. This binding is thought to facilitate the attachment of Leptospira to host tissues, particularly during the initial stage of infection.

The researchers used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test the binding capacity of OmpL37 to various host tissue components, including elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The results showed that OmpL37 binds to elastin with a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 104±19 nM for human skin elastin and 152±27 nM for aortic elastin.

The study also found that antibodies against OmpL37 can enhance the binding of Leptospira to elastin-rich tissues, suggesting that the host immune response may actually aid the bacteria during the infection process. The researchers detected OmpL37 in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira, indicating that OmpL37 is a novel virulence factor involved in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
Researchers have studied two broadly neutralizing antibodies, 4E10 and 2F5, isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, which recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41. These antibodies are polyreactive, binding to the viral membrane and their epitopes in the MPER. A model was developed to calculate the probability that a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp41 before fusion is complete. The model predicts that for 4E10 and 2F5 to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in a stable conformation, approximately five minutes or less. The study also investigated the role of avidity in neutralization and found that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, likely due to 2F5 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. The model was used to elucidate the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and was extended to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridges between the virus and target cell at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate. The study suggests that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the exact number cannot be determined from neutralization experiments alone.
Researchers conducted a long-term study in Mali and Senegal to determine if mass treatment with ivermectin could eliminate onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease spread by blackflies, in areas where the disease is highly prevalent. The study involved 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment in three hyperendemic areas. After the final treatment, skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and analyzing 492,600 blackflies for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae. The results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two sites, the prevalence of microfilaria and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were higher before stopping treatment, there was a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. The study found that all infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination, establishing the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The study's results have informed the shift from onchocerciasis control to elimination efforts in Africa.
Researchers have investigated the role of the capsid protein VP4 in the entry of human rhinovirus, a common cause of the common cold, into host cells. Human rhinovirus is a non-enveloped virus that must deliver its genetic material across the cell membrane without fusing with it. The study found that the small, myristoylated protein VP4 is released from the virus and interacts with the cell membrane, facilitating the delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. To understand this process, the researchers produced a recombinant version of VP4 with a histidine tag and tested its ability to induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes. The results showed that VP4 forms a multimeric, size-selective pore in the membrane, allowing the transfer of single-stranded RNA. The pore's dimensions are consistent with the transport of the viral genome. The researchers also found that the membrane permeability induced by VP4 is influenced by pH and is comparable to the permeability induced by infectious virions. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and suggest that VP4 could be a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family, which includes other significant pathogens such as poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus.
Researchers have identified a mutant strain of Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, which elicits protective immunity in mice. The mutant strain lacks the ability to add galactosamine and/or mannose to its lipid A molecule, a key component of the bacterial cell wall. This modification is crucial for the bacterium's virulence and ability to evade the host's immune system. Mice infected with the mutant strain produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inhibitory protein-2, compared to those infected with the wild-type strain. Additionally, bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice infected with the mutant strain produced higher levels of interleukin-6 and macrophage inhibitory protein-2. These findings suggest that the mutant strain activates the innate immune system and induces a pro-inflammatory response, leading to its attenuation and the induction of protective immunity. The researchers hypothesize that the ability of the mutant strain to activate the MyD88 signaling pathway, a key component of the innate immune response, may be responsible for its attenuation. The study's findings suggest that carbohydrate modifications of lipid A play a crucial role in bacterial virulence and protective immunity, and may aid in the development of an effective Francisella vaccine.
Researchers have investigated the role of the GTPase Era in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a ribosome-associated GTPase that acts as a molecular switch to coordinate ribosome assembly. The study found that Era is not essential for the growth of S. aureus, but is important for the assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA, and both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. The study also found that Era and CshA interact with the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelSau, with RelSau positively impacting the GTPase activity of Era but negatively affecting the helicase activity of CshA. The researchers propose that Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome, directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing and degradation to their site of action. This activity is impeded by multiple components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype associated with this stress response pathway. The study provides new insights into the role of Era in ribosome assembly and the stringent response in S. aureus, and highlights the importance of Era and CshA in rRNA homeostasis and growth at low temperatures.
Researchers investigated the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and found that the heart is an early target of the toxin. They discovered that mice lacking the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were more sensitive to LT and experienced increased cardiac damage compared to mice with normal nNOS levels. Histopathological analyses revealed architectural changes in the hearts of nNOS-deficient mice, including novel inter-fiber spaces and endothelial/capillary necrosis. Electron microscopy showed similar pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS-deficient and wild-type mice, but with varying severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury, such as myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein, were elevated in both nNOS-deficient and wild-type mice after LT treatment. Echocardiography showed a reduction in ejection fraction in both groups, indicating decreased contractile function in the heart. The study suggests that nNOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage. The researchers also found that pharmacological inhibition of nNOS with 7-nitroindazole increased the sensitivity of wild-type mice to LT, further supporting the protective role of nNOS. Additionally, the study found that cardiac protective nitrite therapy and allopurinol therapy did not have beneficial effects, but the potent nitric oxide scavenger carboxy-PTIO showed some protective effect against LT.
Scientists have developed a new method to edit the genes of parasitic nematodes, a type of worm that infects over 1 billion people worldwide. These parasites cause some of the most common neglected tropical diseases, but their biology has been difficult to study due to the lack of tools for genetic intervention. Researchers used a technique called CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the twitchin gene, unc-22, in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. This resulted in nematodes with severe motility defects, such as decreased movement and twitching. The mutations were also heritable, meaning they were passed on to the next generation.

The researchers used a similar approach to disrupt the unc-22 gene in the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti. This demonstrates the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to parasitic nematodes, enabling future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites. The new method involves delivering CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into free-living adults of the parasite and characterizing the mutations in the next generation. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the study of parasitic nematodes and could lead to a better understanding of their biology and the development of new treatments for the diseases they cause.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop-off on protein translation in cells. Ribosome drop-off occurs when ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, prematurely terminate translation due to stress conditions such as amino acid starvation or high levels of recombinant protein expression. The model reveals that ribosome drop-off can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, where the density of ribosomes increases from the 5' to the 3' end of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Importantly, the model shows that the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rates are mRNA-specific, with some mRNAs being more resilient to drop-off than others.

The model predicts that mRNAs that can sustain a queue of ribosomes are less affected by ribosome drop-off, while those that cannot sustain a queue are more affected. Additionally, the model suggests that mRNAs with higher translation rates are more resilient to ribosome drop-off. This is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which shows that mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. In contrast, mRNAs coding for regulatory and stress-related proteins are less resilient to ribosome drop-off. The model provides a tool to analyze variations in translational efficiency of individual mRNAs and explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
Researchers are exploring alternative strategies to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, which affect millions of children worldwide. The current World Health Organization strategy involves routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children, but this approach may not be effective in the long term due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. To accelerate the interruption of transmission, mass drug administration (MDA) is being considered. However, sustaining high MDA coverage levels across entire communities is a significant challenge.

A study, DeWorm3, is currently investigating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using MDA. The trial involves three years of high treatment coverage followed by two years of surveillance to assess whether transmission interruption has occurred. Researchers are now investigating whether criteria can be defined to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely at earlier timepoints. A stochastic, individual-based simulation model was used to simulate the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial, comparing a control arm with annual treatment of children alone with MDA and an intervention arm with community-wide biannual treatment with MDA.

The analysis suggests that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. The study found that a tight range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters does not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholerae O1 (Ogawa) O-Specific Polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc). The vaccine, called OSP:TThc, was tested in mice to evaluate its ability to induce protective immunity against cholera. The study found that mice immunized with OSP:TThc developed significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP after a single immunization, and anti-LPS IgG responses after a second immunization. In contrast, mice that received un-conjugated OSP or immunoadjuvant alone did not develop anti-OSP or anti-LPS IgG responses. The study also found that administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. The results suggest that the conjugate vaccine is protectively immunogenic and could help induce long-term protective immunity, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. The study's findings support the development of a cholera conjugate vaccine, which could provide a more effective way to protect against cholera, a disease caused by Vibrio cholerae.
Researchers have discovered that the fungus Candida albicans can inhibit the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the gut. In a study using a mouse model, Candida albicans was found to suppress the expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa's pyochelin and pyoverdine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. As a result, Pseudomonas aeruginosa's ability to cause disease was significantly reduced. This effect was not seen when heat-killed Candida albicans was used, suggesting that live Candida albicans secreted proteins are responsible for the inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence.

The study also found that the suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes did not affect Pseudomonas aeruginosa's ability to colonize the gut, but did reduce its cytotoxic effects on colonocytes. Furthermore, oral iron supplementation restored Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence in mice colonized by both Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The researchers suggest that Candida albicans secreted proteins may modulate the host's oxidative stress response, leading to changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence. These findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and fungi in the gut and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for preventing microbial disease.
Researchers studied the behavior of a virus that has mutated to evade the immune system's CD8 T cells, a common occurrence in HIV and SIV infections. This "escape mutant" (EM) virus is often less fit than the original "wild-type" (WT) virus, leading to its eventual reversion to WT upon transmission to a new host. However, the rate and timing of this reversion can vary greatly. The study used a sensitive PCR assay to track the reversion of SIV and SHIV viruses containing small amounts of WT virus in pigtail macaques. The results showed that when the inoculum contained at least 10% WT virus, the WT virus rapidly outgrew the EM virus within 7 days of infection. In contrast, when the inoculum contained smaller proportions of WT virus, the reversion was delayed, taking up to 8 weeks for the WT virus to become the dominant quasispecies. This delayed reversion was associated with lower viral loads. The study found that the diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The findings suggest that in some cases, the delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations may provide opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations from Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that some strains have a high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that this resistance is primarily due to an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump called PCA1. Molecular analysis revealed that mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence are responsible for this enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments showed that three specific single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter increase its activity and enhance cadmium resistance. These nucleotides are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other yeast species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides have diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave cells a growth advantage under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. This study provides a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. The findings suggest that the spread of a weak PCA1 allele in most S. cerevisiae populations is due to a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions. This tradeoff allowed cells to maintain a certain level of cadmium efflux activity without compromising their fitness under normal conditions.
Researchers have identified three major oncogenic pathways - proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin - that are deregulated in more than 70% of gastric cancers, the second leading cause of global cancer mortality. Using gene expression signatures, the team developed an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. They found that patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions play a crucial role in influencing disease behavior.

The researchers developed an in silico method to map activation levels of different pathways in complex primary tumor profiles and validated this approach using proof-of-concept examples from breast cancer. They applied this method to gastric cancer to evaluate eleven oncogenic pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA1, and Wnt/β-catenin.

The team's strategy for predicting levels of oncogenic pathway activation in cancers involves four steps: defining pathway signatures, mapping these signatures onto gene expression profiles, validating the approach, and applying it to primary gastric cancer. They found that it is feasible to predict patterns of pathway activation in gastric cancer using expression signatures obtained from different experimental conditions and tissue types. The study suggests that individual gastric cancers can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups, allowing for the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers.
Researchers have used a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to analyze the Escherichia coli K12 genome and identify regions susceptible to strand separation under negative superhelical stress. The study found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions containing promoters, but rarely in coding regions. The researchers then investigated whether genes grouped in different functional categories have characteristic SIDD properties in their upstream flanks. They discovered that strong SIDD sites are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Specifically, the upstream regions of genes that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those of genes not involved in these responses. Furthermore, if a pathway is controlled by a transcriptional regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, the genes in that pathway often contain strongly destabilized SIDD sites in their 5' flanks. This association was observed in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria. The results suggest that strong SIDD sites 5' to participating genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, which are known to transiently alter superhelicity. The study proposes that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
Researchers have identified a network of high-mobility group (HMG) box transcription factors in the fungus Podospora anserina that play a crucial role in regulating the sexual cycle. The study found that 11 out of 12 HMG-box genes in P. anserina are involved in the sexual cycle, with some genes acting as activators and others as repressors. One HMG-box gene, PaHMG5, was found to be a pivotal activator of mating-type genes, while another gene, PaHMG9, acts as a repressor of certain phenomena specific to the stationary phase. The researchers discovered that PaHMG5 is at the center of a network of HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. This network also controls fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. The study suggests that HMG-box members play a critical role in sexual reproduction in fungi. The researchers also found that PaHMG5 and its ortholog, SpSte11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes, despite the two species diverging 550 million years ago. The study reveals a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi, with the P. anserina and S. pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor forming a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module in mammals. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role and relationships of HMG-box genes in P. anserina and sheds light on the evolution of sex regulation in eukaryotes.
In response to the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, an observational cohort study was conducted in Sierra Leone to investigate the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and the potential risk of transmission. The study aimed to address the urgent need for data on this topic, given the limited information available prior to the epidemic.

The study was implemented in two phases. The first phase, initiated within five months of initial protocol discussions, assessed the persistence of Ebola virus in the semen of 100 adult men. The second phase, which began shortly after, examined the persistence of the virus in multiple body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears, in 120 men and 120 women.

The study demonstrated that Ebola virus can persist in survivors' body fluids for extended periods, highlighting the need for semen testing programs among EVD survivors. The findings informed national and global guidelines in real-time and accelerated the implementation of such programs in EVD-affected countries. The study also informed research on the persistence of Zika virus.

The study's rapid implementation, despite challenging circumstances, was facilitated by strong community engagement and the availability of adequate resources. The results underscore the importance of research in informing public health responses to epidemics of poorly characterized diseases, emphasizing the need for timely allocation of resources to address critical research questions.
Researchers have developed a method to predict the chemical environments that bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, typically encounter in their natural habitats. This was achieved by analyzing dose-response curves from in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments of the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system. The chemotaxis sensory system allows bacteria to detect and migrate in chemical gradients of nutrients and toxins. The researchers used information theory and simulations to reevaluate the phenomenological Weber's law and its generalizations to the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection (FCD). They found that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient, or chemotactic index, and hence the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient.

The results suggest that chemotactic E. coli typically encounters exponential gradients in its natural habitat, as its pathway has evolved to maintain perception in these conditions. The researchers also found that broad distributions of exponential gradients lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. This study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The findings connect a large number of phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, shedding light on the chemical environments that bacteria encounter in their natural habitats.
Researchers have found that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for producing blood cells throughout a person's lifetime, have varying lifespans despite being genetically identical. The lifespan of an HSC is defined as the time it takes for the cell to produce all mature blood cells. Using a new model based on reliability theory, scientists have discovered that the lifespan of HSCs is influenced by the cell's ability to repair itself. The model suggests that HSCs experience small-scale failures at the molecular level, which are dissipated at the population level through repair processes. However, the repair capacity of HSCs is limited, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior, resulting in rapid clonal extinction. The study found that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitude and frequency of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics, with shorter and longer-lived HSCs differing significantly in their ability to dissipate perturbations. This suggests that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity. The findings have implications for understanding aging in HSCs and other non-homogenous cell systems, and may lead to new avenues for interpreting longitudinal network data. The study's approach does not rely on specific failure sources or repair mechanisms, making it a valuable tool for understanding stem cell biology.
Antibodies play a crucial role in protecting against chronic helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multicellular parasites were not well understood. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp). They found that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue-migrating larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection. Mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage, and accumulated fewer Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. The researchers also demonstrated that Hp-specific antibodies induced FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization. Furthermore, antibodies together with helminth larvae reprogrammed macrophages to express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, and the Arginase-1 product L-ornithine directly impaired larval motility. Notably, this antibody-induced expression of Arginase-1 occurred independently of IL-4Rα signaling. The study presents a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation that is antibody-dependent and mediates anti-helminth immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the early stages of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in living cells. The method, called ParB-INT, uses protein oligomerization to form visible foci without interfering with the repair process. This allows for the first real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. The study focused on the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III and observed the dynamics of a chromatin locus next to a DSB. The results showed that the damaged chromatin region is transiently confined during the early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. Resection in a yku70 mutant began approximately 10 minutes earlier than in wild-type cells, indicating the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. The study also revealed a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring the DSB early in the resection period. The ParB-INT visualization system allows for direct kinetic measurements on single cells, avoiding interference with the process under study, and is expected to be widely applicable to the study of fine-scale chromosome positioning and dynamics in various contexts, including gene expression, replication, and recombination.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in humans. They used the model to estimate the frequency and timing of reinfections in people living in areas where the disease is common. The model was based on data from two villages in Argentina, where 56% of the population had mixed infections with different genotypes of the parasite. The results showed that people in these areas are likely to be reinfected with T. cruzi at a rate of 0.032 per year, with most reinfections occurring during the chronic stage of the disease. The model also suggested that the parasite can evade the immune system in at least 20% of reinfection events. As a result, the risk of reinfection during the chronic stage of the disease is estimated to be around 14% after 5 years and 60% after 30 years, with most individuals being reinfected 1-3 times overall. The study found that the low rate of reinfections is more likely due to the inefficient transmission of the parasite through the feces of infected triatomine bugs (stercorarian mode) rather than a strong immune response. These findings have implications for the development of vaccines and our understanding of the increased risk of chronic disease manifestations in people living in endemic areas.
Researchers studied the immune responses of school-aged children in Thailand who were infected with dengue virus (DENV) to understand why some people develop severe symptoms while others remain asymptomatic. Blood samples were collected from the children before and after infection, and the production of 30 cytokines was measured in response to DENV stimulation. The results showed significant differences in cytokine production between children who developed symptomatic infection and those who had subclinical infection. Specifically, higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 were found in children who developed symptomatic infection, while lower levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were observed. Notably, IL-6 was produced by all children who developed symptomatic infection, but only 59% of those with subclinical infection. These findings suggest the existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles in response to DENV infection. The study's results may be useful for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines and understanding the mechanisms controlling differential clinical outcomes in DENV infection. The study's findings also highlight the potential role of IL-6 in dengue disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have reevaluated the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the development of the Drosophila wing disc, challenging the traditional view of Hh as a classical morphogen. A morphogen is a molecule that controls patterning by acting at a distance to regulate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In the Drosophila wing disc, Hh forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and Hh concentration thresholds has not been demonstrated.

Using mathematical modeling and in vivo experiments, the researchers found that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. They observed a spatial "overshoot" of the Hh gradient, a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. This overshoot results from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched (Ptc), and is required to distinguish different spatial domains of gene expression in response to Hh.

The researchers propose a new model of pattern formation that takes into account gradient dynamics to explain Hh-dependent patterning of the wing disc. This model suggests that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient, but rather by the dynamic interpretation of Hh signaling.
Researchers have identified a new mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) unc-79 gene. This mutation leads to hypersensitivity to acute ethanol exposure and altered responses to inhaled anesthetics in heterozygous mice. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lightweight heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. In addition, they are mildly hyperactive, consume more food, and have a leaner body composition compared to wild-type animals. Notably, Lightweight heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. These findings suggest a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans. The discovery of a conserved function of the mammalian unc-79 gene product provides new insights into the mechanisms by which ethanol and inhaled anesthetics influence the nervous system.
Researchers have identified the Anopheles gambiae immune response as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to control malaria transmission. The Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, has been shown to have potent anti-Plasmodium activity. Silencing the negative regulator of the Imd pathway, caspar, or over-expressing the Imd pathway-controlled NF-kappaB transcription factor, rel2, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes to Plasmodium falciparum, an etiological agent of human malaria.

To further understand the Imd pathway's role in anti-Plasmodium defense, researchers used RNA interference to silence caspar and other components of the pathway. They identified genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, which represent potential targets to achieve over-activation of the pathway. The study found that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts.

The researchers also demonstrated that silencing caspar alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response, even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. Furthermore, they established the relevance of Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense. These findings highlight the physiological considerations for implementing Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae to limit malaria transmission and reveal nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum.
Researchers investigated the potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) to treat pulmonary fibrosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection in mice. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition where lung tissue becomes scarred, leading to breathing difficulties. BMMSCs have been explored as a potential therapy for fibrotic diseases due to their anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. In this study, mice were infected with P. brasiliensis and then treated with BMMSCs or a combination of BMMSCs and the antifungal medication itraconazole (ITC). The results showed that BMMSCs did not have an anti-fibrotic effect, but instead exacerbated the condition. Histological analysis revealed an increase in granulomatous inflammatory areas and fibrocytes in the lungs of BMMSC-treated mice. Additionally, the expression of genes related to fibrosis, such as collagen and TGF-β3, was increased in these mice. In contrast, the combination of BMMSCs and ITC reduced the expression of certain genes involved in fibrosis. Furthermore, human fibroblasts treated with lung homogenates from infected and BMMSC-transplanted mice showed increased expression of collagen I. These findings suggest that BMMSCs may not be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by P. brasiliensis infection, and that their interaction with the fungus may even worsen the condition. However, the combination of BMMSCs and ITC showed promising results in reducing fibrosis-related gene expression.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotomine sand fly species that transmit Leishmania infantum, a parasite causing leishmaniasis, in the Mediterranean region. The study analyzed data from over 99,000 sand fly specimens collected from 37 sites in eight Mediterranean countries between 2011 and 2013. The results showed that the activity of sand flies is typically seasonal and sensitive to climate variations. The study found that the time of sand fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities varied in each location. Significant correlations were found between latitude and mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, as well as the type of density trend. A novel finding was a 3-modal trend recorded for P. tobbi in Cyprus. Adult sand flies ended their activity from mid-September to November, without significant correlation with latitude or mean annual temperature. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve, peaking in July-September and falling between early May and late October. No risk for leishmaniasis transmission was identified from December to March. The study also found a common pattern of nocturnal female activity, peaking between 11 pm and 2 am. The results provide a baseline for future investigations on sand fly population dynamics and may represent sentinel areas for monitoring leishmaniasis transmission in the region.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which causes scrub typhus, can infect and alter the behavior of human monocytes, a type of immune cell. When monocytes are exposed to O. tsutsugamushi, they undergo significant changes in gene expression, with over 4,500 genes being upregulated. This includes the production of type I interferon, which plays a key role in the immune response, as well as genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages, a type of immune cell that helps to fight off infections.

The study found that live O. tsutsugamushi is necessary to induce this response, and that heat-killed bacteria do not have the same effect. Monocytes infected with live O. tsutsugamushi also undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in a small percentage of cases. The researchers observed similar changes in gene expression in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus, including the upregulation of interferon-related genes and features of M1 polarization.

This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, a disease that is a significant public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region. The findings suggest that interferon-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype play a critical role in the disease. The study's results may also have implications for the development of new diagnostic tools for scrub typhus.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of ants to navigate complex environments using visual memory. Despite their small brain size, ants can learn and remember extended routes through intricate landscapes. Researchers have identified the mushroom body neuropils as a crucial memory circuit in the insect brain, but its function has primarily been studied in the context of simple olfactory association tasks. A new study explores whether a spiking neural model of the mushroom body circuit, originally developed to describe fruit fly olfactory learning, can also account for the ability of desert ants to learn visual routes through complex natural environments.

The researchers used a spiking neural simulation to model the ant's mushroom body circuit and found that it can learn and distinguish between on-route and off-route images in a realistic visual learning task. The model was able to learn over 80 on-route images and reliably distinguish them from similar images obtained when looking off-route. Notably, the model required minimal modification to perform this complex function, suggesting that the neural architecture of the insect mushroom body is capable of supporting navigation under realistic conditions. The study estimates that the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body is hundreds of independent images. These findings provide new insights into the neural basis of route memory in ants and suggest that the mushroom body circuit may be a key component of the ant's ability to navigate complex environments.
Researchers have identified a novel defense mechanism in plants, where infected leaves are shed to prevent the spread of disease. This process, called abscission, occurs in Arabidopsis plants when they are infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. The study found that the abscission response is triggered by the pathogen's effectors, which are proteins that help the bacteria infect the plant. The researchers discovered that several genes, including HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED, are required for the abscission response to occur.

The study also found that salicylic acid, a hormone involved in plant defense, plays a crucial role in regulating abscission. Plants with mutations in genes necessary for salicylic acid signaling, such as phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, and salicylic acid induction-deficient 2, failed to abscise their leaves normally. Additionally, plants with low levels of salicylic acid, such as NahG transgenic plants, also failed to abscise their leaves.

The researchers propose a threshold model, where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, the leaf is shed. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants and pathogens, and highlights the importance of abscission as a defense mechanism in plants. The findings also suggest that salicylic acid plays a key role in regulating both pathogen- and drought-triggered leaf abscission.
Researchers have identified a mechanism by which starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina detect the direction of motion in visual stimuli. SACs generate larger dendritic calcium signals when motion is towards their dendritic tips than in the opposite direction. To understand how this direction selectivity (DS) is computed, the researchers measured electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli using somatic whole-cell recordings and Fourier analysis. The results showed that fundamental and harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity in the response. This nonlinearity was found to be due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. The researchers also used two-photon microscopy to monitor calcium changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps and found that the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input. Compartmental modeling supported the conclusion that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination. The study found that DS persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential for direction selectivity. The results indicate that SACs can generate DS signals independently of lateral inhibitory interactions, relying on a dendrite-intrinsic mechanism involving voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms of pathogenesis, infective dose, and virulence in human parasites. They found that the number of pathogens required to infect a host, known as the infective dose, varies significantly across different pathogen species. The study suggests that pathogens using locally acting molecules to facilitate infection require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. However, contrary to expectations, pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators were not found to be more virulent. Instead, the study found a negative correlation between infective dose and virulence, meaning that pathogens with lower infective doses tend to be more virulent. Additionally, pathogens infecting hosts through wounded skin were found to have higher case fatality rates compared to those ingested or inhaled. The study analyzed data from 43 different human pathogens across various taxonomic groups, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses. The findings suggest that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationships between infective dose, virulence, and mode of transmission in human parasites.
Researchers studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. They used a novel bioinformatics tool to analyze the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult stages of the worm. The study found that the miR-277/4989 family targets were significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. A novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, was identified, and its proximity to sma-miR-277 suggests they form a miRNA cluster. The researchers propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs that are compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs was found to be up-regulated in adults, while their predicted targets were significantly down-regulated in paired adult worms but remained unchanged in immature females. The study also found that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells near the oesophagus gland and throughout the male worm's body. The results suggest that sma-miR-277/4989 may play a key role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and in the sexual development of female schistosomes. The study provides evidence for the role of miRNAs in the intra-mammalian development of this parasite and highlights the importance of miR-277/4989 in regulating gene expression changes underlying the development of juveniles and sexual maturation.
Researchers have conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The study aimed to investigate the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak. The researchers detected 11 new SARSr-CoV strains, in addition to four previously identified strains, and analyzed their full-length genomes. The results show that the SARSr-CoVs in this cave are highly diverse, particularly in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV were found in these regions, including the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, and the ORF3 and ORF8 regions. Recombination analysis revealed evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. The study suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences can use human ACE2 as the receptor, further highlighting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. The findings provide new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and emphasize the importance of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.
Current efforts to control human soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections involve periodic mass treatment with benzimidazole and imidothiazole drugs. However, high levels of resistance have developed to these drugs in livestock roundworms, highlighting the need to monitor drug efficacy in human STHs. The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), which measures faecal egg output pre- and post-drug treatment, is being examined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a means of detecting resistance. Researchers have investigated the potential impact of density-dependent fecundity on FECRT data. Density-dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon where the reproductive output of female worms increases as their population density decreases. This phenomenon has been observed in canine hookworms and is likely to apply to human STHs as well. The study found that female worms that survive drug treatment may increase their egg output significantly, leading to an underestimation of drug efficacy in the FECRT. This underestimation will vary depending on the initial worm density and the ability of the worms to increase their egg output. To improve the accuracy of drug efficacy measurements, researchers suggest omitting cases with the heaviest infections from the FECRT, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density-dependent constraints. The study highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods that examine direct drug effects on isolated worms or changes in worm genotypes.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) in lung development, specifically its impact on Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling and branching morphogenesis. They found that deleting HS synthetase Ext1 in epithelial cells resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number, associated with mesenchymal developmental defects. This was accompanied by increased FGF10 expression and FGF signaling activity, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism.

Further analysis revealed reduced SHH signaling activity in mutant lungs, which is responsible for suppressing FGF10 expression. Reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling. Importantly, the reduced SHH signaling activity was not due to decreased SHH expression or protein stability, but rather a reduction in the biologically active form of SHH proteins in both mutant epithelial cells and surrounding wild-type mesenchymal cells.

The study highlights the critical role of epithelial HS in regulating SHH signaling, which is essential for lung morphogenesis. The findings suggest that HS produced by epithelial cells is necessary for maintaining SHH signaling activity, and its loss leads to an FGF gain-of-function phenotype. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung development and highlights the importance of HS in dictating SHH-FGF10 signaling.
Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of paired-end sequencing strategies for detecting genome rearrangements in cancer. Paired-end sequencing is a technique that allows for the assessment of genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale. The study focused on detecting copy-neutral rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and can produce novel fusion genes. The researchers developed a formula to calculate the probability of detecting fusion genes in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences. They applied this formula to several breast cancer samples and found that they could accurately predict fusion genes with a relatively small number of large fragments. The study also demonstrated how the distribution of gene lengths and sequencing strategy parameters impact breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion gene detection, even in the presence of errors that suggest false rearrangements. The results of this study will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies. Paired-end sequencing of cancer genomes will provide highly reliable and precise detection of fusion genes, allowing for the systematic analysis of all classes of genomic events that lead to cancer. The study highlights the importance of maximizing the probability of detecting fusion genes with the least amount of sequencing, considering factors such as the number and length of end-sequenced clones, gene lengths, and possible errors in breakpoint localization.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells, which are able to sense the direction of chemical gradients and respond by polarizing and migrating towards attractants. The model consists of separate modules that account for motility, gradient sensing, and polarization, which are interrelated processes involved in chemotaxis. These modules are implemented in terms of reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell cortex.

The model includes a central excitable network that accounts for random migration, a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases the direction of excitability in response to stimuli, and a polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton. This allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and cells in gradients to gradually acquire distinct sensitivity between the front and back.

Simulations using the model demonstrate that the combination of these modules recreates most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells, including migration and changes in cellular morphology. The model also shows that adaptation is not absolutely required for chemotaxis, as cells without an adaptation mechanism can still perform efficient chemotaxis. The model's ability to simulate cell movement under various scenarios illustrates the complexity and sophistication of the chemotactic signaling machinery. The results suggest that chemotaxis is a consequence of an excitable network whose activity is biased in the direction of chemoattractant stimuli, and that the pathways governing chemotaxis have considerable redundancy at the biochemical level.
TDRD6, a protein essential for male fertility, plays a crucial role in the early steps of spliceosome maturation in primary spermatocytes. The study found that TDRD6 interacts with PRMT5, a protein that supports splicing, and SmB, a core protein of the spliceosome, in the absence of RNA. This interaction is dependent on arginine methylation. In the absence of TDRD6, the association of PRMT5 with SmB and the arginine methylation of SmB are significantly reduced. As a result, the assembly of spliceosomes is impaired, leading to a 3.5-fold increase in U5 snRNPs. This deficiency in spliceosome maturation also correlates with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies, which are involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes revealed a high number of splicing defects, including aberrant usage of introns and exons, as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. These findings demonstrate a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. The study suggests that TDRD6 may have acquired a role as a spliceosome assembly factor to ensure proper RNA splicing events, including those specific to spermatogenesis.
A new Bayesian model has been developed to study the acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization in hosts. The model provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing researchers to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Unlike previous approaches, this model does not rely on a fixed genetic distance threshold to determine the relationship between isolates. Instead, it uses a fully probabilistic approach that automatically provides uncertainty estimates for all relevant quantities.

The study of colonization dynamics is based on inferring whether bacteria from samples collected over time represent the same population or distinct colonization events. Whole genome sequencing has provided a detailed measure of genetic distance between isolates, which can be used to infer the relationship between them. However, previous methods have been inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates.

The new model uses a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to infer the relationship between isolates. It explicitly models the within-host variation using population genetic simulation. The model was validated with multiple simulations and demonstrated its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a large longitudinal clinical study. The R-code implementation of the method is freely available online.
Plants grow new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems, which initiate leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in a highly ordered pattern. The plant hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current research suggests that auxin transporters, specifically the PIN family, create local auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. However, different concepts have been proposed to explain how auxin transporters create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant. A major hypothesis, canalization, proposes that auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which could be initiated by local diffusion. Another hypothesis suggests that auxin is systematically transported towards areas with the highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN allocation in the membrane, one based on flux sensing and the other on local concentration sensing. To test these complex hypotheses, computational modeling was used to simulate auxin transport at the shoot meristem. The results show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis can explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. This hypothesis suggests that cells transport auxin from cell to cell, creating fluxes that lead to local hormone maxima and minima, which are interpreted in terms of differential gene expression and growth rates. The flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant.
Researchers have developed a more efficient approach to finding diagnostic biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. They combined high-quality genome sequences and bioinformatic tools with wet lab experiments to identify specific antigens that can be used in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Previous studies suggested that IgG1, a type of antibody, could be a biomarker for monitoring clinical status in RDTs, but using a crude lysate antigen (CLA) as a capturing antigen led to inconsistent results. The researchers replaced the CLA with specific antigens and used mass spectrometry to identify L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients. They then searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Using in silico algorithms, they mapped linear epitopes from the shortlisted proteins and screened predicted epitope peptides in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and non-endemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera. The results showed that over 90% of the proteins identified from immunoblots did not meet the selection criteria and were excluded from further analysis. However, the most reactive peptide had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 60-97%) for IgG1 with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes, and none of the NEHC sera were positive. This study demonstrates the potential of in silico searches to reduce the number of wet lab experiments and identify promising candidates for diagnostic biomarkers, which can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.
Researchers studied 317 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries: Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran. They found that 61.5% of cases had granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to infection. Of these, 25.2% were caseating granulomas, a type typically associated with mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis (TB). The study found that caseating granulomas were more common in Saudi Arabia and were associated with a slower healing process. In contrast, tuberculoid granulomas, which are non-necrotizing, were more common in other regions and were associated with a faster healing process. The researchers also found that the type of granuloma did not depend on the species of Leishmania, the parasite that causes CL. The study's findings suggest that CL should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, where both CL and TB are common. This is because 18.2% of CL cases in the study had caseating granulomas, which is a notable proportion. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering CL as a potential cause of caseating granulomas, especially in regions where both diseases are endemic.
Researchers have identified a gene called Zfp69 as a potential contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes in mice. This gene, which encodes a zinc finger domain transcription factor, is located on chromosome 4 and is associated with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) called Nidd/SJL. The Nidd/SJL QTL is linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice, particularly in the New Zealand Obese (NZO) strain.

The researchers used a positional cloning approach to identify the gene responsible for the diabetogenic effect of the Nidd/SJL QTL. They found that a critical interval on chromosome 4, approximately 2.1 megabases in length, was associated with the diabetic phenotype. Within this interval, they identified 10 genes, but only Zfp69 showed significant allelic variation between the NZO and diabetes-resistant C57BL/6J strains.

Further analysis revealed that a retrotransposon, IAPLTR1a, disrupted the Zfp69 gene in the NZO and C57BL/6J strains, resulting in a truncated mRNA that lacked essential coding sequences. In contrast, the diabetogenic alleles from the SJL, NON, and NZB strains produced a normal mRNA. When the diabetogenic Zfp69 allele was combined with the B6.V-Lepob background, it led to hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides.

The researchers also found that the human orthologue of Zfp69, ZNF642, was overexpressed in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that Zfp69 may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and that its expression in adipose tissue may contribute to the development of the disease.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signaling pathways that control the differentiation of T helper (Th) cells. Th cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the body's response to infection and disease. The model predicts that Th cells can differentiate into various subtypes, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, and that these subtypes can coexist with hybrid cell types that express a combination of markers from multiple subtypes.

The model uses a logical formalism to analyze the complex interactions between signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks that control Th cell differentiation. This approach allows researchers to identify stable states that correspond to the different Th cell subtypes and to understand how these subtypes interact with each other. The model also takes into account the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, simulating various prototypic environments to predict how Th cells respond to different conditions.

The researchers used an original model reduction approach to cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, and a stable state identification algorithm to identify the stable states corresponding to the different Th cell subtypes. The model highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes, and can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico. Overall, the model provides new insights into the complex processes that control Th cell differentiation and can be used to predict the behavior of Th cells in different environments.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict where and how transcription factors bind to the genome during early Drosophila development. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The model uses thermodynamic principles to evaluate the contribution of various biophysical forces to transcription factor binding, including DNA sequence, protein-DNA affinities, cooperativity, and competition among factors. The researchers applied the model to five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster and found that predictions based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone achieved a moderate correlation with experimental measurements of in vivo binding. However, incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into the model significantly improved the predictions, achieving a correlation of 0.6-0.9 for various factors across known target genes. The results suggest that in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions. The study provides a practical method for predicting transcription factor binding and a platform to understand the forces that shape quantitative variation in binding. The researchers applied the model to predict the genome-wide binding across 4,251 genes and found a strong relation between the model's ability to accurately predict binding and gene expression levels.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates cell growth and proliferation in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. The study focuses on the basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors, specifically the E protein family and their inhibitors, the Id proteins. These factors play a crucial role in controlling the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. In Drosophila, the E protein orthologue Daughterless (Da) and the Id orthologue Extramacrochaetae (Emc) are the only members of these classes of bHLH proteins.

The study reveals that Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which in turn represses the transcription of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Cdc25 is a key activator of the G2/M transition, a critical step in the cell cycle that leads to cell division. The researchers found that ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. This suggests that Emc and Da play a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that control organ growth and development, which is essential for understanding both physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer. The findings also highlight the importance of the interaction between E proteins and Id factors in regulating cell fate decisions in different developmental contexts.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline to analyze phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments and identify key proteins involved in signaling networks. Phosphoproteomics is a technique that measures the relative levels of protein phosphorylation, a crucial mechanism of signal transduction in cells. However, phosphoproteomics has limitations due to the limited number of detectable phosphorylation sites per protein. To address this, the researchers created a pipeline that combines phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery to identify proteins involved in specific pathways. They applied this pipeline to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) data generated using the SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with kinase-dead mutations. The analysis identified 5 high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins involved in stress responses, including 9 proteins with direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. Four of the predicted proteins were validated through interventional phenotypic experiments, showing differential invasive growth. This pipeline provides a systematic approach for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. The researchers anticipate that this methodology can be applied to other interventional studies using different experimental platforms. The study demonstrates the potential of interventional phosphoproteome studies to provide new insights into signaling pathways involved in biological processes, such as yeast filamentous growth.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species. They found that the X chromosome does not undergo dosage compensation, a process that equalizes X and autosomal gene expression, in most of the male germline. This contradicts previous reports suggesting that dosage compensation occurs in the Drosophila male germline. The study also found no evidence for meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), a process that silences and condenses the X chromosome during meiosis in the male germline.

The researchers used microarray analysis to examine gene expression in Drosophila testes and found that the expression of X-linked genes is reduced compared to autosomal genes. However, this reduction is not due to MSCI, as previously thought. Instead, the reduced expression of X-linked genes is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The study suggests that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X chromosome during spermatogenesis in Drosophila.

The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila. They also highlight the complexity of X chromosome regulation in the male germline and the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms. The study's results provide new insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes and the regulation of gene expression in the Drosophila male germline.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse model for the human diarrheal infection caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). They found that the development of colonic A/E lesions, which determine the severity of infection, originates from a limited number of single-bacterial epithelial infection events that occur within the first 18 hours of infection. These early-established lesions trigger a local innate immune response that protects the epithelium from new A/E lesion formation by luminal bacteria, thus determining disease severity and outcome.

The researchers discovered that colonic A/E lesions are clonal bacterial populations that depend on local clonal growth to persist, rather than continuous re-infection from the luminal compartment. They also found that the epithelium-adherent population of C. rodentium is derived from a small founder population of one bacterium per microcolony, making it subject to a population bottleneck.

The study suggests that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis is restricted to a short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. The innate immune response, mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling, is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights into the early dynamics and control of A/E lesion development and highlight the importance of early bacteria-host interactions in determining the outcome of C. rodentium infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or gene variants, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and genomic epidemiology, where complete sampling is often not feasible. The new method, based on Bayesian inference, takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. It also provides a way to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates.

The method is particularly useful for estimating the overlap between two populations when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known. This is a special case of the β-diversity problem, which is relevant in the study of malaria and other diseases. The method can also be used prospectively in study planning to determine the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.

In contrast to existing methods, which are often non-probabilistic and can be biased, the new method provides a firm statistical foundation for estimating overlap from incomplete samples. It can be applied to various contexts, including the study of Plasmodium spp. multigene antigen families and general studies of β-diversity in multigene families. The method can be improved by incorporating larger whole-genome datasets as prior information, allowing for more accurate estimates of overlap.
Eukaryotic protein kinases play a crucial role in regulating various cellular functions by phosphorylating targeted protein substrates. The active state of these enzymes involves a highly conserved catalytic core that oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. However, the intramolecular interactions regulating these mechanics were not well understood. Researchers used cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model to investigate these interactions using biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques. They identified a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work together to regulate the active state mechanics. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and the αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Contrary to previous assumptions, the study found that the highly conserved β3-lysine is not essential for phosphoryl transfer, but rather plays a structural role in facilitating the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking it with the αC-helix. The researchers also showed that the active state mechanics can be regulated through the R-spine and Shell in the absence of the salt bridge and electrostatic interaction. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic protein kinases and highlight the importance of the β3-lysine in facilitating the active state mechanics.
American Samoa conducted mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000 to 2006. After MDA, the World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) to assess recent LF transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged 8 years and older. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools, and a cluster survey was conducted in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. The school-based survey identified nine antigen-positive children, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7%, while the community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2%. The study found that CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school-based survey had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. In contrast, the community-based survey identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. The study confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA.
Researchers studied how zebrafish determine their sex and found that oocytes, or egg cells, play a crucial role in maintaining the female sex phenotype in adult zebrafish. In zebrafish, sex determination is a complex process influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The study focused on two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Bmp15 and Gdf9, and their potential role in female sex determination and maintenance.

The researchers generated targeted mutations in the genes for Bmp15 and Gdf9 and observed that females deficient in Bmp15 began developing normally but switched sex during the mid-to-late juvenile stage and became fertile males. This suggests that Bmp15 is essential for maintaining the female sex phenotype in zebrafish. The study also found that estrogen production is necessary for female development and that Bmp15 likely regulates estrogen biosynthesis by promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle.

The researchers propose a model in which the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes the expression of the cyp19a1a gene, which is responsible for estrogen production. Consistent with this model, the somatic gonad expresses probable receptors for Bmp15. The study provides the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish and identifies a genetic pathway required for female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish that is likely conserved in other fish species.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling the development of animals by regulating the expression of target genes along the anterior-posterior body axis. To achieve high-regulatory specificity, Hox proteins often co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a highly context-specific manner. Researchers have identified a few of these factors, but a large number are still unknown. This study focuses on the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) in Drosophila. The results show that Dfd requires at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators to properly regulate rpr expression in a specific subset of cells in the maxillary segment. The study suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs) are responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. The findings imply that a large number of transcription factors are directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo. This study contributes to our understanding of how Hox proteins regulate gene expression in a highly localized manner, and highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions between Hox proteins and other transcription factors in achieving proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets.
Researchers investigated the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive plant NB-LRR intracellular innate immune receptor, ADR1-L2. ADR1-L2 is a coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein that functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in plant defense responses. The study found that ADR1-L2 can act as a "helper" to transduce specific microbial activation signals from "sensor" NB-LRRs, and this helper activity does not require an intact P-loop. The researchers generated an autoactive missense mutation, ADR1-L2D484V, which leads to dwarfed plants with increased disease resistance and constitutively high SA levels. The morphological phenotype also requires an intact P-loop, suggesting that these ADR1-L2D484V phenotypes reflect canonical activation of this NB-LRR protein. Signaling from ADR1-L2D484V does not require NADPH oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. Transcriptional regulation of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs, which are both SA-dependent and -independent. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA-gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling. Importantly, ADR1-L2D484V autoactivation signaling is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways. The study proposes a genetic model that provides insight into an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop, which includes ADR1-L2.
Researchers have investigated the role of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, a plant species, and its interaction with the MORC6 protein. MORC6 is known to mediate transcriptional silencing, but the mechanisms behind this process were unclear. The study found that two components of the RdDM pathway, SUVH9 and IDN2, interact with MORC6 and contribute to transcriptional silencing. SUVH9 and its homolog SUVH2 can either work together with MORC6 or enhance its activity to silence gene expression. IDN2 also interacts with MORC6 and is involved in silencing a subset of MORC6-targeted loci. Other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing at a subset of MORC6-targeted loci. Additionally, the study found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 and SUVH9, and mediate transcriptional silencing. These findings suggest that RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, which enhances transcriptional silencing at methylated genomic regions. The study demonstrates that MORC6 interacts with IDN2 and the SWI/SNF complex to mediate heterochromatin condensation, linking DNA methylation to heterochromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in vertebrate development using zebrafish as a model. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that helps buffer genetic variation and protect against developmental malformations. The study found that compromising Hsp90 function in zebrafish revealed previously unobserved developmental anomalies, including severe structural eye malformations reminiscent of human conditions such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex. In some cases, Hsp90 inhibition increased the severity of a recessive eye phenotype, while in others, it decreased it. The study also found that inbreeding of offspring from selected unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies, indicating an oligogenic nature of the phenotype. Unlike in Drosophila, Hsp90 inhibition in zebrafish decreased developmental stability, as indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia and sunrise phenotypes. The study suggests that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies where the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role. The findings imply that Hsp90 plays a buffering role in the variability of certain mutant phenotypes, and compromising its function may alter the severity or penetrance of some defined traits without affecting overall development.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminally acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, a common modification found throughout the tree of life. The study analyzed amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. The results show that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. A rule, referred to as the (X)PX rule, was identified as the sole determinant for N-terminal acetylation, indicating that certain amino acid sequences prevent acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation. The researchers developed a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies. The (X)PX rule appears to be conserved among organisms, suggesting that it can be applied to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in various species. The study provides a straightforward strategy to systematically investigate the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. The findings have implications for understanding the biological functions of N-terminal acetylation, which cannot be predicted from the primary amino acid sequence.
Researchers studied how RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) controls the termination of tRNA gene transcription in living cells. This process is crucial for producing abundant tRNAs during cell growth, development, and cancer. However, the mechanisms used by RNAP III to terminate transcription were not well understood. To address this, the researchers used a genetic screen to identify mutations in the RNAP III subunit Rpc1 that affected termination. They found 122 point mutations that clustered in specific regions of the enzyme, including the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, and the pore and funnel. These mutations led to increased elongation rates and terminator readthrough, suggesting a kinetic coupling model where elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. The researchers also found that cells with these mutations produced more RNA than wild-type cells, which could not be explained by their increased elongation rate alone. This suggests that the mutations activated RNAP III for overall transcription. The study's findings indicate that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including the C11 subunit, are key determinants of termination and that some mutations can activate RNAP III for increased transcription. These results have implications for understanding the role of RNAP III in cancer, as similar mutations have been found in spontaneous cancer cells.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains, which play a crucial role in cell signaling. The method uses the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm to identify potential interactions. The approach was tested against experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices, and it performed similarly in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. The researchers used their method to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. They validated the predictions using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling. The researchers also showed that the FoldX algorithm can predict the in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phosphopeptide complexes, including nine different SH2 domains, and can be used for genome-wide predictions. The study suggests that the FoldX algorithm is a useful alternative to peptide library experiments for predicting SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) that can dissolve toxic amyloids in the brain, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These amyloids are formed when a protein called tau accumulates in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells and cognitive decline. CyP40 is a type of enzyme called a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which helps to regulate the structure of proteins. The study found that CyP40 can interact with tau and other aggregating proteins that contain proline residues, a type of amino acid that is common in intrinsically disordered proteins like tau. When CyP40 interacts with these proteins, it can break them apart and prevent them from forming toxic amyloids.

In experiments using a mouse model of tau accumulation, the researchers found that overexpressing CyP40 in the brain reduced the amount of toxic tau oligomers and tangles, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function. The study also used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to show that CyP40 interacts with tau at specific sites rich in proline residues. Furthermore, the researchers found that CyP40 can interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins that contain prolines, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of amyloid formation and suggest that strategies to induce or deliver CyP40 to the brain could be used to halt or even rescue cognitive deficits associated with neurotoxic amyloids.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation and maintenance of heterocyst patterns in cyanobacteria filaments. Heterocysts are specialized cells that form in response to nitrogen deprivation, allowing the filament to survive in environments with limited nitrogen availability. The model combines the genetic regulatory network of cyanobacteria with the principles of systems biology, incorporating the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament and the dynamical properties of the underlying genetic circuit of each individual cell.

The model simulates the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions, such as nitrogen deprivation, and the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their respective genetic circuits via molecular diffusion. The results show that the model can reproduce the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and maintenance as observed experimentally. The study highlights the importance of noise in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heterocyst patterns for a wide range of model parameters. This suggests that cyanobacteria filaments have evolved an efficient response to the noisy conditions found in their natural environment.

The model consists of a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of the concentrations of relevant molecular products. By incorporating both diffusion and noisy external conditions, the model provides a comprehensive understanding of the principles underlying heterocyst pattern formation and maintenance in cyanobacteria filaments.
A study conducted in Cameroon aimed to investigate the relationship between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program, their beliefs about onchocerciasis, and their adherence to ivermectin treatment in three regions with high onchocerciasis prevalence. The study found that people's perceptions of the CDTI program were more strongly associated with adherence to ivermectin than their beliefs about onchocerciasis. Specifically, individuals who had a positive opinion of the ivermectin distribution campaigns and believed that community drug distributors were committed to their work were more likely to adhere to the treatment. In contrast, those who held misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as believing that the disease is caused by poor hygiene or high sugar intake, were less likely to adhere to the treatment. The study also found that there are still frequent misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission in Cameroon, including the belief that onchocerciasis is caused by high sugar intake, which was prevalent in one of the study regions. The findings suggest that in addition to education and sensitization on onchocerciasis and ivermectin use, local health authorities should also focus on implementing the CDTI program in a way that promotes community ownership and ensures the effective work of community drug distributors. This approach may help improve adherence to ivermectin treatment and ultimately contribute to the elimination of onchocerciasis in Cameroon.
Researchers investigated the relationship between DNA methylation, genetic variants, and protein biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. They analyzed data from over 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions in relation to 121 protein biomarkers. The study used epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation, SNPs, and protein biomarkers.

The results showed that DNA methylation was associated with 188 protein biomarkers, with 124 loci containing at least one probe that is not likely to cross-hybridize in the genome. However, the study found no strong evidence that DNA methylation is directly causal for disease pathogenesis. Instead, the associations between DNA methylation and protein biomarkers are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects of the pathogenesis of disease.

The study also found that SNPs identified in the GWAS accounted for a significant fraction of the heritability of some biomarkers, but DNA methylation did not explain any part of the heritability. Additionally, cis-regulatory SNPs for some biomarkers had a direct effect on DNA methylation levels, but DNA methylation did not have a direct effect on biomarker levels. The results suggest that DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases.
Researchers have discovered that the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can directly impair the function of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting viral infections. In laboratory experiments, VZV was found to potently inhibit the ability of NK cells to respond to target cells, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment was observed not only in NK cells that were infected with VZV, but also in uninfected NK cells that were exposed to VZV in culture. The researchers found that direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected cells was necessary for the impairment of NK cell function.

Further analysis revealed that VZV disrupted the signaling pathway that allows NK cells to respond to target cells, preventing them from releasing cytotoxic granules and producing cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor. The researchers also found that the closely related virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), was able to infect NK cells and render them unresponsive to target cell stimulation, although it affected cytokine production differently than VZV. These findings provide new insights into how VZV manipulates the immune response and highlight a previously unreported strategy employed by the virus to evade the immune system.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanism behind apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented alternately at different locations create the perception of a stimulus moving between them. They found that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. This effect, known as AM masking, is strongest when the target orientation matches the orientation of the inducers.

A population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model, was developed to understand the neural effects of AM. The model predicts that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to cause masking or be perceived as motion. Instead, it suggests that AM suppresses early sensory responses, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding.

Predictive coding models propose that higher-level predictions of motion are generated, which "explain away" lower-level responses to expected sensory input. The study found that orientation-tuned suppression of responses in early visual cortex is the major cause of AM masking. This suppression is thought to occur when a stimulus presented on the AM path is predictable, meaning its features match those of the apparently moving stimulus and it appears at a consistent time and place.

The results suggest that AM masking is not necessarily due to increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, but rather to the suppression of responses to predictable stimuli. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying AM and the role of predictive coding in visual processing.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding how the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax activates the IKK-NF-κB pathway, a key process in the transformation of CD4+ T cells. Tax, a protein encoded by the HTLV-1 virus, plays a crucial role in promoting cell proliferation and survival by activating the IKK-NF-κB pathway. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IKK activation has been unclear due to the complexity of the process.

Using a cell-free system, scientists were able to reconstitute Tax-stimulated IKK activation and identify the essential cellular components involved. They found that Tax acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, working with specific E2 enzymes to assemble mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These chains directly activate the IKK complex by binding to its NEMO subunit.

This discovery sheds light on the biochemical function of Tax in IKK activation and clarifies the confusion surrounding HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation. The study reveals that Tax hijacks minimal cellular ubiquitination components to activate IKK-NF-κB, which in turn induces the production of cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. This understanding may lead to the development of therapeutics for ATL (Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) and TSP/HAM (Tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy), diseases caused by HTLV-1 infection.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to establish a new population (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They analyzed data from a wide range of species, including invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates, and found a consistent positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment success. However, the strength of this effect varied depending on the number of individuals introduced, with the greatest impact observed when 10-100 individuals were introduced. The study also found that different analytical approaches used in previous studies contributed to the variation in effect sizes, with animal introductions showing larger effect sizes than plant introductions. In contrast, the scale of study (field to global) and methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used did not influence the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success. The analysis revealed a remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success. This study provides the first quantitative systematic review of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success, shedding light on the factors that influence the success of alien species introductions.
Interleukin 17A (IL-17) plays a significant role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Research has shown that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding these mediators by altering the interaction between AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) and microRNA16 (miR16). AUBPs target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs, facilitating either mRNA decay or stabilization. In the presence of miR16, AUBPs and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex, leading to mRNA degradation. However, IL-17 reduces miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBPs over destabilizing AUBPs, resulting in reduced mRNA decay. This suggests that miR16, independent of its seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBPs for target mRNAs. The interaction between AUBPs, miR16, and target mRNAs depends on specific RNA sequences and structural restraints. IL-17's function is mediated by changing the contribution of miR16 and AUBPs. The study found that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CSF, which are pro-inflammatory mediators. The findings indicate that modulation of AUBP-miR16 mediated regulation of gene expression by IL-17 depends on the specific mRNA target, limiting miR16 usage and differential participation of AUBPs.
Researchers in Uganda investigated the relationship between bovine and human trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, in newly affected areas of the country. The study focused on two districts, Kaberamaido and Dokolo, where the disease has been spreading rapidly due to the movement of infected cattle. The researchers collected blood samples from cattle in villages that had reported cases of sleeping sickness and those that had not. They found a significant association between the presence of the parasite T. brucei s.l. in cattle and the likelihood of detecting the human-infective form of the parasite, T. b. rhodesiense, in the same village. The study showed that villages with a higher prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in their cattle herds were more likely to have T. b. rhodesiense present. The researchers also found that cattle aged 18-36 months and over 36 months were more likely to be infected with T. brucei s.l. than younger cattle. The study suggests that the presence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle can be used as an indicator of the risk of T. b. rhodesiense transmission to humans in a village setting. The findings have implications for public health efforts to control the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.
Researchers have investigated the role of the NSL complex in regulating gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. The NSL complex is composed of four subunits: NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis revealed that the majority (85.5%) of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. These genes are characterized by increased levels of histone modifications, including H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac, in their promoter regions. Additionally, NSL-targeted genes have a well-defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns.

The study found that the NSL complex is required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to NSL target gene promoters. Depletion of NSL1 and NSL3 resulted in reduced Pol II binding and compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters. Furthermore, genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication-related Element (DRE). The results suggest that the NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in Drosophila by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription. The study provides insights into the mechanism of action of the NSL complex, which is conserved from Drosophila to mammals, and has implications for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of the DUX4 gene. The model mimics the epigenetic and DUX4 expression patterns seen in FSHD patients and controls, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, incomplete epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and variegated DUX4 expression in muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. The researchers generated two transgenic mouse lines: one carrying a D4Z4 genomic region from a contracted pathogenic FSHD1 allele and one carrying a normal-sized, non-pathogenic allele. The data suggest that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism and that contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. The mouse model accurately models the difference between FSHD patients and control individuals, with the contracted D4Z4 repeats showing relative chromatin relaxation and increased DUX4 expression. This model will be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and for testing new therapeutic intervention strategies, such as RNA interference to reverse the detrimental effects of DUX4 expression in muscle.
Researchers have developed a new malaria vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) Quadvax (QV), by combining four diverse allelic proteins. This approach aims to overcome the limitation of current AMA1 vaccines, which only provide protection against closely related parasite strains. The QV vaccine elicited polyclonal antibodies in rabbits that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum. In comparison to a strain-specific, monovalent 3D7 AMA1 vaccine, QV induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. These mAbs were ∼10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Another novel mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. The identified novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes can form the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines. Vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes.
Researchers have identified a mechanism that precisely times the displacement of the mitotic spindle during cell division in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. This displacement is crucial for unequal cell division, where one daughter cell receives more genetic material than the other. The team found that the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) work together to time spindle displacement. They discovered that reducing the function of the proteasome, APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delays spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometaphase causes the spindle to displace early. By experimentally unlinking spindle displacement from this timing mechanism, the researchers observed premature displacement of incompletely assembled components of the mitotic spindle. This suggests that the delay in spindle displacement ensures that the spindle does not begin to move until it is fully assembled. The study demonstrates that mitotic progression times spindle displacement in the asymmetric division of an animal cell for the first time. The researchers speculate that this link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division might be evolutionarily conserved, as the mitotic spindle is displaced at a similar stage of mitosis during asymmetric cell divisions in diverse systems.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes that have adapted to high-altitude living in two populations: Tibetans and Andeans. These populations have lived at high altitudes for thousands of years and have developed unique physiological adaptations to cope with low oxygen levels. The study aimed to uncover the genetic basis of these adaptations.

The researchers analyzed the genomes of Tibetans and Andeans to identify regions with previously unknown functions related to high-altitude phenotypes. They also examined genes involved in oxygen metabolism and sensing, such as the HIF pathway, RAS, and globin family of genes. Four population genetic statistics were used to detect signatures of natural selection.

The study found that the genetic adaptations of Tibetans and Andeans are distinct from each other, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. One gene, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), which is important in cellular oxygen sensing, showed evidence of positive selection in both populations, but with different patterns of variation. The study identified several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes responsible for adaptation to high altitude in both populations, as well as different chromosomal regions implicated in the putative response to selection.

These findings suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide a basis for future studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude. The study contributes to the understanding of the genetic and evolutionary architecture of adaptation to altitude and provides insight into the genes responsible for human phenotypic diversity.
Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) pose a significant threat to cell survival and can lead to genetic instability. The efficient and precise repair of DSBs is crucial, but faulty repair can result in mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near a DSB can alter the repair pathway from accurate gene conversion to break-induced replication (BIR), leading to genetic instability. IRs can form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) formed by DSB resection. The type of structure formed depends on the length of the spacer separating the IRs, with long (1-kb) spacers leading to inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) and short (12-bp) spacers resulting in intra-molecular SSA. Both types of structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and promote BIR. The processing of these structures involves different protein complexes, with the MRX-Sae2 complex processing fold-back structures with short loops and the Rad1-Rad10 complex processing those with long loops. The presence of IRs near a DSB promotes BIR and decreases the frequency of gene conversion, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. Given the abundance of IRs in the human genome, these findings may contribute to understanding IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with human disease.
Researchers have developed a new animal model using Drosophila melanogaster to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured, multicellular communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. The researchers infected Drosophila with P. aeruginosa and found that the bacteria formed biofilms in the fly's crop, which had a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. The biofilms formed in vivo had increased antibiotic resistance compared to planktonically grown cells. The researchers also found that biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a mutant that lacked these genes was unable to form biofilms and was more virulent than the wild-type strain. In contrast, a hyperbiofilm strain was less virulent than the wild-type strain. The researchers also found that biofilm formation was associated with the induction of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the fly. This study provides new insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa oral infection of Drosophila and highlights the use of Drosophila as an infection model for studying P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo.
Researchers studied the vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a) in mice and voles to understand how genetic variations contribute to differences in brain gene expression and behavior. The Avpr1a gene is responsible for mediating vasopressin-mediated social behaviors, and its expression patterns vary significantly between and within species. The study found that the proximal 5' flanking region of the Avpr1a gene contributes modestly to species differences in vasopressin receptor (V1aR) distribution in the brain. However, the majority of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene.

The researchers also investigated the role of a polymorphic microsatellite element within the 5' flanking region of the vole Avpr1a gene. They found that this microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring a subset of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This is the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles.

The study suggests that the vole Avpr1a is an ideal model locus for exploring the genomic mechanisms contributing to diversity in brain gene expression and behavior. The findings provide a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level. However, the results also indicate that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene.
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in class switch recombination (CSR) and chromosomal translocations, such as those found in Burkitt's lymphomas, by inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin switch (S) regions and the c-MYC oncogene. Researchers used a yeast model system to study the mechanisms of AID-mediated genome instability. They found that AID induces DSBs at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences, leading to chromosomal translocations via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This process was enhanced in yeast THO mutants, which are impaired in messenger RNA (mRNP) biogenesis and form stable R-loops. The study suggests that AID-mediated deamination of cytosines at S sequences is channeled into DSBs by the Ung1 activity, similar to mammalian B cells. The c-MYC oncogene also acts as a hotspot of recombination in yeast THO mutants. The findings provide new insights into the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. The study demonstrates that yeast cells, like mammalian B cells, have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and CSR. This research opens new perspectives in understanding AID-mediated rearrangements and provides a validated assay to study the molecular mechanisms leading to DSBs at S regions and the c-MYC oncogene.
Researchers have investigated how Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells divide their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly localized. In E. coli, cell division and chromosome replication must be coordinated to produce viable offspring. However, cells can still divide successfully even if their cell division plane is misplaced. The study used quantitative time-lapse imaging to observe how E. coli cells partition their chromosomes during asymmetric divisions. The results show that the protein FtsK can pump up to 80% of the chromosome (3.7 megabases of DNA) from one daughter compartment to another at an average rate of 1700 base pairs per second. This process occurs mainly at the late stages of cell division, when the cell division protein ZipA has already dissociated from the septum and the septum has closed to a narrow channel. The narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK. The study also found that the timing of translocation may be determined by FtsK's ability to bind to DNA when the septum is not closed. The results suggest that E. coli cells can reposition their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly localized, and that DNA located within the constriction realizes a cell-cycle checkpoint that prevents daughters from separating from each other.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to optimize the selection of peptides for epitope-based vaccines (EVs). EVs are a type of vaccine that targets specific parts of a pathogen, known as epitopes, to elicit an immune response. However, selecting the optimal set of epitopes is a complex task due to the variability of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in individuals, which affects how epitopes are recognized by the immune system.

The proposed framework uses integer linear programming (ILP) to identify the set of epitopes that maximizes the likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response. This approach allows for the incorporation of various immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to different definitions of a "good vaccine."

The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing it to a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm. The ILP approach outperforms these methods and can solve typical problem sizes in seconds. The framework can also be applied to personalized vaccines, where the optimal set of epitopes is tailored to an individual's specific MHC alleles.

The proposed framework is the first to provide provably optimal solutions to the vaccine design problem for EVs. It does not suggest a single optimal epitope selection strategy, but rather provides a mathematical framework that can be used to identify the optimal set of epitopes for a given definition of a "good vaccine."
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue. IL-7 is a cytokine present in semen, and its concentration is higher in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. The study used an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue to simulate an in vivo situation, depositing HIV-1 on the tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable to those found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. The results showed that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues revealed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells. The study suggests that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may facilitate the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection. The findings imply that IL-7 may play a significant role in male-to-female HIV-1 transmission, making the female lower genital tract mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition.
Researchers studied how the Zika virus (ZIKV) interacts with the RNA interference (RNAi) response in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells. RNAi is a defense mechanism that helps control arbovirus infections in mosquitoes. The study found that ZIKV induces the production of two types of small RNAs: virus-specific siRNAs and piRNA-like molecules. However, the piRNA-like molecules lacked the characteristic signature of typical piRNAs.

The researchers focused on the exogenous siRNA (exo-siRNA) pathway, which is considered the key mosquito antiviral response mechanism. They found that ZIKV-specific siRNAs were produced and loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2), but silencing Ago2 did not enhance virus replication. In contrast, enhanced ZIKV replication was observed in a Dcr2-knockout cell line, suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway is involved in the antiviral response.

The study also investigated the role of PIWI proteins, which are involved in the piRNA pathway. While ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs were detected, they lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and were bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of PIWI proteins did not enhance ZIKV replication, except for Piwi4, which displayed antiviral activity.

The researchers also found that the expression of ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike yellow fever virus capsid protein, it did not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. Overall, the study provides new insights into ZIKV-mosquito RNAi interactions that are important for understanding its spread.
A recent study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, investigated the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by the Sporothrix genus. The researchers analyzed 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and found that Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with atypical clinical presentations, such as disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection. In contrast, patients infected with Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto presented with less severe and more localized disease, similar to the majority of previously described sporotrichosis cases. The study also found that patients infected with S. brasiliensis required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment compared to those infected with S. schenckii. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between genotypic identification of Sporothrix species and clinical aspects of human sporotrichosis. The findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. The study adds new information to the knowledge base on S. brasiliensis disease and supports the importance of careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts were unclear. Researchers used RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to investigate the quantity and composition of transcripts in human and mouse tissues. They found that RNA-Seq identified fewer transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs compared to tiling arrays. Most non-exonic transcribed regions are located within introns, suggesting they may be fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of many intergenic transcribed regions are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. The researchers identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes, through reads that bridge splice sites.

The majority of intergenic transcribed regions have low sequence coverage, with 70-80% of the transcribed area detected by a single RNA-Seq read in only one sample. This is consistent with random placement. Tiling arrays are not well-suited to detect transcripts expressed at low levels. The researchers found that most non-exonic transcripts in RNA-Seq data are associated with known genes, including thousands of new alternative exons and hundreds of alternative promoters. A genome-wide analysis revealed 2,789 previously uncharacterized transcript fragments with no overlap with exons of known gene annotations, 1,259 of which map to intergenic regions. The intergenic regions that are transcribed above background levels consist of a mix of coding and non-coding transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the thermostability of a protein called the Bacillus subtilis YtvA LOV domain. This protein is a type of fluorescent protein that is based on a molecule called flavin mononucleotide. The new method combines computer simulations with experimental testing to identify mutations that make the protein more stable at high temperatures. By applying this method, the researchers were able to increase the protein's thermostability by 31 degrees Celsius, making it suitable for use in thermophilic systems.

The method involves five steps: computer screening to identify potential mutations, experimental testing to confirm the results, computational redesign to optimize the mutations, experimental reevaluation, and combining multiple mutations. This approach was found to be effective, with a success rate of 62% in identifying thermostable mutants. The researchers identified eight thermostable sites on the protein, five of which are located at the interface between protein subunits, suggesting that stronger interactions between subunits can improve thermostability.

The most thermostable mutant identified had a melting temperature of 54.2 degrees Celsius, which is significantly higher than the wild-type protein. The researchers also found that combining multiple mutations can further improve thermostability, with about a dozen mutants showing higher stability than the wild-type protein. This new method provides a useful tool for improving protein thermostability, which is essential for studying anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones.
Researchers conducted a study on the diversity of Lutzomyia sand flies and their infection rates with Leishmania and Wolbachia on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. The study aimed to identify the sand fly species present, their evolutionary relationships, and their infection status with Leishmania and Wolbachia. The researchers collected and sorted sand flies from the island's understory and used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae species. They found 18 species, including two possible "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis and Lu. gomezi.

The study detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi, and 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. The Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi had identical ITS-1 sequences, which were 93% similar to Leishmania (viannia) naiffi, a species previously unknown in Panama. The researchers also detected distinct strains of Wolbachia in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. The study suggests that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species, and that Le. naiffi may have recently expanded its range to include the Isthmus of Panama. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies this species as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is a significant clinical concern due to its devastating consequences. Researchers have investigated the triggers of HCMV reactivation and found that the mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK) family plays a crucial role in this process. Specifically, MSK-mediated reactivation is dependent on the binding of the transcription factor CREB to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). CREB binding to the MIEP serves as a target for MSK recruitment, allowing the kinase to phosphorylate histone H3. This phosphorylation event is necessary for histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. The study suggests that CREB binding to the MIEP is essential for the recruitment of MSK's kinase activity, which initiates chromatin remodeling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Furthermore, CREB acts as a classical transcription factor, promoting chromatin modifications conducive to viral gene expression. Inhibiting the interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a therapeutic strategy for preventing HCMV reactivation. The study used an adenovirus vector approach to directly associate the ERK-MSK relationship with CREB-histone H3 phosphorylation and the induction of IE gene expression from latency. The results show that IE gene expression from latency in DCs is sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition, and reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of histones bound to the latent MIEP.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the protein Nol11 in the development of craniofacial structures in the frog Xenopus. Nol11 is involved in the production of ribosomes, which are essential for all living cells. Defects in ribosome production have been linked to various inherited disorders, known as ribosomopathies. The study found that Nol11 is highly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest, a group of cells that gives rise to craniofacial cartilages. Knocking down Nol11 in Xenopus resulted in impaired ribosome production, increased cell death, and abnormal development of craniofacial cartilages.

The researchers also found that inhibiting the protein p53, which is involved in cell death, rescued the craniofacial phenotype but not the underlying ribosome production defect. This suggests that the body has an evolutionary conserved mechanism to remove cells with impaired ribosome production. However, excessive activation of this mechanism can lead to impaired craniofacial development. The study provides new insights into the relationship between ribosome production and craniofacial cell survival and development. The findings also establish Xenopus as a useful model organism for studying ribosomopathies and the development of craniofacial structures. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Nol11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development.
Researchers used a high-density protein microarray approach to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni, a bacterium that causes leptospirosis, a widespread zoonotic disease. The study aimed to develop an efficient diagnostic test for leptospirosis, which lacks an adequate laboratory test, especially during the early stages of illness when antibiotic therapy is most effective. The researchers constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 2,421 proteins, representing 61% of the Leptospira interrogans proteome, and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including patients with acute and convalescent leptospirosis, as well as healthy controls from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis.

The study identified 16 antigens that can distinguish between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the identified antigens, such as LipL32 and GroEL, are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients, validating the serodiagnostic antigen discovery approach. The study also identified novel antigens, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. These novel antigens may have potential use in developing new tests and improving currently available assays for diagnosing leptospirosis, a neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
Researchers investigated the role of melanization, a key immune response in insects, in the defense of mosquitoes against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Using the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae as a model, they found that melanization is triggered against all stages of B. bassiana, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae. However, melanization rarely aborts the growth of the fungus, and the mycelium continues to grow despite being melanized. Silencing key regulators of melanization, TEP1 and CLIPA8, abolished melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. The study suggests that melanization of early fungal stages is a cell-mediated response, while late-stage melanization is a humoral response dependent on TEP1 and CLIPA8. Microscopic analysis revealed that TEP1 is associated with the surfaces of hyphae and that both TEP1 and CLIPA8 are required for recruiting phenoloxidase to these surfaces. Notably, fungal proliferation was more rapid in mosquitoes with silenced TEP1 and CLIPA8, which exhibited increased sensitivity to natural B. bassiana infections. These findings indicate that the mosquito melanization response significantly retards B. bassiana growth and dissemination, suggesting a potential target for designing transgenic fungi with enhanced bio-control activities against mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated the potential of four chemical compounds to prevent dengue virus infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. The compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), are known to inhibit dengue virus host factors (DENV HFs) in mammalian cells. The researchers tested these compounds using various methods, including injection, sugar feeding, and blood feeding, and found that BAF and MPA were effective in reducing dengue virus titers in the mosquito midgut and salivary gland. Specifically, injection of BAF and MPA prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited dengue virus titers by 56% and 60%, respectively, in the midgut, and by 90% and 83%, respectively, in the salivary gland. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene also reduced dengue virus infection, indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition likely occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs. The study suggests that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of vATPase and IMPDH can be used to suppress dengue virus infection in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which may lead to a reduction in dengue transmission.
Researchers have investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization in the brain. These pathological states are characterized by excessive neuronal depolarization and major ion rearrangements across the cell membrane. The study demonstrates that cell volume can act as a bifurcation parameter, influencing neuronal behavior in response to osmotic pressure-induced swelling. By incorporating cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics, the researchers showed that spontaneous transitions between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states occur as the cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. The study also revealed a dynamical definition for the physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. The findings highlight the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provide novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. The study suggests that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane, which can be understood by considering dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors, potentially leading to universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the immune response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a prevalent disease in Latin America. The study found that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to P. brasiliensis infection in murine dendritic cells, leading to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. This activation is dependent on several factors, including potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin B release. The researchers also demonstrated that IL-1β signaling plays a crucial role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. The study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis infection, and that IL-1β signaling is essential for host defense against this fungus. Further research is needed to determine the role of IL-1R1 and NLRP3 inflammasome components in protecting against P. brasiliensis infection in vivo and to understand how IL-1β activates macrophages for enhanced killing activity in vitro. The findings of this study provide new insights into the immune response to P. brasiliensis and highlight the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in host defense against fungal infections.
Toxoplasma gondii, a brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice, despite its ability to infect other cell types, such as astrocytes, in vitro. Researchers used a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model to track host cells that interact with the parasite, even if the interaction is transient. The study found that Toxoplasma shows a strong preference for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, regardless of the presence of interferon-γ, which stimulates astrocytes to clear intracellular parasites, or the use of parasites resistant to the major mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites. The findings suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather are the primary target cells for Toxoplasma in vivo. The study used Toxoplasma strains that inject Cre recombinase into host cells, allowing researchers to identify and track host cells that interact with the parasite. The results show that neurons consistently make up the majority of the cells that interact with Toxoplasma in the CNS, regardless of the time point or infecting strain. These findings have implications for understanding how Toxoplasma establishes a persistent brain infection, which affects up to 1/3 of the world's population. The study provides new insights into the host cell-pathogen dynamics of Toxoplasma infection and may lead to the development of therapies to eliminate this persistent pathogen.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain how cells move using a process called lamellipodial motility. This process involves the growth of a flat actin network wrapped in the cell's plasma membrane and the contraction of this network powered by myosin. The model accounts for the forces involved in this process, including isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion.

The model shows that the initiation of motility depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, representing myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When contractility is strong enough, cells break symmetry and move steadily along straight or circular trajectories. The model also predicts that the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary.

The researchers found that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in certain conditions, where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell. The model's predictions agree with experimental observations, including the aspect ratio of a steadily moving cell, which varies between 1 and 3. This study provides new insights into the mechanical mechanisms underlying cell motility and turning behavior.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, which are complex maps of how proteins interact with each other. PPI networks are crucial for understanding how cells function, but they are often noisy and incomplete due to experimental errors. For example, yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and a false negative rate of 43-71%. The new method, called geometric de-noising, uses a geometric graph model to assess the confidence levels of known interactions and predict new ones. It achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. The researchers applied this method to the human PPI network and predicted 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. They also validated a statistically significant portion of these predictions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. This method is the first to use a geometric graph model for PPI networks and does not require multiple PPI datasets or a priori information about individual proteins. It can be used to guide future biological experiments and improve the accuracy of PPI networks. The data and Matlab code implementing the method are freely available online.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism contributing to the development of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of CTG repeats in non-coding DNA. The study used a Drosophila (fruit fly) model to investigate the role of expanded CTG and CAG repeat transcripts in disease pathogenesis. The results show that co-expression of CTG and CAG repeat transcripts leads to dramatically enhanced toxicity in the flies. This toxicity is associated with the generation of small RNA molecules, known as siRNAs, which are derived from the triplet repeat expansions. These siRNAs target and suppress the expression of genes containing CAG repeats, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which are also affected in DM1. The findings suggest that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of human repeat expansion diseases where anti-sense transcription occurs. The study demonstrates that the Drosophila model recapitulates key features of DM1, including the formation of RNA accumulations in muscle nuclei and altered alternative splicing. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying DM1 and highlight the potential importance of anti-sense transcription in the development of repeat expansion diseases.
Researchers have revised the classification of a model soft rot phytopathogen, Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic analysis revealed that SCC3193 is more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae, rather than Pectobacterium carotovorum as previously thought. This reclassification indicates that Pectobacterium wasabiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, albeit unnoticed, for a long time. The study also identified novel virulence determinants of Pectobacterium wasabiae, including a putative transcriptional regulator, two type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters containing predicted virulence genes. These determinants contribute to the bacterium's ability to cause disease in plants. The absence of a type III secretion system, which is present in other soft rot bacteria, is a distinctive feature of Pectobacterium wasabiae. The study's findings provide a solid basis for further investigation into the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria, and may shed light on the poorly understood latent stage of infection in plants. The research also highlights the potential for horizontal gene transfer to contribute to the evolution of virulence in bacteria. Overall, the study provides new insights into the biology of Pectobacterium wasabiae and its role in causing soft rot disease in plants.
Researchers used a network analysis approach to study the changes in mitochondrial protein expression in cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial DNA depletion is associated with various human diseases, including aging and apoptosis. The study aimed to understand how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) change in response to dysfunctional mitochondrial states. By analyzing gene expression data, the researchers identified two predominant subnetworks of up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in mtDNA-depleted mitochondria. The down-regulated proteins were involved in typical mitochondrial functions, such as energy production and protein folding, while the up-regulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. The study found that cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression and transport of mt proteins. This suggests that the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks is remodeled in response to dysfunctional cellular states. The results provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions and may have implications for understanding the biological implications of mt regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional mt states. The study also highlights the importance of systematic data-integrative analysis in evaluating the reliability of proteomics data and identifying functional modules of mitochondrial proteins.
Researchers have developed a new method to determine the rates of complex biological processes, such as protein synthesis, that occur within living cells. These processes involve multiple steps, including molecular association and dissociation, chemical reactions, and mechanical movements, which can be difficult to measure directly in living cells. The new method, called kinetic distance, allows scientists to compare the rates of these processes in a laboratory setting (in vitro) to those that occur within living cells (in vivo). The kinetic distance is a quantitative measure that depends on the transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of the underlying free energy barriers. By minimizing the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo processes, the method can predict the in-vivo rates of protein synthesis. The researchers applied this method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression, and found good agreement between their predictions and experimental data. The predicted in-vivo rates led to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, primarily due to an improved initial selection of transfer RNA (tRNA). This method can be applied to any biomolecular process for which detailed information about the in-vitro kinetics is available.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, over short and long periods of time. They analyzed DNA sequences from 97 isolates of the bacteria, including 34 pairs of sequential samples from the same host and 29 isolates from 10 families. The study found that the accumulation of genetic diversity in the bacteria increased over time in a predictable manner, similar to a clock.

The researchers estimated the rate of genetic mutations and recombination in the bacteria. They found that the short-term mutation rate was between 1.4×10−6 and 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with recombination introducing three times as many genetic changes as mutations. The study also found that the long-term mutation rate over thousands of years was 5-17 times lower due to the removal of harmful mutations through natural selection.

The researchers compared their findings to previous estimates of mutation rates in other bacteria and found that the rates can vary greatly between species, spanning several orders of magnitude. They also found that the mutation rate in Helicobacter pylori is lower than previously estimated using a universal molecular clock rate. The study's results provide new insights into the evolution of Helicobacter pylori and highlight the importance of considering short-term and long-term mutation rates in understanding bacterial evolution.
Researchers have found that melanopsin, a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in the thalamo-cortical visual system. These cells, known as mRGCs, are responsible for driving reflex light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. However, their contribution to conventional visual pathways had not been directly assessed until now. Using new reporter lines, the study reveals that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. In mice lacking rods and cones, a model of advanced retinal degeneration, mRGC input supports extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex. The study also shows that melanopsin input to the LGN supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of neurons. This suggests that melanopsin is required to accurately encode stimulus irradiance. The findings indicate that melanopsin-based photoreception is a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. The study identifies mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and suggests that they may support vision in people suffering from retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection leads to a significant depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. This study investigated whether the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals affects the humoral response to microbial and food antigens. The results show that HIV-1-infected individuals have reduced IgG responses to antigens from certain types of bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes. Additionally, intestinal secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) exhibit elevated levels of IgM and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to various microbial and food antigens. This suggests that mucosal B cells in HIV-1-infected individuals have reduced competence for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their ability to respond to changing antigens in the gut lumen. The decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study also found that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4+ T cell counts have reduced levels of plasma IgG specific to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and that viral controllers have decreased levels of IgG specific to most mucosal antigens compared to ART-treated and untreated subjects.
Researchers have developed a new model to study population dynamics in ecosystems where resources are limited. In these systems, the growth of one population must be balanced by the decline of others. Traditional models assume populations change gradually due to random births and deaths, but this new model introduces a new mechanism: sudden and severe reductions in population size, freeing up resources for other species. This mechanism is relevant to communities of bacteria, where strain-specific collapses can be caused by invading viruses, and other ecosystems where infectious diseases play a significant role.

The model shows that this mechanism leads to "diversity waves," where population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and then decreases exponentially. The distribution of species abundances is bimodal, with a lower peak formed by recently collapsed or newly introduced species and an upper peak formed by species that have not yet collapsed. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory that is transmitted across multiple waves, resulting in a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution.

The model is robust to variations in its rules, including diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies. Simulations of the model preserve the general patterns of collapse-driven dynamics, including diversity waves and a broad time-aggregated distribution of population sizes with a scale-free tail. The long-term growth rate of each species is zero, making the classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term exponential growth rate inappropriate for this model.
Researchers have re-examined the chemotactic behavior of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria that navigates its environment by following chemical gradients. Chemotaxis is a crucial ability for bacteria, providing a significant competitive advantage and allowing them to adapt quickly to their environment. The current understanding of E. coli chemotaxis suggests that the bacteria detect concentration differences in their surroundings and adjust their flagellar motor rotation to move up the gradient. However, a new study proposes an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli. Using computer simulations, the researchers found that the degree of reorientation during a tumble, in addition to the probability of tumbling, depends on the swimming direction along the gradient. This fine-tuning of tumbling angle results in a significant enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient. The study suggests that this additional mechanism arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and is likely used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria with similar chemotaxis behavior. The researchers used a hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli to investigate the dependence of tumbling angle on the number of switching motors and found that even a small difference in tumbling angles up and down the gradient can improve chemotactic efficiency. The study demonstrates a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis and highlights the complexity of bacterial navigation mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). These cells are essential for establishing central tolerance by presenting self-peptides to thymocytes, which helps to prevent autoimmune diseases. The study found that activation of the Stat3 pathway promotes the survival of immature mTEC precursors and is necessary for the proper formation of the medullary region in the thymus. In contrast, deleting Stat3 in mTECs disrupts the medullary region's architecture and reduces the number of mTECs.

The researchers used a constitutively active Stat3 transgene to increase mTEC cellularity and found that it bypassed the need for signals from positively selected thymocytes to drive medullary region formation. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 in mTECs reduced mTEC cellularity and impaired medullary region formation. The study also showed that Stat3 signaling does not affect mTEC proliferation, but rather promotes the survival of immature mTEC precursors.

These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals play an essential role in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis. The study's results suggest that Stat3 activation is necessary for optimal development and maintenance of the thymic medullary compartment, and that disrupting Stat3 signaling can have significant consequences for the immune system.
Researchers have identified a large number of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile. These sRNAs play a crucial role in the bacterium's physiology and pathogenesis. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, the researchers identified 511 sRNA candidates in both intergenic and coding regions of the C. difficile genome. Of these, 251 were confirmed to be putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans-riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches.

The researchers used RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq to study the expression of these sRNAs under different growth conditions, including exponential growth phase, stationary phase, and starvation. They found that some sRNAs showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles, and 16 predicted c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches were experimentally confirmed to regulate motility and biofilm formation. Additionally, the researchers detected abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, which may be important for the bacterium's survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities.

This study provides the first experimental genome-wide identification of C. difficile sRNAs and sets the stage for future research on the molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen. The discovery of novel sRNAs in C. difficile highlights the potential diversity of RNA-based mechanisms controlling key steps in the infection cycle of this bacterium.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of microRNA-122 (miR-122), a liver-specific microRNA essential for liver development and metabolism. Research has shown that the HCV core protein downregulates miR-122 by inhibiting the activity of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. This inhibition leads to the destabilization of miR-122, resulting in the dysregulation of its known functions, including its proviral activity for HCV.

Studies using high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies revealed that the 22-nucleotide prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to the 22-nt prototype miR-122.

The HCV core protein specifically inhibits GLD-2, a terminal nucleotidyl transferase that catalyzes the 3'-terminal extension of miR-122. This interaction between the HCV core protein and GLD-2 is responsible for the downregulation of miR-122. The study also found that the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Overall, the research provides new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.
Researchers have found evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in wild African lions in the Serengeti. Trypanosomes are parasites that cause disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. The study suggests that lions develop immunity to Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes human sleeping sickness, after being exposed to other species of trypanosomes. This immunity is thought to be driven by an increase in cross-immunity following infections with Trypanosoma congolense, a more genetically diverse species. As a result, lions are able to clear most infections of T. brucei by 3-5 years of age and eliminate all infections of T. brucei rhodesiense, the subspecies that causes human sleeping sickness, by 6 years of age. This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species. The findings suggest that frequent re-exposure to trypanosomes through tsetse bites accelerates the onset and extent of immunity. The study's results have significant implications for the development of vaccines against trypanosomiasis, as they challenge the long-held assumption that immunity to trypanosomes is impossible. The discovery of acquired immunity in lions may provide a new perspective on existing data and future research in this field, particularly in regions where trypanosomiasis is a significant public health concern, such as East Uganda where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection.
Researchers used a mathematical model of the human coagulation cascade to identify points of fragility, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets from two different in vitro coagulation models. The model accurately simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. These findings are consistent with current therapeutic strategies, as anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants. For example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The results support the idea that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. Further research is needed to refine the model and explore the robustness of fIX mechanisms using in vivo animal models or cell-based assays.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and their host bacteria, Campylobacter jejuni, in a laboratory setting. They used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to understand the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions, which is crucial for the successful application of phage therapy. Phage therapy involves using bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic bacteria.

The study found that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arose readily in the in vitro system. The researchers tested a simple model of phage-bacteria interactions against in vitro data and found that it fit the data surprisingly well. They also confirmed that the inundation and proliferation thresholds, which are critical parameters in phage therapy, are likely to be of practical importance.

The study used a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to estimate the thresholds and rate constants of phage-bacteria interactions. The results showed density-dependent features of phage infectivity that warrant further investigation. The study highlights the importance of combining empirical studies with kinetic models to gain a deeper understanding of phage therapy. The findings suggest that in vitro studies are essential for building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy.

The researchers emphasize the need for a theoretical framework to understand the non-linear kinetic properties of phages as "self-replicating pharmaceuticals." They argue that testing models of in vitro phage therapy is a necessary step in understanding how PK/PD theory can be applied in clinical and other in vivo settings.
Researchers have identified a novel Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomiasis, caused by S. mansoni, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The snail's immune response is essential for protecting against schistosome infection, but few specific snail immune factors have been identified and functionally characterized. This study provides the first functional report of a snail TLR, named BgTLR, which is involved in the cellular immune response of B. glabrata following challenge with S. mansoni. The researchers found that the S. mansoni-resistant strain of B. glabrata (BS-90) displayed higher levels of BgTLR compared to the susceptible (M-line) strain. Transcript expression of BgTLR was significantly increased in BS-90 snails when challenged with S. mansoni, whereas expression in susceptible M-line snails was not significantly increased. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails via targeted siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails. These findings demonstrate that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that influences infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge. The discovery of BgTLR provides new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between schistosomes and their snail hosts, which could be exploited in disease prevention and control efforts.
Researchers have developed a new tool to assess human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes in the Pacific region. Aedes mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, transmit diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. Current methods for measuring exposure to these mosquitoes are limited, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs. To address this issue, scientists created an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect antibodies in human blood that are directed against proteins found in the saliva of Aedes mosquitoes. The test was conducted on human populations in Tahiti and Moorea, where both mosquito species are present, and metropolitan France, where they are not. The results showed that 98% of individuals in Tahiti and 68% in Moorea had developed antibodies against the saliva of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, respectively. In contrast, only 3% of individuals in metropolitan France had antibodies against the saliva of either mosquito species. The study found no cross-reactivity between the two mosquito species, indicating that the antibody response is specific to each species. This new tool can help identify areas with high disease transmission risk and evaluate the effectiveness of vector control strategies in the Pacific region and other tropical areas.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a highly successful pathogen that adapts to the intracellular environment of human macrophages to cause disease. Research has shown that Mtb's ability to regulate the metabolic machinery of the host cell is a key factor in its pathogenicity. A study investigated how Mtb infection influences the metabolic pathways of the host macrophage by examining the temporal effects of infection with mycobacterial strains of varying virulence. The results confirmed that Mtb's pathogenicity is linked to its ability to regulate host cell metabolism, and that this process is controlled at the level of host cell metabolism. The study identified a subset of host reactions that are targeted by Mtb, which facilitates both macrophage survival and mycobacterial sustenance. The findings suggest that the glycemic status of an individual also impacts the innate defense mechanism that controls Mtb infection, and that circulating glucose levels contribute to pathogenicity by influencing macrophage apoptosis. The study highlights the importance of metabolic intervention in dictating the pathology of tuberculosis, and suggests that existing paradigms for understanding Mtb pathogenicity may need to be revisited. The research provides new insights into the complex relationship between host and pathogen, and has implications for the development of effective treatments and vaccines against TB.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZHP-3 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the process of meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination is essential for ensuring the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. ZHP-3 is the C. elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, which is also involved in meiotic recombination. The study found that ZHP-3 protein localization is highly dynamic, shifting from along the length of the synaptonemal complex (SC) to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events.

The researchers created a ZHP-3::GFP transgene, which partially complements a null mutation and reveals a separation of function. While the fusion protein can promote nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is also perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers.

The study also found that the SUMO pathway is involved in the process of SC disassembly and bivalent differentiation. The researchers propose that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic recombination and the role of ZHP-3 in this process.
Aedes albopictus, a tropical mosquito species, has spread to temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit arboviruses and cause nuisance problems. Researchers investigated the effects of eco-climatic factors on the abundance and dynamics of Ae. albopictus in metropolitan and suburban/rural areas in Rome, Italy, which is one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. A 70 km-long transect was monitored for 18 weeks, and two fine-scale spatiotemporal datasets were analyzed to examine the impact of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance.

Results showed that highly anthropized habitats were associated with high adult abundance in both metropolitan and suburban/rural areas, with "small green islands" corresponding to hotspots of abundance in metropolitan areas. A bimodal seasonal dynamics was observed, with a second peak of abundance in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. In contrast, an increase in vegetation cover was negatively associated with mosquito abundance. The study highlights the importance of prioritizing public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas, where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are higher. The findings also suggest that public health risks persist beyond the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.
Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), play a crucial role in the early stages of infection by facilitating the bacterium's invasion of host macrophages. Research has shown that DIM are essential for the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. Studies using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis demonstrated that DIM induce changes in the organization of the host cell's plasma membrane lipids. Specifically, DIM alter the fluidity and polarity of the membrane's hydrophobic core, making it more conducive to phagocytosis. This effect is dependent on the presence of cholesterol in the host cell membrane, as depleting cholesterol with drugs abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification observed between wild-type and mutant strains. The researchers propose that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by targeting lipid organization in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. This modification favors the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contributes to the control of phagosomal pH, allowing the bacterium to establish a protective niche within the host cell.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the behavior of small neural networks, which are composed of a few tens of neurons. Traditional mean-field approximations are not effective in describing the dynamics of these networks, leading to significant differences between the predicted and actual behavior. To address this limitation, the researchers created a systematic analysis of the dynamics of small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. They used an approach that is largely analytically tractable to study the local bifurcations of neural activity and numerically determined the global bifurcations. The results show that strong inhibition in these networks leads to complex dynamics, characterized by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations. This phenomenon, known as spontaneous symmetry-breaking, is a finite-size effect that reveals qualitative differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The researchers found that this effect allows mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reduce the detrimental effects of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The study provides new insights into the dynamics of small neural networks and highlights the importance of considering finite-size effects in understanding neural behavior.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites, such as blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, of patients with dermal leishmaniasis. They used a specific RNA target, Leishmania 7SLRNA, to determine parasite viability and burden in these sites. The study found that viable Leishmania parasites were present in extralesional tissues, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, in 100% of patients with dermal leishmaniasis who tested positive for Leishmania DNA in these tissues. The researchers also detected Leishmania 7SLRNA transcripts in 68% of monocyte samples, 42% of tonsil swabs, and 36% of normal skin aspirates.

The study demonstrated that the number of 7SLRNA transcripts correlated with the number of viable Leishmania parasites, indicating that this target can be used to diagnose the presence of live parasites in extralesional tissues. This is significant because it allows for a parasitological diagnosis to be achieved, which is essential for determining the status of infection, monitoring treatment, and understanding the natural history of human infection. The researchers conclude that Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis. The findings of this study provide new insights into the dissemination of Leishmania parasites during active dermal leishmaniasis and highlight the importance of investigating the presence of Leishmania in extralesional tissues.
Researchers used a comprehensive dataset of chromatin features in Drosophila cells to develop a model that accurately predicts DNA replication timing. They found that combinations of histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) are key to achieving accurate predictions, suggesting that HMs may act combinatorially to regulate DNA replication timing. The model was trained on a set of 95 chromatin features, including 30 HMs and 65 CBPs, and was able to predict replication timing across the Drosophila S2 genome with high accuracy. Pairwise interactions between HMs were found to be particularly important for accurate predictions, and the addition of CBPs further improved the model's performance. A simplified version of the model, using only six key features, was able to achieve 80% of the full model's accuracy. The researchers also found that combinations of HMs can predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. This study provides evidence for the existence of combinatorial HM patterns in regulating DNA replication timing and identifies key elements that may contribute to this process. The findings have implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of DNA replication in metazoans.
Researchers investigated the spread of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil using genetic and epidemiological data. They found that new lineages of these serotypes were introduced to the country approximately every 7 to 10 years. The introduction of new lineages was most likely to occur from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and then disperse at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. The study suggests that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determines the spread of dengue virus in Brazil.

The researchers analyzed 178 Brazilian genome sequences and used a statistical framework to estimate the factors underlying dengue virus dispersal on a countrywide scale. They found that air traffic data was a significant predictor of viral spread, while Aedes aegypti infestation rates and geographical distances were not. The study also found that the introduction of new lineages was followed by epizootic amplifications in 7 to 10 year cycles, and that periodic dengue serotype-specific peaks in incidence coincide with the introduction of new lineages in Brazil.

The results of the study concur with epidemiological data, indicating that the introduction of new lineages is a key driver of dengue virus spread in Brazil. However, the researchers caution that predictions about viral emergence should be made with caution, as new lineages can be introduced to the country through chance importation events, as seen with the recent introduction of dengue serotype 4 genotype I from Southeast Asia.
Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain encodes sensory information, a problem known as the neural code. A key aspect of this code is the correlation between the activities of individual neurons, which is influenced by the structure of their receptive fields (RFs). In weakly electric fish, researchers investigated how differences in RF organization across three parallel sensory maps affect correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap, the researchers predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that the neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this result, the researchers incorporated the effects of RF surround in their model and found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. This suggests that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations. The study's findings have important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity. By systematically varying the size and gain of the RF surround, the researchers found that different combinations of RF center-surround balance gave rise to nearly identical correlations between pyramidal neuron activities. The sign and magnitude of correlations were largely determined by the relative strength of positively and negatively correlated inputs.
Researchers investigated how noise correlations between sensory neurons impact the population's ability to encode a stimulus. They considered a general setting for population coding, where neural tuning curves, variances, and other aspects were held fixed. The study yielded unifying insights into the role of noise correlations, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples.

The researchers generalized previous results to prove the sign rule (SR), which states that if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs compared to their signal correlations, coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity.

However, the SR does not provide a necessary condition for good coding. The study showed that a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding, many of which violate the SR and are consistent with experimentally observed correlations. The optimal correlation structures must lie on the boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations.

The researchers also provided a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which coding performance will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all. These conditions are satisfied with high probability for large populations, and the set of such correlation matrices is very high-dimensional.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics. They found that P. aeruginosa can alter the effectiveness of antibiotics against S. aureus in a complex and variable way, depending on the specific strain of P. aeruginosa. The study identified three key factors produced by P. aeruginosa that can either enhance or reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics against S. aureus: LasA endopeptidase, rhamnolipids, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). LasA endopeptidase was found to enhance the effectiveness of vancomycin, a commonly used antibiotic, by breaking down the cell walls of S. aureus. Rhamnolipids, on the other hand, facilitate the uptake of tobramycin, another antibiotic, into S. aureus cells. HQNO, however, induces tolerance to multiple antibiotics in S. aureus by inhibiting respiration and depleting cellular energy. The study also found that the production of these factors varies between different clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and correlates with their ability to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that the presence of a LasA-producing P. aeruginosa population can enhance the effectiveness of vancomycin treatment in a mouse model of S. aureus infection. These findings highlight the importance of considering the interactions between different microorganisms in the infection environment when treating polymicrobial infections.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection and found that excessive binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to platelets is a novel mechanism of platelet clearance. In two observational cohort studies in Indonesia, patients with DENV infection had higher plasma concentrations of VWF antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in DENV patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. The researchers found that the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. The study suggests that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in DENV infection results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. The findings indicate that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in the human genome, known as bidirectional promoters, which are associated with genes involved in DNA repair and cancer development. A bidirectional promoter is a region of DNA where two adjacent genes, directed away from each other, share a common regulatory element. This study used a comprehensive database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to map the most complete collection of human transcripts controlled by bidirectional promoters. The analysis revealed a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including breast and ovarian cancers.

Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, the researchers verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. They found that subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved sites in genes such as ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. This suggests that bidirectional promoters may regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes, including those involved in cancer.

The study also found that a subset of bidirectional promoters, which regulate genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers, contain common transcription factor binding sites. This raises the possibility that misregulation of these promoters could contribute to cancer development. The researchers propose that regulatory disruptions at bidirectional promoters could play a pivotal role in cancer, particularly if they contain common transcription factor binding sites.
A new study has revealed a surprising diversity of sex chromosome configurations in Diptera, the order of flies that includes mosquitoes, flies, and midges. Researchers analyzed the genomes of 37 fly species from 22 different families and found over a dozen different sex chromosome arrangements. While most flies have XY sex chromosomes, some species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others have a different chromosome serving as the sex chromosome, and a few have up to three chromosomal elements incorporated into the sex chromosomes. Additionally, some species have female heterogamety, where the sex chromosomes are ZW instead of XY.

Transcriptome analysis showed that dosage compensation, a mechanism that ensures equal gene expression between males and females, has evolved multiple times in flies. However, X chromosomes tend to have fewer genes with male-biased expression, suggesting that sex-specific selective pressures have shaped the evolution of sex chromosomes.

The study suggests that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times during the evolution of Diptera. The researchers propose that the small dot chromosome, which is a common feature of fly karyotypes, may have been the ancestral sex chromosome in some groups, while in others it may have been lost or replaced. The study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of sex chromosome evolution in flies and provides a rich resource for further research into the biology of sex chromosomes.
A study investigated the link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly in babies born in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. Researchers analyzed blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies. The samples were tested for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies. One mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody, and three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody. The study found a trend towards significance between ZIKV infection and microcephaly. Mothers who tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than those who were negative for the antibody, with an odds ratio of 11.0. Similarly, mothers who tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly, with an odds ratio of 6.8. The study suggests that ZIKV infection may be associated with microcephaly in babies born in the United States as early as 2009. The findings provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly.
Researchers conducted a study in the Ashanti region of Ghana to investigate the source of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections, which cause Buruli ulcer (BU). Although previous studies have linked MU infections to slow-moving water bodies, the exact mode of transmission remains unclear. The study used Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM) and to identify the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU-endemic communities, and VNTR profiles were compared to those from 14 confirmed BU patients in the same area.

The study found that MU was present in three types of water bodies, with significantly higher levels in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes (W, X, Y, and Z) were typed in both human and environmental samples, while other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified a mouse with a lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as an MU infection. The findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies, and that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. The study's results indicate that M. ulcerans transmission may involve multiple routes, including contact with risk environments and water bodies that act as vehicles for disseminating strains.
Researchers analyzed a comprehensive database of 27,723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide to understand the global distribution and drivers of alien bird species richness. They found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven by European (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introductions involve more species and countries, driven in part by increasing economic activity. The study demonstrated that alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, particularly the number of species introduced, known as "colonisation pressure." Environmental drivers also play a significant role, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated.

The researchers used a combination of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of alien species richness worldwide. They found that global patterns of alien species richness in birds are influenced by both human and biotic factors. The study also showed that regions with high alien species richness tend to be located in temperate regions at midlatitudes, where former British colonies, rapidly developing countries, and countries with high per capita GDP are located, and where colonisation pressure has been high. The results highlight the importance of colonisation pressure in understanding alien species richness and suggest that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, emphasizing the ongoing threats to global environments from species introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Research has shown that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage and is necessary for the transcription of rRNA genes in cell cultures. Deletion of UBF leads to a loss of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex, and results in the recruitment of H3K9me3, canonical histone H1, and HP1α to the rRNA gene loci. However, this does not lead to heterochromatinization, and the genes retain penta-acetyl H4 and H2A.Z, suggesting a potentially active state.

The loss of UBF also leads to the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and early embryos. This somatic NPB contains rRNA synthesis and processing factors but does not associate with the rRNA gene loci. Unexpectedly, the loss of UBF does not suppress the transcription of 5S, tRNA, or snRNA genes, nor the expression of several hundred mRNA genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis. This suggests that rRNA gene activity does not coordinate global gene expression for ribosome biogenesis. The study demonstrates that UBF is essential for the recruitment of SL1 to the rRNA promoter in vivo and plays a fundamental role in determining rRNA gene activity.
Researchers have re-examined the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in tissue patterning, specifically in the adult Drosophila intestine. Contrary to the conventional understanding that Wingless secretion and movement are essential for long-range signaling, the study found that a membrane-tethered form of Wingless produced viable adults with largely normal external morphology. This suggests that Wingless secretion and movement may not be necessary for tissue patterning. However, further investigation revealed that the critical roles of Wingless in adult intestinal development, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway, are disrupted when Wingless is tethered to the membrane. These findings indicate that the direct, long-range action of Wingless is essential for tissue patterning in the adult intestine. The study provides new evidence supporting the requirement for long-range action of Wingless in tissue patterning, with implications for animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The research also highlights the importance of understanding the contexts in which the long-range action of Wnt is essential, and may have relevance for the mammalian intestine, which is similarly divided into distinct compartments and dependent on Wnt expression for regionalization.
Researchers have identified a key role for the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in the development of invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. GAS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its ability to accumulate plasmin at the cell surface is crucial for invasive disease initiation. The study found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. The study also found that GAS can mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease, a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/− mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system (T4SS) components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface. The cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) encodes components of the T4SS that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, CagI, and CagH are specialized components of the cag T4SS that bind the host receptor α5β1 integrin and are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI. These proteins are detectable on the bacterial surface and are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells.

Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. Mutant strains lacking CagI and CagL fail to form pili, while a mutant strain lacking CagH exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype with elongated and thickened pili. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL, and deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction. The C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili. These results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, highlighting the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS.
Researchers conducted a global gene transcriptome analysis in vaccinated cattle to identify potential biomarkers for protection against bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. The study aimed to identify host correlates of protection to aid in the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB. Calves were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol, and their protective efficacy was determined after Mycobacterium bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle, and global gene expression was determined by RNA sequencing. The analysis revealed 668 genes that were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared to vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. The most significant pathway related to this dataset was cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, with interleukin-22 (IL-22) expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection, alongside interferon-gamma (INF-γ). The importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy was further confirmed by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. These findings suggest that IL-22 plays a crucial role in protection against bTB and may serve as a potential biomarker for vaccine efficacy.
Researchers have discovered distinct populations of microtubules at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) in differentiated cells. These ncMTOCs, found in most cells, regulate microtubule organization and dynamics, but their function is not well understood. The study used a tissue-specific degradation system to investigate the role of essential centrosomal microtubule nucleators γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora A at the apical ncMTOC in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. The results show that γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are required to recruit other γ-TuRC components to the centrosome, but not to the apical ncMTOC. However, microtubules remain organized at the apical ncMTOC even when γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are depleted, suggesting that different microtubule organizing centers use discrete proteins for their function. The study found that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources. The findings suggest that the localization of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 to the apical ncMTOC may serve to remove them from the centrosome at the end of mitosis, as centrosomal MTOC function is attenuated.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which involves determining the parental origin of genetic variants in an individual's DNA. Most human sequencing initiatives do not phase the genome, as it is a complex and costly process. The study used the "Genome-In-A-Bottle" (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of the 11 approaches. The methods included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing and computational approaches that reconstruct phase information from sequencing reads and population-level haplotype frequency information.

The study found that a hybrid approach that combines population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. The inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. The study also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which include regions of low polymorphism or single nucleotide variant (SNV) density. The results suggest that hybrid computational approaches to phasing a single genome are accurate and cost-effective, and exhibit a performance that nearly matches or surpasses laboratory-based approaches.
Researchers have investigated the process of type-III protein secretion in Salmonella enterica, a gram-negative pathogen. This process involves the secretion of building blocks of the bacterial flagellum, virulence effectors into host cells, and structural subunits of the needle complex. The flagellar type-III secretion apparatus typically utilizes both the energy of the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. However, a study has found that functional flagella can form in the absence of type-III ATPase activity. This was achieved through mutations that increased the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels. The study also showed that increased proton motive force can bypass the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. The findings suggest that type-III ATPases play a role in enhancing secretion efficiency under limited secretion substrate concentrations, but are not essential for the type-III protein export process. In fact, the results demonstrate that ATPase activity is universally dispensable for protein export via bacterial type-III secretion systems. The study proposes that the function of the T3SS-associated ATPase complex is to deliver secretion substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding. The findings have important implications for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and type-III secretion systems.
Researchers have investigated the emergence of switch-like behavior in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which control essential biological functions such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. They used chemical reaction network theory to analyze over 40,000 simple GRNs consisting of two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. The study found that approximately 90% of these networks can exhibit bistability, which is the ability to switch between two stable states, for certain sets of reaction rate constants. This is a significant finding, as bistability is often associated with complex network topologies, but the researchers identified bistable networks that do not contain the typical features of bistable systems.

The study also identified 11 minimal bistable networks, which are networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks and are rendered monostable by the removal of one or more reactions. This suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through network evolution. The researchers applied their approach to publicly available data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. The study highlights the potential of chemical reaction network theory to systematically identify bistable network topologies in real biological systems. The findings provide powerful hypotheses for further experimentation and can be used to provide guidance or functional context to any system for which interaction data is available.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, were found to be responsible for the condition. Hyaluronidase 2 breaks down hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Studies showed that mutations in the HYAL2 gene lead to reduced levels of the enzyme, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate in mice. In humans, affected individuals exhibited orofacial clefting, craniofacial dysmorphism, and in some cases, cor triatriatum sinister, a rare heart defect. Cor triatriatum sinister was also observed in a proportion of mice lacking the Hyal2 gene. The study highlights the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes in human and mouse development and identifies a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister. The findings suggest that a deficiency of the HA-degrading enzyme HYAL2 is a novel cause of syndromic orofacial clefting in humans and submucosal cleft palate in mice, and provide the first molecular explanation for cor triatriatum sinister in humans.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism for the regeneration of mechanosensory tip links in auditory hair cells, which are crucial for sound detection in the inner ear. These tip links, composed of proteins protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), connect stereocilia and convey force to transduction channels. Current models suggest a static composition of the tip link, with PCDH15 at the lower end and CDH23 at the upper end. However, a new study has found that functional tip links have at least two molecular compositions: PCDH15/CDH23 and PCDH15/PCDH15.

During regeneration, shorter tip links containing equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first, followed by the re-establishment of the mature PCDH15/CDH23 composition. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that these transient PCDH15/PCDH15 links mediate mechanotransduction currents, but with abnormal calcium-dependent decay. The study used a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize the tip links and their components. The findings provide a molecular mechanism for the regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells. This discovery could help identify the elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery. The study also suggests that the two-step molecular remodeling process may underlie the formation of tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation.
Researchers conducted a study to better understand the progression of dengue fever to its more severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). They analyzed the serum metabolome of adult patients with dengue fever (DF) and DHF at the critical and recovery phases of infection. The study found 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF patients at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were significantly higher in DHF patients, suggesting liver injury, while uric acid, a key antioxidant, was lower in DHF patients, potentially leading to increased oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained altered in DHF patients, indicating a prolonged impact on the liver. The study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF and provided insights into the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis. These findings may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for dengue management.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan that causes African trypanosomiasis. GMPR plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of purine nucleotides within the cell by converting guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). The study found that the GMPR enzyme in T. brucei is distinct from its host animals, with a unique insertion of a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain. This domain is not found in mammalian or bacterial GMPRs. The researchers also discovered that the T. brucei GMPR enzyme is activated by the presence of monovalent cations such as potassium (K+) and ammonium (NH4+), whereas mammalian GMPRs are not affected by these cations. Additionally, the study found that the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibits the activity of T. brucei GMPR, but has little to no effect on mammalian GMPRs. These findings suggest that the GMPR enzyme in T. brucei has a distinct mechanism of action compared to its host animals. The study also demonstrated that ribavirin can inhibit the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to study how two drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, interact with a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel called NavAb. Sodium channels play a crucial role in controlling electrical excitability in cells, and blocking them can be used to treat conditions such as epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. To develop more targeted treatments, scientists need a better understanding of how current channel blockers work.

The study used the recently determined crystal structure of NavAb to simulate how benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the protein and enter the channel. The results show that both drugs have two likely binding sites in the pore, characterized by non-specific, hydrophobic interactions. One site is located just above the activation gate, and the other is at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations.

The simulations suggest that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, supporting the idea of a hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. The study highlights the importance of specific residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration, and in forming the drug binding sites. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of sodium channel inhibitors and could inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments for conditions such as epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in specific cell types during intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodentium. MyD88 is a key mediator of the immune response, and its deficiency has been linked to increased susceptibility to various bacterial infections. To understand the cell type-specific contribution of MyD88, the researchers used a novel mouse model that allows for the reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in MyD88-deficient mice.

The study found that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) was sufficient to activate the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response and the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to C. rodentium infection. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to other cell types, such as macrophages, T cells, or ILC3, did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses. However, the study also showed that MyD88 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) partially protected mice during intestinal infection, associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins.

These findings suggest that MyD88 signaling in DCs and IECs is essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium. The study highlights the critical role of MyD88 in both innate and adaptive immunity in the intestine and provides new insights into the mechanisms of intestinal immunity.
Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerciasis volvulus, is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To determine whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop, an immunodiagnostic test detecting human IgG4 antibodies to the Onchocerciasis volvulus-specific antigen Ov16 is used. Mathematical modeling was used to explore the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the duration and coverage of MDA, microfilaria (mf) prevalence in the population, and the probability of onchocerciasis elimination. The ONCHOSIM model was extended to include Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals. The study found that yearly repeated MDA leads to a strong reduction in parasite acquisition rate in humans, reducing seroconversion rates in newborns and young children. Both mf prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics. The study demonstrates that the endpoint for stopping MDA will be dependent on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA.
Researchers investigated how prions, misfolded proteins that can cause disease, adapt to their environment and develop resistance to drugs. They found that when prions were grown in the presence of an inhibitory drug, swainsonine, some prions became resistant to the drug, while others became dependent on it for growth. This means that in the presence of the drug, these prions grew more rapidly than their drug-sensitive counterparts. The researchers were able to isolate and propagate these drug-dependent prions indefinitely, even in the absence of the drug. They found that the misfolded prion protein associated with the drug-dependent variant was less rapidly cleared from cells than its drug-sensitive counterpart, suggesting that structural differences in the misfolded protein underlie the properties of the prions. The study suggests that prions can adapt to their environment through conformational changes, leading to the selection of drug-resistant or drug-dependent variants. This has implications for the development of treatments for prion diseases, as it highlights the potential for prions to develop resistance to therapeutic agents. The researchers propose that prion populations are quasi-species, comprising a range of variants with different properties, from which the fittest are selected in a particular environment. This study provides new insights into the complex behavior of prions and the mechanisms by which they adapt to their environment.
Researchers analyzed a vast space of 1015 possible central carbon metabolisms to understand the potential for metabolic innovation. They used a method called flux balance analysis to predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. The study found that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype make up a small fraction of the genotype space, but their absolute numbers are substantial, exceeding 10^9 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with the same phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that spans a significant portion of the metabolic genotype space, allowing for the possibility of reaching novel phenotypes through a series of single reaction changes. The study also found that the minimal distance between genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, suggesting that metabolisms with novel phenotypes can be reached through one or few genotypic changes. However, exceptions to these principles exist for metabolisms with complexity close to the minimum needed for viability. The study's findings suggest that increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and innovation. Additionally, the researchers found that the neighborhoods of metabolisms viable on the same carbon source can contain different novel phenotypes, and the accessibility of these phenotypes may depend on the location of the metabolism in the genotype space.
Researchers analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex, a group of insects that can transmit the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. The study focused on the complex's population genetics at different geographic scales, from local to regional, across the Mexican Neotropics. Two fragments of the ND4 gene were analyzed to understand the genetic diversity of the complex.

The results showed that the lowest genetic diversity of T. dimidiata was found in areas with high levels of human modification, where T. cruzi infection prevalence was also highest. The study found significant differences in T. cruzi infection prevalence among the three main haplogroups of T. dimidiata, with haplogroups 1 and 3 having higher infection rates than expected, while haplogroup 2 had lower rates. Additionally, the study found differences in the frequency of Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) of T. cruzi among the haplogroups.

The researchers estimated that the T. dimidiata complex diverged from its most recent common ancestor around 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with primary divergence of haplogroups 2 and 3. The study also found that the effective population size of Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased around 0.02-0.03 million years ago. The results support previous ecological niche evidence for the complex's origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus and suggest that the three main haplogroups of T. dimidiata have differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, which are important components of vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors play a significant role in the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, primarily through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. A 10-year field surveillance study in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot in Hunan Province, analyzed the relationships between environmental factors, rodent species, and HFRS occurrence. The study included 709 cases of HFRS and found that different rodent species were associated with transmission risks in various land types. Rattus norvegicus and R. flavipectus were linked to HFRS risk in grassland, while Mus musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also influenced by environmental variability. A predictive risk model based on significant factors showed that cultivated land represented the highest risk for HFRS incidence, consistent with 2014-2015 statistics. The study suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease is influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. The findings highlight the importance of preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments.
Researchers have found that the efficiency of splicing in the HRAS gene can determine the phenotype and frequency of Costello syndrome (CS) and cancer. Costello syndrome is a congenital disease caused by mutations in the HRAS gene, and it is characterized by growth retardation, tumor predisposition, and developmental delay. The majority of CS cases are caused by a specific mutation, c.34G>A, which has a modest negative effect on exon 2 inclusion. However, a new germline mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, was identified in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of the HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping, which was confirmed using wild-type and mutant HRAS minigenes.

The researchers found that the c.35_36GC>TG mutation disrupts the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creates an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), leading to exon 2 skipping. This vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is caused by a weak 3' splice site, making exon 2 inclusion dependent on the binding of splicing stimulatory proteins, such as SRSF2. The researchers also found that the majority of cancer- and CS-causing mutations are located in this region and affect splicing differently.

The study suggests that the phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. Furthermore, the researchers developed a splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE, causing exon 2 skipping and halting the proliferation of cancer cells. This finding opens up a potential for the development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.
Researchers have found that a specific type of RNA modification called N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebellum, a region of the brain involved in motor control and coordination. This modification is catalyzed by a protein called methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), which is part of a complex that adds the methyl group to the RNA molecule. In a study using mice, researchers found that inactivating METTL3 in the nervous system led to severe developmental defects in the brain, including a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia, where the cerebellum is underdeveloped. This was caused by the premature death of a type of cell called cerebellar granule cells, which are essential for the proper development of the cerebellum.

The researchers found that the loss of m6A caused by METTL3 inactivation led to changes in the stability and splicing of specific genes involved in cerebellar development and cell death. This resulted in the dysregulation of gene expression and the premature death of cerebellar granule cells. The study suggests that METTL3-mediated m6A is essential for regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum and that its dysregulation can lead to severe developmental defects. The findings provide new insights into the role of m6A in the development of the central nervous system and highlight the importance of METTL3 in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription factors in regulating gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These cells have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the developing embryo. The transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are essential for maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells. The study found that the combination of these transcription factors binding to specific DNA sequences, known as combinatorial binding, is strongly associated with the presence of the Mediator complex, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes. This suggests that combinatorial binding plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in ES cells.

The study also compared the binding patterns of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in human and mouse ES cells. While individual binding events were found to be species-specific, combinatorial binding events were more conserved between the two species. Specifically, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development were shared between human and mouse ES cells. This suggests that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. The study's findings provide further evidence for the tight connection between pluripotency and early development mediated by these transcription factors.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer characterized by genetic mutations that disrupt normal blood cell development. A specific chromosomal translocation, t(8;21), occurs in approximately 10-15% of AML cases, resulting in the formation of the AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor. This fusion protein interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by targeting AML1 binding sites on DNA.

Research has shown that AML1/ETO interacts with other transcription factors, including E-proteins such as HEB, to regulate gene expression. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation, revealing that the fusion protein co-localizes with AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. The DNA binding profile of HEB was significantly altered upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing the fusion protein.

These findings suggest that the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB plays a major role in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein. AML1 and HEB share a proportion of target genes in wild-type conditions, and when they bind to common target sites, they are less prone to be displaced by AML1/ETO expression. The two isoforms of AML1/ETO, AML1/ETO and AML1/ETO9a, may cooperate in patients to induce leukemia by blocking myeloid cell differentiation at a more immature stage.
Researchers investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase 2 (HAT2) in the parasite Leishmania donovani. They found that HAT2 is essential for the parasite's growth and survival, and its depletion leads to cell cycle defects and poor survival in host cells. HAT2 acetylates histone H4 at lysine 10 (H4K10), and this modification is crucial for the expression of specific genes involved in the cell cycle. The researchers discovered that HAT2-dependent H4K10 acetylation activates the promoters of cyclin genes CYC4 and CYC9, which are essential for the S phase and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, respectively. This activation occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with CYC4 and CYC9 being transcriptionally activated at specific stages of the cell cycle. The study reveals a two-tiered system of gene regulation in Leishmania donovani, where transcription of polycistronic units initiates at divergent strand switch regions (dSSRs) in a constitutive manner, and a subset of genes, including CYC4 and CYC9, have their own promoters that are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This second tier of regulation is sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels, and its disruption leads to downregulation of CYC4 and CYC9 expression in HAT2-depleted cells. The study provides new insights into the gene regulation mechanisms in Leishmania donovani and highlights the importance of HAT2-dependent H4K10 acetylation in cell cycle progression.
Researchers investigated how humans infer the intentions of others in social interactions using a computational modeling approach. In an economic game, 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, where one player received information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart and the other player, the adviser, provided an additional recommendation. The game was structured to vary the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information over time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, the researchers found that the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, where they inferred the volatility of the adviser's intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of the advice. This volatility estimate also affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions, with participants relying more on their estimates of advice accuracy when they believed the adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. The results suggest that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may be useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.
Scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, has traditionally been considered a rural disease in Asia. However, recent cases have been reported in urban areas, including Seoul, South Korea. This study aimed to investigate the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul and its clinical characteristics. The researchers analyzed national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013 and selected patients from a hospital that reported the majority of cases for detailed analysis. They also collected chigger mites in the city using a direct chigger mite-collecting trap and identified them using phenotypic and genetic analysis.

The study found 88 cases of urban scrub typhus in Seoul, with possible infection sites including mountainous areas, city parks, and the vicinity of residents' homes. Chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites, and identified as Helenicula miyagawai and Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Patients with urban scrub typhus showed mild clinical features, with low APACHE II scores and low complication rates.

The study confirms the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul and identifies H. miyagawai as a potential vector for the disease. The findings suggest that urban scrub typhus should be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases in endemic areas and a target for prevention. Further studies are needed to characterize the overall status of scrub typhus in Seoul and to determine the role of H. miyagawai in human infection.
Researchers investigated the role of the HEN1 homolog HENN-1 in the germline of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm. HEN1 is an enzyme that helps stabilize small RNA molecules by adding a methyl group to their 3' ends. The study focused on two types of small RNAs, 26G and 21U, which are involved in RNA interference (RNAi) pathways. RNAi is a process by which cells regulate gene expression by silencing specific genes.

The researchers found that HENN-1 has different effects on the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs. In the germline, the stability of 21U RNAs, also known as piRNAs, was only mildly affected by the loss of methylation. In contrast, most 26G RNAs displayed reduced stability and increased 3'-uridylation frequencies when HENN-1 was absent. The study also showed that HENN-1 specifically methylates 26G RNAs bound to the ERGO-1 protein, but not those bound to the ALG-3/ALG-4 protein.

Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants revealed mild effects, including the down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes. The researchers suggest that the effects on gene expression are largely indirect, resulting from the reduced levels of 26G RNAs. These findings provide new insights into the role of HEN1-like enzymes in RNAi pathways and the regulation of gene expression in C. elegans.
Researchers have conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human N-glycans, a type of sugar molecule attached to proteins. The study analyzed data from 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts and found that genetic variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. HNF1α, a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in the liver and pancreas, was found to be a master regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process, including the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. The study showed that HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α are necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. This discovery has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The study also found that HNF1α regulates the expression of fucosyltransferase genes, including FUT6, which is involved in the addition of the unusual sugar fucose to N-glycans. The results suggest that HNF1α plays a critical role in the regulation of fucosylation, a process that is altered in many diseases, including cancer and coronary heart disease.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Centromere Protein C (CENPC) plays a crucial role in the formation of kinetochores, the structures that attach chromosomes to the cytoskeleton during cell division. However, the DNA sequence of centromeres, the regions where kinetochores form, has little to no role in this process. Instead, RNA molecules transcribed from centromeres remain bound to the kinetochore region and are thought to be part of the epigenetic marking system.

A study on maize CENPC found that a specific region of the protein, 122 amino acids long, is responsible for binding to DNA. This binding reaction is highly sensitive to single-stranded RNA, which strongly promotes the binding of CENPC to DNA. The researchers also found that the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match the size and character of the RNAs present on kinetochores in living cells.

The study suggests that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. This process is thought to be an epigenetic mark that mediates the final and most stable state of kinetochore assembly. The researchers propose that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA.

The findings of this study support the idea that RNA plays a crucial role in centromere specification and kinetochore formation, and that CENPC is a key player in this process. The study's results also suggest that centromeric DNA does not function to recruit kinetochores until it is combined with specific epigenetic marks.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood body mass index (BMI) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The placenta, a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, was found to play a significant role in mediating the genetic causes of these traits. By examining the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), the study revealed that GWAS loci associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI were substantially enriched for placental eQTLs. This suggests that placental transcription in the womb likely influences postnatal body size.

The study found that the placenta is a highly relevant tissue for determining not only birth weight but also body weight in childhood. The researchers identified hundreds of transcripts controlled by genetic variants that influence these anthropometric traits, demonstrating the importance of placental transcription and related functions in determining birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI. The study also found that placental eQTLs are enriched to a greater extent for childhood obesity and childhood BMI GWAS hits compared to eQTLs from other tissues, such as adipose and liver.

The study's findings support the hypothesis that genetically controlled in utero expression patterns linked to birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI are important for understanding the mechanisms controlling these traits and developing clinical prevention strategies. The researchers discovered over 3,000 cis- and trans-eQTLs in the placenta, demonstrating its transcriptional activity and the role of fetal genetics in controlling this activity.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic but non-life-threatening disease that often goes undiagnosed and untreated in endemic areas. PKDL is a significant concern in the context of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination efforts. A study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India aimed to determine the disease burden, compare diagnostic tools, and assess lesion regression after treatment. The study found a prevalence rate of 27.5% among antileishmanial antibody-positive cases, with 26 PKDL cases detected through active surveillance and confirmed by PCR-based diagnosis.

The study compared three diagnostic methods: PCR, slit skin smear, and rK-39 rapid diagnostic kit. PCR was found to be highly sensitive (88.46%) for case confirmation, while the slit skin smear had a sensitivity rate of 15.38%. The rK-39 strip test was not conclusive due to the persistence of anti-leishmanial antibodies after L. donovani infections.

Treatment with sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or oral miltefosine resulted in persistent skin lesions in most cases, which gradually disappeared within 6-12 months post-treatment. However, two cases showed reappearance of lesions after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. The study highlights the need for active mass surveys to identify undiagnosed PKDL cases and achieve the goal of eliminating Kala-azar. A well-designed study with a larger sample size is necessary to determine when PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and to identify those requiring longer treatment periods.
Researchers have investigated the process of competence development in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other infections. Competence is a genetic program that enables the bacteria to take up new genetic material from their environment, a process called horizontal gene transfer. This process is crucial for the bacteria's survival and ability to adapt to changing environments.

The study found that competence development in liquid cultures of S. pneumoniae is a two-step process. A small fraction of cells initially switches to over-produce a signaling molecule called Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP). These cells then induce competence in the rest of the population through cell-to-cell contact.

The researchers discovered that CSP is retained on the surface of competent cells, allowing it to be transmitted to other cells through random collisions. This process promotes horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in S. pneumoniae, enabling the bacteria to evade vaccines, antibiotics, and host immune defenses.

The study also found that competence development is linked to the metabolic state of the cells and occurs independently of cell density. The timing of competence development is controlled by a growth-time dependent (GTD) mechanism, which is a previously unknown feature of S. pneumoniae. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex process of competence development in S. pneumoniae and highlights the importance of cell-to-cell contact in this process.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection requires the L2 protein to act as a chaperone for the viral genome (vDNA) to traffic from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/vDNA complex must translocate across limiting intracellular membranes. Researchers have developed a system to study this process using the enzyme BirA and its substrate to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. They found that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN, and only release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA revealed a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis. The vDNA egresses from the TGN to a pericentriolar location, accumulating there through prometaphase, where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and throughout anaphase, the vDNA is seen bound to the mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase. This is the first time a virus has been shown to functionally couple the penetration of limiting membranes to cellular mitosis, explaining in part the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to estimate the relative transmissibility, or "transmission fitness," of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. This framework is applied to data from "competitive mixtures" experiments, where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. The method involves observing the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission. The researchers demonstrate the approach using data from influenza experiments in ferrets.

The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is crucial in various contexts, including seasonal and pandemic interactions, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant strains due to the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The competitive mixtures animal model paradigm is applicable in all three contexts, making the mathematical framework presented here widely applicable in influenza research.

The framework also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum, which is the number of successfully infecting units transferred from the donor to the recipient. This measurement is essential for parameterizing epidemiological models of influenza transmission that consider the emergence and spread of NAI-resistant strains. The method is not limited to influenza and can be applied to other viral and bacterial pathogens, as long as the within-host dynamics of the two strains are considered and any competitive or synergistic effects due to co-infection are taken into account.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which plants integrate light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to adapt to their environment. ABA is a hormone that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, while light is a key environmental cue that regulates various aspects of plant growth. The study found that a protein called BBX21, which is involved in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. BBX21 acts upstream of several ABA-insensitive (ABI) genes and the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein, which is a direct activator of ABI5 expression. The researchers discovered that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. Additionally, ABI5 was found to directly activate its own expression, and BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI5. The study suggests that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. This integration is crucial for seed germination and early seedling development. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA, which is essential for plant adaptation and survival.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus that causes infections in humans. The Mediator complex is a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II and is conserved across eukaryotes. The study focused on three subunits of the Mediator complex in C. albicans: Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13. The results show that these subunits have some conserved functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as responding to certain stresses and regulating gene expression. However, the C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, including those involved in morphogenesis and the expression of cell wall adhesins.

The study found that Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, including filamentation and biofilm formation. The researchers also discovered that Med31 affects the virulence of C. albicans in a worm infection model. Furthermore, the study showed that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in regulating the expression of cell wall adhesins differ between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. In S. cerevisiae, these subunits repress the FLO genes, while in C. albicans, they activate the ALS genes. This suggests that the Mediator complex regulates adhesion in a distinct manner between these two distantly related fungal species. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of the Mediator complex in the pathogenesis of C. albicans.
Scientists have long known that bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than those growing freely in liquid, known as planktonic bacteria. To understand why, researchers studied the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in both biofilm and planktonic states, with and without the antibiotic tobramycin. They used a technique called transposon mutagenesis to identify which genes contribute to antibiotic tolerance in each state.

The study found that many genes play a role in antibiotic tolerance, but their importance varies depending on whether the bacteria are in a biofilm or growing planktonically. In fact, most genes that give bacteria a strong advantage in the biofilm state have only a weak or moderate advantage in the planktonic state. This suggests that the biofilm state itself plays a significant role in antibiotic tolerance.

The researchers also found that some genes contribute to antibiotic tolerance in one state but not the other. For example, genes involved in quorum sensing, a process by which bacteria communicate with each other, were more important in the planktonic state. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in biofilms and planktonic bacteria, which could lead to the development of new treatments for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FAMoS (Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection) to analyze complex biological systems. These systems are challenging to study due to many interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. FAMoS helps identify relevant factors and processes by evaluating the performance of multiple models against experimental data. Unlike existing algorithms, FAMoS can search large model spaces in a dynamic way, preventing it from getting stuck in local minima. It uses both local and non-local search methods to account for structurally similar processes.

FAMoS was tested and validated using simulated data and shown to be flexible in handling different model structures. The algorithm was also applied to experimental data on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured under various conditions. The analysis revealed dynamic changes in cell proliferation potential, with reduced proliferation in tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension cultures.

FAMoS is designed to handle complex systems dynamics within large model spaces and can be applied to various biological problems. Its flexibility in handling different model structures makes it a useful tool for data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces. The development of FAMoS addresses the need for improved model search and selection algorithms that can efficiently search large model spaces to provide a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics.
Researchers in Bolivia conducted a 12-month follow-up study to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BNZ) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive school-age children who received BNZ treatment, with seven blood samples taken during and after treatment. The researchers used serology, conventional diagnostic PCR (cPCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to assess treatment efficacy. They also measured levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, including IL-17A, in the children's blood.

The results showed that 73 children completed the follow-up period, with 6 (11%) showing both cPCR and qPCR positive results, 24 (42%) showing cPCR negative but qPCR positive results, and 27 (47%) showing both cPCR and qPCR negative results. The researchers found that IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and decreased to normal levels one year after treatment. IL-17A levels were also positively correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR.

The study suggests that IL-17A may be a useful biomarker for detecting persistent infection of T. cruzi and its chronic inflammation. The researchers propose that IL-17A levels could be used to determine the reactivity to BNZ treatment, with non-reactive subjects showing higher IL-17A levels than reactive or ambiguous subjects. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the factors contributing to treatment failure, particularly in the non-reactive group.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, with nearly 2% occupied by a small transposon called the Correia element. Researchers have identified eight subtypes of the Correia element, each with distinct ends, and found that two of these ends encode strong promoters. The activity of the strongest promoter is influenced by a specific polymorphism at the right end of the element. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the Correia elements can drive the expression of adjacent genes and may also produce small non-coding RNAs.

The study found that Correia elements exhibit strain-to-strain variability, with no more than two-thirds of elements maintaining their subtype at a particular locus. This variability is due to recombinational class switching between elements within a single strain, which can lead to the spread of new alleles through the population by natural transformation. This process may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism for phase variation in the meningococcus.

The researchers also discovered that the Correia elements encode numerous strong promoters, allowing for potentially widespread effects within the population. By defining the strength of the promoters encoded by the eight subtypes of Correia ends, the study provides a resource for predicting the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus. The findings suggest that natural variation in the distribution of Correia elements may contribute to the development or persistence of hypervirulent lineages responsible for most global meningococcal disease.
Researchers have identified two proteins, ChLae1 and ChVel1, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus that play a crucial role in regulating the production of a toxin called T-toxin. T-toxin is a key factor in the pathogen's ability to cause disease in maize, particularly in plants with Texas male sterile cytoplasm. The study found that ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin production, particularly in the dark, and that their absence or overexpression affects the pathogen's virulence and ability to produce the toxin. The researchers also discovered that ChLae1 and ChVel1 are involved in regulating the pathogen's response to oxidative stress and its development, including aerial hyphal growth, asexual sporulation, and sexual development. Furthermore, the study found that ChLae1 and ChVel1 negatively regulate the production of melanin, a pigment that helps protect the pathogen from oxidative stress. The results suggest that ChLae1 and ChVel1 are essential for the pathogen's ability to produce T-toxin and cause disease in maize. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogen's virulence and highlights the importance of ChLae1 and ChVel1 in regulating these processes.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels, which have been characterized as having distinct properties compared to their eukaryotic counterparts. By combining non-equilibrium simulation data with two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes, scientists have gained new insights into the selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels. The study focused on the bacterial NavAb channel and found that two or three extracellular potassium (K+) ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. This block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions, which can be "locked" in place by modest applied forces. In contrast, three sodium (Na+) ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose "knock-on" mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions. The non-equilibrium simulations predicted that the useful work required to break the K+ block is equivalent to large applied potentials experimentally measured for two bacterial Nav channels to induce inward currents of K+ ions. These findings illustrate how the inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes. The study's results are consistent with electrophysiological measurements of bacterial Nav channels and provide a new understanding of the mechanism of ion selectivity in these channels.
Researchers compared the spread of the rabies virus in dogs with the furious and paralytic forms of the disease. They found that the furious form had a more rapid viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres, as measured by viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies and viral RNA levels. In contrast, the paralytic form showed a slower spread of the virus, with less viral antigen in cell processes and a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement. This suggests that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. The study used image analysis to quantify the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes at different levels of the spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebrum in a cohort of naturally infected dogs. The results showed that the amount of antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of antigen in neuronal cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. The study also found that the furious form had greater amounts of antigen in cell processes at all anatomic levels examined, even when comparing neurons with similar amounts of antigen, similar percentages of involved neurons, and anatomic levels with 100% positive neurons. The findings suggest that host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, possibly mediated by cytokines, may contribute to the slower spread of the virus in the paralytic form.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in regulating gene expression in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. CTCF is known to act as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its function in Drosophila was not well understood. The team used a technique called chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in various regions of the Drosophila genome, including the Bithorax complex (BX-C). They found that CTCF binds to specific sites within the BX-C, including the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. These findings suggest that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, indicating a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The researchers also identified three additional presumptive insulator elements, "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4," which are correlated with the boundaries of regulatory domains. The study's results support the domain model of BX-C regulation, which proposes that regulatory elements are partitioned into independent chromatin loop domains to facilitate interactions between enhancers and promoters. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of CTCF in regulating gene expression in Drosophila and highlights the importance of CTCF in the functioning of insulators in the BX-C.
Scientists have long understood that enzymes recognize and bind to their substrates through a process called molecular recognition. This process often involves conformational changes in the enzyme that alter the local environment of the active site to facilitate efficient catalysis. A key concept in this process is adaptive substrate recognition, where the enzyme adjusts its shape to fit the substrate. However, characterizing this process at a structural level has been challenging due to its dynamic nature.

    Researchers have now provided a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution using a slow and tight-binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-peptide deformylase. By solving crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, as well as intermediate mimics captured during the process, the team was able to reconstruct the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. The results show that ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is then "zipped up" by additional binding interactions.

    This study integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of the slow-binding mechanism. The findings have implications for the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions and could inform the design of therapeutics that exploit induced-fit mechanisms. Slow and tight-binding inhibitors, such as actinonin, are of particular interest due to their unique inhibitory properties, including selective potency and long-lasting effects.
Researchers have investigated the role of the thalamus in relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex. They used a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to create a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway, mimicking the synaptic bombardment of cortical origin on thalamic cells. The study found that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key factors: the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the convergence from thalamus to cortex, the statistics of corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, the results showed that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by cortical feedback. The study proposes that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of retinocortical signal transfer. The researchers propose that a stochastic facilitation process emerging at the whole thalamic population level enhances global sensory information transfer in the presence of decorrelated corticogeniculate feedback bombardment. This process may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at the thalamic level.
Researchers have identified a protein called NMAD-1 that plays a crucial role in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Meiosis is the process by which sex cells, or gametes, are produced. NMAD-1 is a demethylase, an enzyme that removes methyl groups from DNA. Mutations in the NMAD-1 gene lead to reduced fertility in C. elegans, as well as defects in prophase I of meiosis. This results in reduced embryo production and an increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation.

Studies have shown that nmad-1 mutant worms have disorganized nuclear staging, mislocalized cohesin complex, and improperly condensed, fused, or lost chromosomes. RNA sequencing revealed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. The researchers used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify NMAD-1 binding proteins and found that it binds to multiple proteins that regulate DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2. NMAD-1 co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin and the majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1. These findings suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) as a key player in the early stages of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. HCMV is a common virus that can cause serious health problems in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a complex structure and can infect a wide range of human cells, but the exact mechanism of infection is not yet fully understood.

The study found that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and that knocking down APMAP expression significantly reduced the virus's ability to infect these cells. Conversely, over-expressing APMAP in cells that are normally resistant to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, made them more susceptible to the virus.

The researchers also found that APMAP helps the virus to enter cells by interacting with a specific protein complex on the surface of the virus, called gH/gL, and by facilitating the movement of a viral protein called pp65 into the cell's nucleus. Without APMAP, the virus was unable to enter cells as efficiently, and its ability to replicate was impaired.

Overall, the study suggests that APMAP plays a critical role in the early stages of HCMV infection and may be an important target for developing new treatments for HCMV-related diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells make decisions about which lineage to commit to. Traditionally, models of lineage commitment have focused on intrinsic factors, such as the expression of transcription factors within the cell. However, this new model incorporates both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the role of cytokines, which are signaling molecules that can influence cell behavior.

The model suggests that cytokine-mediated positive feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. The model supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, indicating that cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy cell-fate decisions.

Simulations of the model show that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state as well as the route of commitment chosen. The model also shows good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis that have been observed experimentally. Overall, this model provides new insights into how hematopoietic progenitor cells make decisions about which lineage to commit to and how external cues can influence these decisions.
Researchers have used electron cryo-tomography to study the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, a prototypic member of the Orthobunyavirus genus. This genus includes emerging viruses that pose a threat to human and animal health. The study reveals that Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape, with a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes protruding from the viral membrane. Each spike is approximately 18 nanometers long and becomes disordered when exposed to an acidic environment.

Using sub-tomogram averaging, the researchers derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to a resolution of 3 nanometers. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions, while intra-spike contacts occur at membrane-distal regions.

The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells. This change involves a major structural rearrangement in the head region of the trimeric spike, corresponding to the Gc fusion glycoprotein. The results provide the first detailed 3-D structural analysis of an orthobunyavirus and a model for this large group of medically important viruses. The study also reveals a unique mode of fusion glycoprotein oligomerization, distinct from that observed in other classes of fusion glycoproteins.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors contributing to primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a leading cause of irreversible blindness in Asia. The study focused on anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key anatomical risk factor for PACG. A total of 5,308 individuals of Asian descent were analyzed, and a significant association was found between a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs1401999) and ACD. This variant was also linked to an increased risk of PACG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 cases and 18,801 controls. The association was strengthened when controls with open angles were included in the analysis. The study suggests that genetic variants influencing ACD may contribute to the development of PACG. ABCC5 is expressed in anterior segment structures relevant to PACG, including the iris, ciliary body, and lens. The findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying PACG, a major global cause of blindness. The study's results may help identify individuals at risk of developing PACG, particularly in Asian populations where the disease is prevalent. Further research is needed to identify novel potentially functional polymorphisms related to PACG pathogenesis.
Researchers have identified the first examples of developmental enhancers that are conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, two distinct groups of animals. These enhancers, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores), show sequence and gene synteny conservation between the two groups. The discovery of Bicores suggests that these elements act as response elements to signaling pathways and drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Bicores encode complex patterns of transcription factor binding sites, and one example, Bicore1, has been shown to function as a Bmp responsive element.

The identification of Bicores provides a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves. However, the small number of identified Bicores implies extensive cis-regulatory rewiring between the protostome and deuterostome clades. Further research is needed to determine the true extent of cis-regulatory sequence and function conservation underlying animal development. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis-regulatory logic improves, it is predicted that more Bicores will be discovered. Alternatively, it is possible that some ancestral regulatory regions are conserved between these clades but have remained elusive due to limitations in our tools and sample of bilaterian genomes.
A recent study investigated the impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on the diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses within individual hosts. The researchers analyzed data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy and used next-generation sequencing to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus in 119 patient-derived samples. The study found that vaccination had a minimal impact on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 viruses, with most samples having fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome. The level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer.

Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers, respectively. This suggests that vaccine-induced immunity may not be a major contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. The study also found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual.

The researchers conclude that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. While the study did not evaluate the impact of vaccination on H1N1 or subtype B viruses, the findings suggest that the relationship between vaccine-induced immunity and intrahost diversity may be more complex than previously thought. Further research is needed to understand the evolutionary forces that shape the genetic structure of viral populations within hosts and ultimately give rise to novel antigenic variants at the host population level.
Researchers have developed a genetically modified, live attenuated form of the Leishmania donovani parasite, known as LdCen-/-, to study its potential as a vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a severe disease caused by this parasite. In a previous study, LdCen-/- was shown to induce a strong protective immune response in young mice. This new study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of LdCen-/- in aged mice, as age is a critical factor in determining the clinical outcome of VL. The researchers found that LdCen-/- induced a significant enhancement of innate effector responses in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from both young and aged mice, leading to an augmented CD4+ Th1 cell effector function. Additionally, parasitized splenic dendritic cells from LdCen-/- infected mice showed increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Immunization with LdCen-/- induced higher IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in both young and aged mice. However, the adaptive response, specifically T cell and B cell activation, was reduced in aged mice compared to young mice, resulting in less protection against virulent L. donovani parasites. Overall, LdCen-/- immunization induced a significant but diminished host protective response in aged mice compared to young mice.
Researchers created chimeric viruses by combining genetic material from enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) to study the role of capsid proteins in viral behavior. Enteric and respiratory EVs have distinct properties, such as acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, and tissue tropism, which determine their ability to infect specific parts of the body and cause disease. By exchanging capsid proteins between EV-D68, a respiratory EV, and EV-D94, an enteric EV, the researchers found that these proteins play a crucial role in determining acid sensitivity and tissue tropism. The study also showed that capsid proteins influence the optimal growth temperature of the virus, with EV-D94 adapting to higher temperatures through single mutations in the VP1 gene. In contrast, EV-D68 capsid proteins were unable to adapt to higher temperatures. Additionally, the researchers found that non-structural proteins, rather than capsid proteins, modulate the innate immune response in tissues. The study's findings provide new insights into the biophysical properties of EVs and could aid in the development of targeted therapies or vaccines against these viruses, which are responsible for a wide range of human diseases. The research highlights the importance of capsid proteins in determining the behavior of EVs and sheds light on the genetic regions responsible for their functional diversity.
The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI is a transmembrane Fc receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). This receptor can participate in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process where the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of the IgG bind a viral antigen while the Fc binds to gE-gI. Research has shown that IgG Fc binds gE-gI at basic pH, but not acidic pH, suggesting that IgG bound at extracellular pH by cell surface gE-gI would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed.

To investigate the fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI-bound IgG, researchers developed an in vitro model system for ABB and used 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging to track the trafficking of ABB complexes. The study found that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate the clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
Researchers have explored the transcriptome profiles of the protoscoleces (PSCs) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cystic hydatid disease in humans and animals worldwide. The study aimed to understand how PSCs interact with hosts and adapt to their environment. Using Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis, the researchers identified 26,514 nonredundant sequences, of which 22,910 were mapped to the E. granulosus genome. The analysis revealed 2,280 excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite, including 138 involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 involved in protein metabolism. Eleven ESPs were identified as intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, while 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and four proteases were highly represented. The study also found that many proteins were significantly enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. This research provides valuable insights into the metabolic adaptation of E. granulosus to its hosts, which can aid in the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of host-parasite interactions and the genomics of E. granulosus.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the protein NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is absent, NirA is primarily found in the cytosol and is inactive. However, when nitrate is present, NirA rapidly accumulates in the nucleus and becomes active. Researchers have discovered that a specific methionine residue in NirA's nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide in the absence of nitrate. This oxidation is dependent on the enzyme FmoB, a flavin-containing monooxygenase. The oxidation status of this methionine residue determines NirA's subcellular distribution and transcriptional activity. In the presence of nitrate, NirA's activation domain is exposed, while its NES is masked, preventing it from being exported from the nucleus. In the absence of nitrate, the methionine residue is oxidized, leading to the exposure of the NES and relocation of NirA to the cytosol. The researchers found that replacing the methionine residue with isoleucine, a sterically similar but non-oxidizable residue, resulted in partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export. In contrast, replacing the methionine residue with alanine led to NirA becoming a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. These findings suggest that the oxidation status of the methionine residue in NirA's NES plays a critical role in regulating its subcellular distribution and activity in response to nitrate availability.
Researchers studied how constraints shape the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels in mammals. These channels are crucial for allowing action potentials to propagate. Mathematical models have suggested that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for this to happen. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are highly similar in sequence. This similarity implies that their functional properties are also similar, consistent with the idea that these properties must be tightly constrained. However, the presence of multiple genes raises the question of why there are so many. The researchers demonstrated that the simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity - the requirements of membrane excitability and the uniqueness of the resting potential - directly constrain sodium channel properties. They compared these constraints with functional data on mammalian sodium channel properties collected from the literature, including 172 different sets of measurements from 40 publications. The data from all channel types, including mutants, obey the excitability constraint. However, channels expressed in muscle tend to obey the constraint of a unique resting potential, while channels expressed in neuronal tissue do not. The excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups that are consistent with phylogenetic analysis. The researchers' calculations suggest interpretations for the functional differences between these groups.
Researchers have identified a potential target for developing new antiviral drugs to combat influenza infections. The viral polymerase, responsible for transcribing and replicating the RNA genome, is an attractive target for antiviral drugs. A recent study focused on the endonuclease domain of the polymerase, specifically the PA subunit of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus. The study aimed to understand how specific metal chelating inhibitors bind to the endonuclease domain.

High-resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the pH1N1 PA endonuclease domain were obtained with a series of inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin. These compounds chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. The study found that different substituent groups on the basic metal binding scaffold can bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity, and that certain structural elements of the active site cavity are flexible, allowing for induced fit binding.

These findings are crucial for optimizing the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase. The study provides the first detailed structural information on specific inhibitor binding to the influenza polymerase, which will guide modeling and medicinal chemistry approaches to optimize lead compounds for more efficient inhibition of PA endonuclease. This research aims to develop novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics that directly target viral replication.
Researchers have developed an effective immunization protocol to produce potent polyspecific antivenom against three medically important vipers found in Thailand and neighboring countries: Calloselasma rhodostoma, Cryptelytrops albolabris, and Daboia siamensis. The protocol, known as the "low dose, low volume, multi-site" method, was used to immunize four horses with a mixture of the three viper venoms. The resulting antisera showed a rapid increase in ELISA titers against the three venoms and reached a plateau at around the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the three venoms was significantly higher than the minimal potency limits set by the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This effective immunization protocol has the potential to produce potent polyspecific antivenom against snake venoms and could be useful in the production of equine antisera against other diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies. The study demonstrates the successful production of potent, truly polyspecific antisera against the three vipers using the low dose, low volume, multi-site immunization protocol. The resulting antivenom has been commercialized in the form of F(ab')2 by QSMI and has the potential to save lives of victims of envenomation by the three and other related vipers in Southeast Asian countries.
Salmonella enterica, a type of bacteria, can cause long-term systemic infections in hosts despite a strong immune response. These infections can persist for months and are often asymptomatic, allowing the bacteria to be transmitted to new hosts through fecal shedding. Researchers have identified a bacterial effector protein called SseI, which is essential for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS) and inhibits the normal migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. This inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a regulator of cell migration. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with it at the cell periphery. A mutation in the C-terminal domain of SseI eliminates its function in vitro and in vivo, but not its ability to bind to IQGAP1. Infection with wild-type S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in an SseI-dependent manner, resulting in fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen compared to mice infected with a mutant strain lacking SseI. These findings demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which counteracts the host's ability to clear systemic bacteria.
Researchers have identified a key factor contributing to the high virulence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). The study found that the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus, by inhibiting the translation of the agrA gene. The agrA gene encodes a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene. The psm-mec RNA specifically binds to agrA mRNA and prevents its translation, thereby reducing the production of PSMα.

The study analyzed 325 clinical MRSA isolates and found that 25% had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% had no psm-mec. In most of these strains, PSMα expression was increased compared to strains carrying intact psm-mec. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and enhanced virulence in mice.

The researchers also found that one-third of HA-MRSA isolates from the Kanto area of Japan had a mutated psm-mec or did not carry psm-mec, and these strains produced high amounts of PSMα. The study suggests that the absence of psm-mec is a genetic determinant of the high virulence property of CA-MRSA, and that the transcription product of psm-mec acts to decrease the amount of AgrA in S. aureus cells.
Researchers have long observed that babies born to mothers who have had dengue fever are at higher risk of developing severe dengue when they contract the virus for the first time. This increased risk is thought to be due to a phenomenon called antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE), where antibodies from the mother bind to the virus but fail to neutralize it, allowing the virus to enter host cells and replicate more easily. To study ADE, scientists have used mice that are deficient in type I interferon receptors, which are proteins that help fight off viral infections. However, these mice are immunocompromised and do not accurately represent the human immune system.

In this study, researchers developed a new mouse model that is less immunocompromised and can be used to study ADE. They found that mice born to mothers who had been infected with one type of dengue virus (DENV1) were more susceptible to infection with a different type of dengue virus (DENV2) than mice born to mothers who had not been infected with dengue. The infected mice developed severe disease, including liver damage, vascular leakage, and low platelet and white blood cell counts. The researchers also found that blocking a protein called TNF-alpha, which is involved in inflammation, completely protected the mice from disease, while blocking another protein called IL-6 had no effect. This new mouse model can be used to study the mechanisms of dengue disease and to test potential treatments and vaccines.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. They analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was linked to the disease when diagnosed using the leishmanin skin test or clinical symptoms, but not when serological tests were used. Younger individuals were less likely to be infected, but more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were also associated with Leishmania infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not linked to the disease.

The study highlights the importance of dogs as a marker for visceral leishmaniasis in humans. Ecological studies showed a consistent association between dog seropositivity and human infection. The review found consistent patterns for some factors, including spatial clustering of cases, household conditions, vegetation near homes, and poverty, similar to those observed in South Asia. However, the results cannot be applied to other contexts due to the unique characteristics of the disease in the Americas.

The study emphasizes the need for further research in new areas of the continent, with improved methodological quality, to investigate the identified patterns and their causes, as well as variables with limited knowledge. The findings can inform the development of more effective and targeted control measures for visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas.
Inhalation of the bacterium Francisella tularensis (Ft) causes a severe and often fatal form of pneumonia known as pulmonary tularemia. Researchers have sought to understand the underlying mechanisms of this disease, but the exact causes of acute pathogenesis and death have remained unclear. A recent study has shed light on this mystery, revealing that an immature myeloid/myeloid-suppressor cell response plays a critical role in mediating lethal pulmonary tularemia. This response involves the recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the lungs, where they fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and ultimately, host death. This process is partially dependent on the presence of immature Ly6G+ cells. In contrast, during sub-lethal infection, the pulmonary cellular response is characterized by a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, which are essential for protection against the bacteria. The study suggests that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. The findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary tularemia and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat this disease.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential to transmit infectious diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. To mitigate its spread and disease risks, researchers reconstructed the complex colonization pattern of this mosquito using a combination of classical population genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches. The study analyzed populations from Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Basin, the Pacific Ocean islands, and North America.

The results show that in Southeast Asia, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan maintain high genetic connectivity, indicating their ancestral common origin. China appears to be the oldest population. In contrast, the invasion process in other regions, such as La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean Basin, is primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, which maintains a relatively high genetic diversity within adventive populations.

Independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae. albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in a great amount of intra-population variability. This variability may extend to the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, potentially contributing to the efficient transmission of arboviruses and outbreak establishment. The study's findings are valuable for developing models to predict the risk of vector outbreaks and assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in old and newly invaded areas where Ae. albopictus has become established.
Researchers investigated the factors that contribute to the fitness of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wound infections. They found that clinical isolates from human wounds were often defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that many genes involved in these processes were not necessary for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. In contrast, genes related to anaerobic growth, metabolic pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial survival in wounds. The researchers also discovered that high-density bacterial growth conditions, rather than virulence or biofilm functions, were a key factor in bacterial fitness in wounds. This suggests that chronic wounds may be relatively permissive environments where bacterial growth and nutrient acquisition can occur without the need for invasive or toxic functions. The study's findings provide new insights into the bacterial functions required for chronic wound infections and the stresses that affect bacterial fitness in wounds. The results also suggest potential therapeutic targets that could be used to compromise wound infection pathogenesis. The study used a mouse model of diabetic wound infection, which is relevant to human wound pathogenesis, and found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited wound healing in the model, directly linking infection to disease. Overall, the study sheds light on the complex interactions between bacteria and the host environment in chronic wound infections.
Researchers conducted a study on chronic hydrocele, a common manifestation of bancroftian filariasis, in a region where the disease is endemic. The study involved 1,128 patients who underwent hydrocelectomy and a comparison group of 218 patients who had previously undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy. The results showed that hydrocele recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients who underwent complete excision of the hydrocele sac (0.3%) compared to those who underwent hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy (19.3%). The study also found that per-surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were present in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in the two groups, respectively. Additionally, the testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients in the two groups, respectively. The study suggests that lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid that threatens the integrity of the testis in adult populations living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas. The authors recommend complete excision of the hydrocele sac and suturing or excision of leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels to prevent hydrocele recurrence. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic hydrocele in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas and highlights the importance of complete excision of the hydrocele sac in preventing recurrence.
Researchers have identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, TsUCH37, in the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis, which causes trichinellosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. This enzyme is a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein UCH-L5. Using an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, the researchers identified several potential deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in T. spiralis larvae lysate, including TsUCH37. The predicted gene encoding TsUCH37 was cloned, and the recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of TsUCH37 was verified using the Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation experiments showed that TsUCH37 associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 specifically inhibited recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. These findings suggest that the interaction of TsUCH37 with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution. The study highlights the potential use of inhibitor compounds to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and their investigation as therapeutic targets for trichinellosis.
Researchers have identified three non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors that show anti-trypanosomal activity against the CL Brener strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. These compounds, based on two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition, demonstrated activity in the 0.1-1 μM range. Two of the compounds, with EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25 μM, showed greater potency against the trypanosome than against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain. This suggests that their anti-trypanosomal activity may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a potential polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases.

The study also evaluated cathepsin K inhibitors based on a cyclohexane dicarboxamide scaffold, finding that two compounds showed significantly greater anti-trypanosomal activity than expected based on their cruzain inhibitory activity. This is consistent with previous research on the oral activity of cysteine protease inhibitor K777 in animal disease models and the efficacy of similar compounds in a murine Chagas disease model.

The results suggest that the anti-trypanosomal effects of the most potent compounds may be due to the inhibition of one or more cysteine proteases, including isoforms that have not yet been identified as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This raises the possibility that compounds 5 and 11 may have a polypharmacological profile, targeting isoforms of cruzipain or other cysteine proteases present in the parasite. The study's findings also suggest that phenotypic screening libraries for the discovery of antichagasic agents should include potent inhibitors of cathepsin K.
Researchers have created a detailed physical map of the maize genome, covering 93.5% of the genome and aligning 86.1% to the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genic markers, enabling the alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The study reveals that the maize genome has undergone significant expansion, with 1 kilobase in rice corresponding to an average of 3.2 kilobases in maize. This expansion is attributed to the recent polyploid origin of maize, resulting in most rice regions corresponding to two regions in maize. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome.

The researchers also found evidence of an ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of the progenitors of maize and rice. By reconstructing the paleoethnobotany of the maize genome, they determined that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes. The study sheds light on the organization of the chromosomes of the progenitors contributing to the maize polyploidization and the rearrangements associated with the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome.

Comparative analysis with rice and sorghum genomes revealed a whole genome duplication event, supporting the idea that the present maize genome emerged from tetraploidization of several ancient duplicated regions. The study also identified multiple duplication events contributing to the maize-complex duplication pattern, with several genome rearrangements occurring since the divergence of maize and rice.
Researchers have successfully generated infectious prions in a laboratory setting using a technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Prions are misfolded proteins responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system. The study aimed to mimic the early stages of sporadic prion disease, which occurs when a misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) forms spontaneously in the body. The researchers used PMCA to analyze the possibility of spontaneous generation of PrPSc and found that under standard conditions, it did not occur. However, they discovered that modifying the PMCA procedure allowed for the generation of PrPSc in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. The newly generated PrPSc was found to be infectious and caused a new disease phenotype in wild-type hamsters, characterized by unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. This study provides additional evidence supporting the prion hypothesis, which suggests that prions are composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein that replicates in the body without the need for nucleic acids. The findings also suggest that prion diversity may be greater than previously thought, and that new forms of infectious protein folding may result in novel disease phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a novel model, the Angular Velocity Detector Unit (AVDU), to estimate angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain. This model can accurately reproduce experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unexplained behaviors. The AVDU is based on electrophysiological data and is tested using behavioral data. The model suggests that the AV response is an evolutionary extension of the optomotor response.

The AVDU is a neurally based model that accounts for deviations in the corridor-centering response of the bee. It is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings on the walls. The model reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behavior. The summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer.

The researchers propose that the AV response in the bee is an extension of the optomotor pathway, allowing different detectors to be constructed by combining elementary motion detectors with varying response timescales. This model can be used to estimate distance by summing the detector output over time and over all parts of the visual field. The AVDU model provides a new understanding of how bees estimate angular velocity and navigate their environment.
Untreated Human Infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Are Not 100% Fatal

A long-term follow-up study of 50 human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients from the Ivory Coast has revealed that untreated infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the main agent of sleeping sickness, are not always fatal. The study found that 10 out of 11 patients who refused treatment despite repeated visits showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. This suggests that alternative natural progressions of HAT may occur, including progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection with negative results in parasitological tests and PCR.

The study, which used highly specific and sensitive laboratory tests, is the most comprehensive to date on the natural evolution of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in its human host. The findings demonstrate that trypanotolerance exists in humans, as is now widely accepted for animals. This is a major step forward for future research in the field of HAT. The study's results also suggest that a significant proportion of subjects displaying positive serologic test results but negative results in parasitological testing may be experiencing alternative infection courses.
Researchers investigated how ionizing radiation affects the development of cancer, specifically focusing on the role of the p53 gene, a key tumor suppressor. They used mouse models to study the effects of radiation on hematopoietic progenitor cells, which give rise to blood cells. The study aimed to determine whether radiation selects for p53-deficient cells, which can provide resistance to radiation-induced damage.

The results showed that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a significant selective advantage, leading to the long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. This selection is attributed to several factors, including protection from radiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of radiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors.

The study suggests that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation can be partly explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate elimination and long-term reductions in fitness following radiation. The findings indicate that the causal link between radiation exposure, p53 disruption, and cancers involves selection for p53 loss rather than solely irradiation-induced mutagenesis at loci encoding proliferation control genes.
Researchers have identified a protein called SmKI-1 in the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni that plays a crucial role in the parasite's survival and development. SmKI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can bind to the enzyme neutrophil elastase, which is a key component of the host's immune response. By inhibiting neutrophil elastase, SmKI-1 impairs the ability of neutrophils to kill the parasite, allowing it to survive and thrive in its human host.

Studies have shown that SmKI-1 has anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce neutrophil recruitment and elastase activity in various models of inflammatory diseases, such as liver damage and gout arthritis. The researchers used molecular docking studies to demonstrate that SmKI-1 binds to the active site of neutrophil elastase, blocking its activity. They also used siRNA to knock down SmKI-1 expression in the parasite and observed a significant impact on its development in vitro and in vivo.

The study suggests that SmKI-1 may be a promising therapeutic molecule for treating inflammatory diseases, as it can inhibit neutrophil function and reduce inflammation. Additionally, the researchers propose that SmKI-1's ability to interact with neutrophil elastase may be an immune evasion mechanism developed by the parasite to survive in its human host. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the role of SmKI-1 in Schistosoma mansoni survival and its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method for accurately modeling the structures of transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins, which play critical roles in various cellular functions. These proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of close structural homologues, making it challenging to predict their high-resolution structures. The new method uses distant homologues with distinct loop and TMH conformations to build accurate models of TMH protein structures. In a benchmark of 50 TMH protein pairs with diverse topologies, sizes, and sequence identities, the method improved most starting templates and achieved near-atomic accuracy in predicting membrane-embedded regions. The method was validated in two blind predictions and a large benchmark of membrane protein homologues with wide diversity in length, topology, and sequence identity. The technique was tested in two challenging blind predictions of membrane receptor structures, including the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors. The results suggest that the method can be useful in rebuilding and refining X-ray structures of membrane receptors where functionally important loop regions have missing densities or are often deleted to facilitate crystallization. The high-resolution prediction of membrane protein structures is crucial for designing more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel functions for systems and synthetic biology applications, which rely on atomic-resolution information. The new method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues.
Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a serious foodborne disease, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a persistent, vacuolar lifestyle in human epithelial cells. During infection, the bacteria initially proliferate in the host cytosol and use the host's actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell-to-cell. However, after several days of infection, the bacteria stop producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles called Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). A subpopulation of bacteria resists degradation in these vacuoles and enters a slow, non-replicative state. The bacteria can then cycle between the vacuolar and actin-based motility stages. When ActA is absent, such as in mutants, the bacteria enter a "viable but non-culturable" state, making them undetectable by conventional methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin selects for vacuolar and "viable but non-culturable" bacteria. These findings suggest that L. monocytogenes can enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells, potentially leading to asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation periods, and increased survival during antibiotic therapy. This new understanding of L. monocytogenes' lifecycle may have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of listeriosis.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanistic model of auditory bistability to study the phenomenon of auditory streaming, where sequences of high and low frequency tones are perceived as either a single stream or separate streams. The model combines neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate persistent alternations between integrated and segregated percepts. Unlike previous models, the proposed network model includes neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs that mimic the responses of primary auditory cortex (A1) to tones in the ABA-triplet pattern. The model incorporates mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise, as well as slow NMDA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory that enables linkage across sound gaps from one triplet to the next. Percepts in the model are identified in the firing patterns of the neuronal units. The researchers predict that manipulating the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. This prediction is confirmed by psychoacoustic experiments, and the behavioral data is used to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The model provides a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition. The study focuses on accurately reproducing the dynamics of alternations after the build-up phase, and its formulation is motivated by physiological studies of auditory streaming and general models of perceptual bistability.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the allergenicity of proteins from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni. This method uses a humanized cell line, called RS-ATL8, which can detect the presence of allergens. The researchers used a cell-free translation system to produce the S. mansoni proteins, which were then tested for their ability to activate the RS-ATL8 cells. The results showed that one of the proteins, SmTAL-1, was able to activate the cells, while another protein, SmTAL-2, did not. This suggests that SmTAL-1 is a potential allergen. The researchers also tested the method using other well-characterized allergens, such as Par j 2 and IPSE/alpha-1, and found that it was able to detect their allergenic properties. The method is suitable for high-throughput analysis and can be used to assess the allergenicity of S. mansoni proteins on a genome-wide scale. This could lead to a better understanding of the basis of allergenicity and the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection mechanisms. The method could also be used to develop safe and effective vaccines against helminthic parasites. The researchers demonstrated that the method is robust and can be used to assess the allergenicity of S. mansoni proteins in a format suitable for high-throughput analysis.
Researchers studied the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene expression in Drosophila virilis, a species that exhibits a hybrid dysgenic syndrome. This syndrome occurs when TEs inherited from the father are not matched with corresponding silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provided by the female germline, leading to germline damage and sterility. The study found that divergence in the TE landscape between parents is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression in offspring. These differences are transmitted to the next generation and coincide with increased levels of genic piRNAs, which are associated with reduced gene expression. The researchers also discovered that gene expression is influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents, which arise from polymorphic TE insertions. These findings support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. The study demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. The expanded repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA, leading to increased mRNA levels for FMR1. However, the basis for this increase in FMR1 mRNA expression is unknown. Researchers found that overexpressing histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3, 6, or 11 suppressed CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This suppression resulted from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat-containing transgene. The researchers also found that histone acetylation at the human FMR1 locus was increased in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS-derived cell lines. This epigenetic change correlated with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Furthermore, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repressed FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extended lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings suggest that the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling, leading to increased expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. The results also provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.
Host genetics play a crucial role in controlling CD8 T cell function and lethal immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Research has shown that specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles and the degree of MHC heterogeneity are associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function and viral control during human chronic infection. However, the extent to which host genetics influences the establishment of chronic viral infection is not fully understood. To examine the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection, researchers conducted a study using F1 crosses of B10.D2 x B6 (D2B6F1) and BALB.B x BALB/c (BCF1) mice infected with the clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The results showed that both H-2bxd D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice, but H-2bxd D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD8 T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice, indicating that mortality was CD8 T-cell-dependent. The study found that D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production, exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1, and induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice. The results suggest that increased functionality of the CD8 T cell response allows for more rapid viral clearance at the cost of enhanced immunopathology dependent on both MHC diversity and the genetic background of the host.
A recent study analyzed the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium responsible for anthrax, isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. The study found that five sublineages/subgroups of B. anthracis were present in the region, including A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009. These sublineages were detected using canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. The geographical distribution of the B. anthracis populations exhibited different canSNP characteristics from those of the strains isolated before 1990 in China. The A. Br. Ames subgroup was found to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces, whereas it was previously only found in Xinjiang.

The study also identified 36 MLVA15 genotypes among the 106 strains analyzed, with 21 of these types being first observed in this study. The strains collected from anthrax outbreaks in the recent decade were classified as subgroups A. Br. 001/002 and A. Br. Ames and identified as genotypes MLVA15-28, MLVA15-30, MLVA15-31, MLVA15-38, MLVA15-CHN3, and MLVA15-CHN18. The study found that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is gradually becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help promote the prevention and control of this important disease.
Researchers investigated the role of goblet cells in defending against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and related pathogens that cause severe diarrheal disease. They found that goblet cells produce a mediator called RELM-β, which recruits CD4+ T cells to the colon to promote the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This process helps to replace infected IECs and prevent the spread of the pathogen. The study used a mouse model infected with Citrobacter rodentium, a related pathogen, and found that mice lacking the RELM-β gene (Retnlb-/-) suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. The researchers discovered that RELM-β acts as a CD4+ T cell chemoattractant, rather than directly increasing IEC proliferation. They also found that mice lacking RELM-β had impaired CD4+ T cell recruitment and reduced production of interleukin-22 (IL-22), a cytokine that promotes IEC proliferation. Enema delivery of RELM-β to Retnlb-/- mice restored CD4+ T cell recruitment, increased IL-22 levels, and promoted IEC proliferation, reducing mucosal pathology. These findings demonstrate that RELM-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against enteric pathogens. The study expands our understanding of the role of goblet cells in host defense against enteric bacteria and highlights the importance of RELM-β in recruiting immune cells to the site of infection.
Researchers have identified a crucial interaction between the norovirus protein VPg and the eIF4G protein in the host cell, which is essential for the initiation of translation of the norovirus genome. Noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, use an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis, relying on interactions between VPg and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell. The study focused on the murine norovirus (MNV) and found that a 20-amino acid motif at the C-terminus of MNV VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. This interaction is conserved in all known noroviruses. The researchers used a combination of biochemical and biophysical assays, including pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry, to map the binding site on eIF4G and demonstrate that the MNV VPg C-terminus interacts with eIF4G in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the VPg binding site on eIF4G HEAT-1, which was confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. The study also showed that this site is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G HEAT-1, allowing for the formation of ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes. The functional significance of the VPg-eIF4G interaction was demonstrated by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation. These findings provide important structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G and reveal a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers investigated the conditions under which gene clusters evolve in bacterial genomes. Gene clusters are groups of genes that encode proteins involved in a common pathway and are often found near each other on bacterial chromosomes. Several theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of these clusters, including the selfish operon model, which suggests that clustered genes are more easily transferred between species, and the persistence model, which proposes that clustered genes are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. The researchers developed computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. They examined the selfish operon model, a Moran process with natural selection for gene clustering, and a model that includes selection and genome inversion. The results showed that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, but can evolve under certain conditions, such as a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and a high horizontal transfer rate. The selfish operon model remains a viable explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under these conditions. However, the model is unable to explain the observation that genes in clusters are sometimes arranged in the order of biochemical reactions, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be involved. The researchers also found that the persistence model, which does not require direct selection, can explain the clustering of essential genes.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, poses significant health and economic burdens in tropical regions. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe malaria due to the parasite's unique ability to adhere to the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of the PfEMP1 antigen, called VAR2CSA, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on the placenta's syncytiotrophoblasts. VAR2CSA is only expressed in the presence of a placenta, suggesting its expression is actively repressed in men, children, and non-pregnant women. Researchers have identified a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the var2csa gene that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. This uORF is present in the mRNA of parasites selected for CSA binding and those isolated from pregnant women, indicating that VAR2CSA is encoded by a bicistronic transcript. The presence of VAR2CSA in non-pregnant individuals, including children and men, suggests that post-transcriptional repression mechanisms may be at play, resulting in lower exposure to the immune system. The conservation of the var2csa gene in most Plasmodium falciparum isolates, including a homologue in the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi, highlights the selective pressure acting on preservation of this gene.
Researchers analyzed gene expression patterns in the blood of 34 children infected with dengue virus (DENV) in Nicaragua. The study aimed to understand the differences in gene expression between children with severe and non-severe forms of the disease. The analysis revealed distinct patterns of gene expression between children with and without shock, particularly in genes related to protein biosynthesis and mitochondrial function. In children with dengue hemorrhagic fever, certain genes associated with innate immunity, such as neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides, were overexpressed. A meta-analysis of the data, combined with previously published datasets, confirmed that DENV infection leads to significant changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolism. However, the study found that the interferon response, a key component of the immune response, was not consistently observed in patient samples by day 3-6 of illness. This suggests that the interferon response may be transient and not a hallmark of DENV infection. The study also identified a common set of genes that are up-regulated in all DENV-infected patients, regardless of disease severity. These findings highlight the complexity of DENV infection and the need for further research to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying disease severity. The study's results may contribute to the development of a systems biology approach to predicting disease outcomes in DENV-infected patients.
Researchers studied how a type of herpesvirus, called Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), infects its host. They found that MuHV-4 targets the olfactory neuroepithelium, a layer of cells in the nose responsible for detecting odors, for entry into the body. The virus uses a molecule called heparan sulfate (HS) to bind to the olfactory neuroepithelium, allowing it to enter the cells. This is a key step in the infection process, as MuHV-4 virions that cannot bind to HS are unable to infect the host.

The researchers observed that the olfactory neuroepithelium expresses HS on its surface, particularly on the apical neuronal cilia, which are hair-like structures that detect odors. The virus binds to these cilia and either infects the neurons or reaches the underlying microvilli of the adjacent glial cells and infects them. This suggests that the olfactory neuroepithelium provides an important entry point for MuHV-4 and potentially other herpesviruses.

The study also found that MuHV-4 exploits neurons for entry, even though it is not typically considered a neurotropic virus. The researchers propose that targeting the olfactory neuroepithelium with HS-based interventions could provide a general means of controlling herpesvirus infections. However, they also note that other factors may restrict MuHV-4 entry to the olfactory neuroepithelium, and further research is needed to understand the relationship between HS expression, virion binding, and infection.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism that helps control the virulence of Salmonella bacteria. The bacteria's ability to invade epithelial cells requires the expression of genes in the pathogenicity island I (SPI-1), which is tightly regulated and only activated under specific conditions. A study has found that CRP-cAMP, a metabolic regulator, plays a crucial role in silencing SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions. In the absence of CRP-cAMP, Salmonella strains showed a strong upregulation of SPI-1 genes during the mid-logarithmic growth phase.

The researchers discovered that CRP-cAMP modulates the level of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level. This regulation occurs through a newly identified regulatory motif within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the hilD gene. The study also found that the Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP and, when this repression is relieved, Spot 42 exerts a positive effect on hilD expression.

In vivo and in vitro assays showed that Spot 42 targets the 3'UTR of the hilD transcript through its unstructured region III. The findings highlight the biological relevance of the hilD 3'UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression. The study suggests that CRP-cAMP indirectly regulates virulence by affecting the post-transcriptional regulation of hilD, and that CRP-cAMP may be relevant for HilD-mediated regulation of virulence in response to environmental changes during the infection process.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG/CTG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription in the context of Huntington's disease (HD). They used two transgenic mouse lines, R6/1 and R6/2, which express a similar transgene at different sites and exhibit tissue-specific instability. The study found that increased transgene expression and chromatin accessibility correlated with higher CAG instability in R6/2 mice compared to R6/1 mice. High levels of transgene mRNA and specific histone marks, such as H3K4 trimethylation, were observed in R6/2 tissues, while H3K9 dimethylation was reduced. However, the levels of transgene expression and these histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with different CAG instability levels. The study also found that the levels of elongating RNA polymerase II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Additionally, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum but not in the cerebellum. The results suggest that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo and that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.
Researchers have identified specific genetic changes in the Enterovirus 71 (EV71) genome that contribute to its ability to infect and spread within the human body. EV71 is a highly virulent enterovirus that can cause a range of diseases, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. To understand how EV71 adapts to different sites of infection, scientists analyzed the genomic features of the virus in an immunocompromised patient with disseminated disease. By comparing five full-length genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens, researchers found three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period. These changes included a non-conservative amino acid change in the VP1 protein, a conservative amino acid substitution in protein 2B, and a silent mutation in protein 3D.

Infectious clones of the virus were created with and without these mutations, and in vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP1 mutation conferred a replicative advantage in neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was also associated with a second non-conservative mutation in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells. Comparative models of the EV71 VP1 variants suggested that the substitutions may alter interactions with host cell receptors, although no significant structural changes were observed. These findings indicate that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism, independent of the virus's lineage, and may have contributed to its dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient.
Researchers studied how certain bacteria, specifically those in the Streptococcus genus, recognize and respond to chemical signals called pheromones. These signals play a crucial role in a process called natural transformation, which allows bacteria to acquire new traits, such as antibiotic resistance. The study focused on a specific system called ComRS, which involves a protein called ComR that responds to a pheromone called XIP. ComR is present in most Streptococcus species, but its ability to recognize XIP varies between species.

To understand how ComR recognizes XIP, the researchers developed a test to measure the activity of ComR proteins from different Streptococcus species in response to XIP. They found that ComR proteins can be classified into three categories: strict, intermediate, and promiscuous, based on their ability to recognize XIP from different species. The researchers also solved the three-dimensional structure of ComR from one species, Streptococcus suis, to understand how it interacts with XIP.

The study revealed that the XIP-binding pocket in ComR is lined by a variable and a conserved face. The conserved face contributes to ligand binding, while the variable face discriminates among XIP peptides. This information can be used to predict novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity. The findings provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity and lay the groundwork for further studies on the role of ComRS in species-cross communication in the regulation of natural competence in Streptococcus species.
Researchers have studied the replication of centromeric DNA in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans to understand how centromeres are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. Centromeres are genetic elements that ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. In most eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained by epigenetic mechanisms, where DNA plays a less definitive role. The study found that each centromere in C. albicans is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. This early replication timing is a key feature of centromeres and is conserved among related strains and species. The researchers also discovered that epigenetic formation of new centromeres, called neocentromeres, is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, where the neocentromere becomes the first to replicate and is associated with components of the origin recognition complex (ORC). The study suggests that the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position. The researchers propose a model where the early replication of centromeric DNA is a key factor in maintaining centromere position and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. The findings provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms that govern centromere maintenance and have implications for understanding the inheritance of centromere position in eukaryotes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic factors associated with chronic back pain (CBP) in adults of European ancestry. The study included data from 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 cases of CBP, from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank. The study found a genome-wide significant association between CBP and a variant in the SOX5 gene (rs12310519), which was replicated in an additional 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample. This association exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis. The study also identified two other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant between CCDC26 and GSDMC (rs7833174) and an intronic variant in DCC (rs4384683). These findings suggest that genetic factors play a role in the development of chronic back pain. The study's results provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying CBP and may lead to the development of targeted treatments for this common and debilitating condition.
A study in Cameroon estimated the disease burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis, a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and pigs. The researchers used data from West Cameroon to calculate the number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy and the number of pigs infected with cysticercosis. They estimated that 50,326 people have neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy, representing 1.0% of the local population, and 15,961 pigs are infected with cysticercosis, which is 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual cost of T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon was estimated to be €10,255,202, with 4.7% of the cost due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% due to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The average number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost per thousand persons per year was 9.0. The study also found that the cost of inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a significant role in the monetary burden of T. solium cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease was higher than estimates for some other neglected tropical diseases. The study suggests that knowing the salary levels and prevalence of the disease can provide a rapid indication of the total cost of T. solium cysticercosis in a country.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called RsaA in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that can cause infections in humans. RsaA is a small RNA molecule that does not code for a protein, but instead regulates the expression of other genes. The study found that RsaA reduces the virulence of S. aureus by repressing the synthesis of a global transcriptional regulator called MgrA. MgrA is a master regulator of transcription that controls the expression of many virulence factors and accessory genes in S. aureus.

The researchers discovered that RsaA forms an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA, which are required for translation repression. As a result, RsaA causes enhanced production of biofilm and decreased synthesis of capsule formation in several strain backgrounds. Biofilm formation and capsule synthesis are important virulence factors that help S. aureus evade the host immune system.

The study also found that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection in mice. This suggests that RsaA plays a role in the complex interactions between S. aureus and the host immune system, moderating invasiveness and favoring chronic infections. The researchers propose that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host. This is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections.
Researchers have developed a new method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a critical step in the virus's life cycle. Uncoating occurs when the cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid disassembles in target cells, allowing the virus to establish a long-term infection. To study this process, scientists created a fluorescently tagged version of a host protein called cyclophilin A (CypA), which binds to the HIV-1 capsid. This tagged protein, called CypA-DsRed, was incorporated into HIV-1 particles and allowed researchers to track the disassembly of the capsid in real-time.

Using single-virus imaging, the researchers observed that CypA-DsRed remained associated with the viral core even after the viral membrane was removed. However, it was lost from the core in a process that was dependent on the stability of the core and the initiation of reverse transcription. The study found that most viral cores lost CypA-DsRed shortly after fusion with the host cell, while a small fraction remained intact for several hours. The researchers also observed that uncoating occurred both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane.

The new imaging assay enabled the visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells and revealed the spatio-temporal features of this process. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 uncoating and may lead to a better understanding of how the virus establishes a long-term infection.
Researchers investigated the patterns of oligonucleotide usage in prokaryotic genomes, including bacteria and archaea. They analyzed the frequencies of different-sized oligonucleotides, from di- to octanucleotides, in coding and non-coding regions. The study found that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. The researchers also discovered that oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, with most of this variation occurring in non-coding regions.

The study found that bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes.

The researchers also found that the differences between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria. Overall, the study provides new insights into the patterns of oligonucleotide usage in prokaryotic genomes and highlights the importance of short oligonucleotides in encoding information in these genomes.
Researchers have identified a previously unknown factor influencing meiotic recombination in humans. Meiotic recombination is a process that ensures the correct segregation of chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to genetic diversity. The study focused on two types of recombination: crossovers and noncrossovers. Crossovers involve the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, while noncrossovers involve localized gene conversion events.

The researchers analyzed recombination at six highly active hotspots in sperm DNA and found a novel form of biased transmission that affects noncrossovers but not crossovers. This biased transmission is thought to arise from differences in heteroduplex formation and mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. The study suggests that this form of biased gene conversion is a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, which may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome.

Interestingly, the biased transmission favors strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs, consistent with established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes. The researchers propose that this form of biased gene conversion may contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination, and thus to the evolution of genomic base composition. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of meiotic recombination and its role in shaping the human genome.
Researchers have developed a computational systems biology model to better understand how environmental chemicals and drugs affect human health. The model integrates toxicogenomics data, chemical structures, protein-protein interaction data, disease information, and functional annotation to identify potential molecular targets and link chemicals to diseases. This approach differs from existing computational chemical biology networks, which primarily focus on integrating drug information.

The model was built using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), which contains curated information on drug and environmental chemical associations with proteins. The researchers selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 unique compounds and 6,060 molecular targets involved in human disease. They then analyzed these associations to predict which chemicals may affect human health and identified new chemical-disease associations.

The model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, predicting potential risk factors for human health. It can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. The researchers demonstrated the model's power by applying it to chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, as well as potential protein targets for di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine. The model's predictions are supported by recent published studies, highlighting the potential of this approach to integrate toxicogenomics data with other data types.
Researchers have developed a new model to better understand how the brain processes sound. This model, called the network receptive field, reveals that primary auditory cortical neurons in the brain are more sensitive to a wider range of sounds than previously thought. Unlike traditional models, which assume a linear relationship between sound and brain response, the network receptive field model shows that brain responses are the result of complex nonlinear interactions between multiple features of the sound.

The network receptive field model consists of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly to predict neural responses to auditory stimuli. This model outperforms traditional models in predicting brain responses and reveals distinct nonlinear properties, including gain control and conjunctive feature selectivity. Gain control refers to the ability of the brain to adjust the strength of its response to certain sounds, while conjunctive feature selectivity refers to the brain's ability to respond to specific combinations of sound features.

The network receptive field model also shows that brain responses to natural sounds depend on multiple features that interact in structured nonlinear ways. This is in contrast to traditional models, which assume a simple linear relationship between sound and brain response. The model's ability to capture the complexity of brain processing has the potential to improve our understanding of how the brain recognizes and interprets sound. Overall, the network receptive field model provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of auditory processing in the brain.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates the mammalian circadian clock, a biological process that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to the 24-hour day-night cycle. The study reveals that a protein called casein kinase 2 (CK2) plays a crucial role in phosphorylating a protein called BMAL1, which is a core component of the circadian clock. Phosphorylation of BMAL1 at a specific site, Ser90, is a critical regulatory step in the circadian clock oscillator.

The study found that a protein called CRY acts as a repressor of CK2 activity, preventing it from phosphorylating BMAL1. CRY binds to CK2 and inhibits its activity, creating a negative feedback loop that helps regulate the circadian clock. The researchers also discovered that CRY has a dual function, not only repressing BMAL1-CLOCK-driven transcription but also repressing CK2 protein kinase activity toward BMAL1-S90.

In the absence of CRY, BMAL1 is hyperphosphorylated, suggesting that CRY plays a role in rhythmic BMAL1 modification. The study proposes a dual negative-feedback model in which CRY-dependent CK2-driven post-translational modification of BMAL1 is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian clock and highlight the importance of CRY in regulating CK2 activity and BMAL1 phosphorylation.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile, a substance produced by the liver that has antibacterial properties. Bile disrupts bacterial membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA, making it difficult for bacteria to survive. The study found that sublethal concentrations of a bile salt called sodium deoxycholate (DOC) can adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. The general stress response plays a crucial role in adaptation to bile, as mutants lacking this response are more sensitive to bile.

In addition to adaptation through gene expression changes, individual Salmonella cells can also become resistant to bile without prior adaptation. When a non-adapted Salmonella culture is plated on medium containing a lethal concentration of bile, resistant colonies appear at a frequency of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per cell. These resistant colonies are thought to arise from cells that were already resistant to bile in the previous culture. Genome sequencing of these resistant mutants revealed that alterations in the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery are a common cause of mutational bile resistance. However, not all resistant isolates are mutants, suggesting that some cells may have a physiological state that allows them to survive in the presence of bile. This phenomenon highlights the existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal bacterial populations and may illustrate the adaptive value of gene expression fluctuations.
Researchers have found that the E. coli chromosome is organized into compact, supercoiled domains, which are formed through both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. A specific prophage, Mu, is organized as a stable domain within the E. coli chromosome. This domain is bounded by the Mu termini L and R, which are 37 kilobase pairs apart on the Mu genome. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain depend on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, the Mu L end, the MuB protein, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis, and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations. In contrast, another prophage, λ, does not form an independent domain. Low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. The researchers propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by facilitating the topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The domain may also contribute to the long-term stability of the prophage by providing potential benefits to the host cell through a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage.
Researchers investigated the effect of primaquine (PQ) treatment on gametocyte carriage of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) in children in Papua New Guinea. PQ is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Pv relapses and also clears mature Pf gametocytes, reducing post-treatment transmission. The study found that PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which is comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. The majority of Pv and Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections had lower odds of gametocytes compared to single-species infections for both species. PQ treatment had no significant effect on Pv gametocyte density or the proportion of Pv infections carrying gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment were equally likely to carry gametocytes as first infections after PQ treatment. Pv relapses and new infections had similar levels of gametocytaemia, indicating that relapses contribute significantly to the Pv reservoir. This highlights the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv. The study suggests that PQ treatment should be used for all Pv infections to prevent relapses and reduce gametocyte carriage.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze the cycling of Rho GTPases between the plasma membrane and cytosol. Rho GTPases play a crucial role in controlling actin organization during various cellular processes, including migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The primary members of this family, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, have distinct downstream effects on actin remodeling, but their basic mechanism involves targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. The researchers hypothesized that the details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches.

Using a modeling framework, the researchers analyzed experimental data to reveal details of GDI-mediated cycling and distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. The analysis of Rac membrane cycling showed that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. The researchers presented non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase in multidimensional charts, which can be used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane-bound GTPase. This methodology can be applied to analyze glucose-stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells and assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni, typically focus on collecting data from school-aged children (SAC) due to their high likelihood of infection. However, adults are also likely to be infected, and their infection burden can impact the effectiveness of treatment strategies. Researchers used three different age-intensity profiles of infection to investigate how the age distribution of infection affects the recommended treatment coverage levels required to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) goals.

The study found that in regions with moderate prevalence, treating SAC only may be sufficient to achieve the WHO goals, regardless of the burden of infection in adults. However, in high-prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is necessary to meet the WHO goals. This suggests that treatment strategies should consider the burden of infection in adults, rather than relying solely on SAC data.

The study highlights the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age range, including adults, to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region. This is particularly crucial in high-prevalence regions, where a large proportion of the local infection burden may remain untreated if only SAC are targeted. The study also emphasizes the need for additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, to be collected in M&E programs.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict surgery targets in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a neurological disorder characterized by disruptive seizures. The model uses structural connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. The researchers validated the model by comparing simulated seizure onset times and network locations between patients and controls. They then used the model to simulate surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood before and after surgery. The results showed that patients with TLE tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more frequently than controls in the model. The model also identified regions in the left hemisphere, particularly in the temporal and subcortical areas, as the most common starting points for seizures in patients. Additionally, the analysis implicated regions in the contralateral and frontal locations that may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. The model predicted that patient-specific surgery, where resection areas are chosen based on individual model-prompted results, may lead to better outcomes than the standard clinical procedure. This study provides a first step towards developing a personalized computational model for epilepsy surgery, which could inform treatment strategies for individuals with TLE.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses various strategies to evade the host's antiviral defenses, including the use of viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) to block interferon and apoptotic signaling. Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which HHV-8's vIRF-1 protein inactivates a key pro-apoptotic protein called Bim. Bim is a member of the Bcl-2 family and plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in response to viral infection. The study found that vIRF-1 directly interacts with Bim and relocates it to the nucleus, where it is inactivated. This interaction is essential for vIRF-1's ability to promote viral replication and prevent apoptosis in infected cells. The researchers used various techniques, including immunofluorescence assays, western analysis, and co-precipitation assays, to confirm the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim. They also generated mutant versions of vIRF-1 that were unable to interact with Bim and found that these mutants were unable to promote viral replication. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim using a cell-permeable peptide reduced vIRF-1's ability to promote viral replication. These findings suggest that targeting the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim may provide a new strategy for controlling HHV-8 replication. This is the first report of an IRF protein interacting with a Bcl-2 family member and sequestering it in the nucleus to prevent apoptosis.
Researchers have discovered that a specific protein, αVβ6 integrin, plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response in the lungs. This protein is found on the surface of epithelial cells, which line the airways, and is upregulated in response to injury or infection. When αVβ6 integrin is present, it helps to moderate the severity of acute lung injury (ALI) caused by respiratory pathogens, such as the influenza virus. However, mice lacking this protein, known as β6 KO mice, are protected from severe ALI and have improved survival rates during influenza infection. This is due to reduced viral spread into the alveolar spaces and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines.

Further investigation revealed that the absence of αVβ6 integrin leads to the constitutive activation of lung macrophages, which are immune cells that play a key role in the immune response. These activated macrophages are characterized by high levels of type I interferon (IFN) signaling activity, which helps to protect against viral infections. The researchers found that the loss of αVβ6 integrin results in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which in turn leads to the activation of macrophages and increased type I IFN signaling activity.

Administration of exogenous TGF-β to β6 KO mice reduced the number of activated macrophages and decreased type I IFN signaling activity, resulting in a loss of protection against influenza infection. This suggests that the loss of αVβ6 integrin-mediated TGF-β activation is crucial for the protection against respiratory pathogens, including influenza and Sendai virus, as well as bacterial pneumonia.
Researchers at a reference center in Argentina analyzed the effectiveness of the Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) in diagnosing American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The LST is a diagnostic tool that measures the body's immune response to Leishmania antigens. The study included 733 cases of suspected leishmaniasis, with 93% classified as localized cutaneous, 7% with mucosal involvement, and less than 1% as disseminated. Diagnostic confirmation was achieved in 65% of cases through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases having a negative LST result among this group. In cases where smears were negative, the LST was also negative in 190 instances, but positive in 69 cases. The study found that the LST was effective across all age groups, with a high correlation with smear results. Lesions older than 21 days showed a significant correlation with positive results for both smears and LST. The findings support the use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, even in endemic areas. Standardization of the LST technique and further research are needed to optimize its use in managing suspicious clinical cases.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism contributing to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) by studying the effects of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) on human macrophages. Macrophages are immune cells that play a key role in the development of CAD. When exposed to oxLDL, macrophages transform into lipid-laden foam cells, a process that contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The researchers used a combination of open chromatin mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to study the changes in chromatin structure and gene expression in macrophages after oxLDL exposure. They found that oxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites, which correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. The researchers identified a transcription factor called C/EBP-beta as a key regulator of gene expression in response to oxLDL. They found that variants at CAD-associated loci were enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure, including a variant at the PPAP2B locus. This variant, rs72664324, was associated with increased C/EBP-beta binding and enhancer activity, leading to increased expression of the PPAP2B protein product, LPP3. LPP3 was found to be present in foam cells in human atherosclerotic plaques and was up-regulated by oxLDL exposure, resulting in increased degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms contributing to CAD risk and highlight the importance of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of a single round of mass treatment with azithromycin in reducing the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in districts with a TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9% in children aged 1-9 years. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of treatment for districts with a TF prevalence of 10% or higher. However, this approach may not be practical for districts with lower prevalence rates due to the time and resources required for surveys.

In eight Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5.0-9.9%, a single round of azithromycin mass treatment was administered to the entire district, achieving a mean coverage of approximately 80%. Population-based trachoma surveys were conducted in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts at least six months after the treatment. The results showed that each of the 18 evaluation units had a TF prevalence of less than 5.0%.

The study suggests that a single round of azithromycin mass treatment with 80% coverage may be sufficient to reduce TF prevalence to less than 5.0% in districts with a baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%. This approach could be a more practical and cost-effective strategy for eliminating trachoma in districts with lower prevalence rates. The study's findings provide optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Researchers have identified a key component in the immune response of plants, specifically in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins recognize pathogen effectors and trigger a robust immune response, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. However, the mechanisms behind these responses were not fully understood.

A functional genomic and biochemical genetic screen identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) that mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1. The study found that the dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death. Additionally, sustained CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors, WRKY8/28/48, to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth.

In contrast, CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production and contribute to PCD. The study demonstrates that Ca2+ signaling via specific CPKs plays a pivotal role in the diverse downstream signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by distinct intracellular NLR immune sensors. This research provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of plant immune responses and highlights the importance of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases in regulating immune signaling pathways.
Researchers in Mali used a statistical method called state-space forecasting to predict the incidence of Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. The study focused on the district of Niono, Mali, where the disease has a significant impact on public health. The researchers used data from 1996 to 2004 to develop a forecasting model that can predict the number of cases of Schistosoma haematobium for up to 5 months in advance. The model took into account seasonal and annual fluctuations in the disease, as well as external factors such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions.

The results showed that the forecasting model was reasonably accurate, with an average error rate of around 25%. The model was able to capture non-linear interactions between the disease and external factors, which is important for predicting the spread of the disease. The researchers suggest that this type of forecasting model could be useful for managing and assessing the impact of interventions to control Schistosoma haematobium in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially in other parts of the Sahel region. This could help to improve public health outcomes and reduce the burden of the disease on affected communities. The study highlights the potential of state-space forecasting as a tool for predicting and managing neglected tropical diseases like Schistosoma haematobium.
Researchers studied how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interacts with host cells to establish infection. They found that a viral protein called pp150 restricts HCMV gene expression in cells that are in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. This restriction is due to pp150's ability to bind to a protein called cyclin A, which is essential for cell division. The researchers created a mutant virus that cannot bind to cyclin A and found that it causes cells to become stuck in the S/G2 phase, preventing them from entering mitosis. However, the virus can still replicate in these cells.

The researchers also found that another viral protein, pUL21a, helps to maintain the S/G2 arrest by destabilizing cyclin A. When both pp150 and pUL21a are unable to bind to cyclin A, cells are forced to enter mitosis, leading to a significant decrease in cell viability and virus growth. This suggests that pp150 and pUL21a work together to synchronize the cell cycle and prevent the virus from entering mitosis, which is essential for productive HCMV infection.

The study highlights the complex interaction between HCMV and host cells, and how the virus has evolved mechanisms to manipulate the cell cycle to its advantage. The findings provide new insights into the biology of HCMV infection and may have implications for the development of antiviral therapies.
Researchers investigated the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons and leads to paralysis and death. Approximately 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, with the remaining 10% being familial. The study used a targeted sequencing approach to analyze 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. The results showed a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases compared to controls, suggesting that these variants may be linked to ALS.

The researchers used a combination of functional studies, bioinformatics tools, and rare variant analysis to assess the relevance of newly identified variants to the disease. They found that cases had a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls, supporting the idea that novel or rare mutations in key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques in understanding the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease.

The researchers identified new variants in known ALS disease genes, as well as in genes associated with ALS, and found no association between several previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ALS in their population, with the exception of APOE. The study suggests that approximately 40% of sporadic ALS cases may have no identifiable genetic cause using the current sequencing method and set of candidate genes.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus. They found that IL-6 is crucial for the recall of influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells. In mice deficient in IL-6, the memory CD4+ T cell response was significantly impaired, while the memory CD8+ T cell response remained unaffected. The study suggests that IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can suppress the activity of other immune cells. In the absence of IL-6, Tregs were able to suppress the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells, leading to a diminished immune response. The researchers propose that IL-6 plays a critical role in ensuring that Tregs do not down-modulate the immune response during an acute infection with a cytopathic virus, thereby favoring pathogen clearance and host survival. The study highlights a novel role for IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-mediated immunity to respiratory viruses.
Researchers have identified a new function of the glycolytic enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enolase, known for its role in converting 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, was found to interact with the Dnmt2 protein, a cytosine-5 methyltransferase involved in DNA and tRNA methylation. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screen, and further studies revealed that enolase acts as an inhibitor of Dnmt2 activity. The inhibitory effect of enolase on Dnmt2 was found to be antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls this non-glycolytic function of enolase. In the absence of glucose, enolase accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with the Dnmt2 homolog Ehmeth, leading to a reduction in tRNAAsp methylation in the parasite. The role of enolase as a Dnmt2 inhibitor was confirmed in E. histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal-fused enolase. This study establishes enolase as the first Dnmt2-interacting protein and highlights an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity. The findings also suggest a link between glucose metabolism and Dnmt2 activity, and raise questions about the significance of this interaction in higher eukaryotes.
Researchers have discovered microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically in the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are known to transmit diseases such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are typically found inside cells. However, circulating miRNAs have been detected in human serum and saliva, but not previously in mosquito saliva. The study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, including 31 previously unknown miRNAs. Some of these miRNAs were found to be expressed only in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. The researchers tested five of these saliva miRNAs and found that they play a functional role in the transmission and establishment of CHIKV infection during blood feeding on the host. Inhibiting these miRNAs decreased viral replication, suggesting that their presence and upregulation in mosquito saliva enhance CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host. This study is the first to report the identification of exogenous mosquito saliva microRNAs and provides new insights into the mechanisms of mosquito-borne disease transmission. The findings have implications for the development of new strategies to prevent or treat mosquito-borne diseases.
Researchers have investigated the role of three nuclear proteins, Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p, in the repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins are involved in double-strand break repair (DSBR) in the nucleus, but their function in mtDNA repair was not well understood. The study found that Rad51p and Rad59p are localized to the mitochondria and bind directly to mtDNA. A restriction endonuclease was used to create a double-strand break in the mitochondrial genome, allowing researchers to study mtDNA repair in vivo. The results showed that loss of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous mtDNA deletions and impaired the repair of induced mtDNA double-strand breaks. The study also demonstrated that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p impact the rate of spontaneous mtDNA deletions and the repair of induced mtDNA double-strand breaks in yeast. This is the first study to show that these proteins are involved in the repair of specific mtDNA lesions. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of mtDNA repair and suggest that Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.
A systematic review examined the relationship between social determinants of health and the risk of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). These conditions disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations worldwide. The review included 90 studies from 1,164 publications, assessing factors such as crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, and socioeconomic status. The majority of studies (57.1%) reported a significant association between socioeconomic determinants and the risk of GAS infection, and 50% reported a significant association with ARF/RHD. Crowding was the most frequently assessed factor, with 14 studies examining its relationship with GAS infection and 36 studies examining its relationship with ARF/RHD. The majority of studies found a positive association between crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment status, and nutrition, and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. The Bradford Hill criteria for evidence of causation were met for crowding and socioeconomic status. However, the quality of the studies was variable, with 49 (50.5%) being of poor quality. The review highlights the need for high-quality, interventional studies to better understand the relationship between social determinants and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, and RHD.
Researchers studied the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network, a well-studied two-component system found in many bacteria. They found that a single point mutation in the PhoQ protein, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a significant change in the network's behavior. The mutant protein responds to stimuli in a bistable manner, meaning it can exist in two distinct states: an "on" state and an "off" state. This is in contrast to the wild-type protein, which has a graded response to stimuli. The mutant cells in the "on" and "off" states have different morphologies, and their state is inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the "on" state. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that the bistability depends on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoQ. The mutant's bistable behavior comes at a fitness cost, with the "on" state having a lower fitness than the "off" state in certain conditions. However, due to the high inheritance of the "on" state, a population of "on" cells can become epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlights the tradeoffs in the PhoQ/PhoP system.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but deadly infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Current treatment options are limited and often ineffective, making it a significant public health concern. To address this issue, researchers have turned to "drug repurposing," a strategy that involves using existing medications to treat rare or neglected diseases. One potential target for PAM treatment is the enzyme sterol 14-demethylase, also known as CYP51, which is essential for the production of ergosterol, a critical component of the amoeba's cell membrane. CYP51 is a well-established target for antifungal drugs, and its similarity to fungal orthologues raises the possibility of repurposing existing antifungal medications for PAM treatment. In this study, researchers investigated the effectiveness of anti-fungal azole drugs, known as conazoles, against N. fowleri. They found that these drugs disrupted sterol biosynthesis and reduced the viability of the amoeba. The researchers also identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate in N. fowleri and analyzed the interactions between the enzyme and conazoles using spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. The results validate CYP51 as a potential target for PAM treatment and suggest that conazole drugs, such as fluconazole and miconazole, may be effective against N. fowleri. These findings provide a promising lead for the development of new treatments for PAM.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) in maintaining and recalling protective immunity to nematode infections. Nematode parasites trigger a type 2 immune response in the host, which is mediated by IL-4Rα. However, it was unclear whether IL-4Rα is required for maintaining this response after it has been established. To address this question, the researchers used a mouse model where the IL-4Rα gene could be deleted at specific times. They found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is necessary for maintaining type 2 immune responses and protecting against nematode infections. When IL-4Rα signaling was disrupted after the immune response had been established, the mice were unable to clear the infection. Furthermore, the researchers found that IL-4Rα signaling is also required for the recall of type 2 immune responses during secondary infections. When IL-4Rα signaling was disrupted before a secondary infection, the mice had a reduced ability to clear the infection. These findings suggest that IL-4Rα plays a critical role in maintaining and recalling protective immunity to nematode infections, and that its signaling is necessary for optimal type 2 immune responses. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nematode immunity and highlights the importance of IL-4Rα in protecting against these parasites.
A global analysis of Bartonella bacteria, which cause various human infections, reveals the impact of human activity on the distribution of these pathogens in mammals. The study analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes to date, including 67 new genotypes, and found that the genus likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The research also shows that there is exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. This highlights the importance of avoiding contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife to protect public health.

The study's findings demonstrate that Bartonella is a valuable system for studying the effects of human activity on the spread of infectious diseases within and between species, across landscapes, and globally. Phylogenetic inferences about the origin of infections should be interpreted with caution due to the influence of available data and sampled taxa. The study's global phylogenies of Bartonella from 16s rRNA genes and citrate synthase (gltA) genes provide insights into the evolutionary history of Bartonella, patterns of host switching, and geographic constraints, as well as its spillover into humans or from human commensals into wild species. The research suggests that ecological factors, rather than immunological incompatibility, contribute to the host specificity of Bartonella.
A long noncoding RNA called MALAT1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression. Research has shown that MALAT1 is overexpressed in cancer tissues and is associated with increased cell proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism of MALAT1's role in cell cycle progression was not well understood until now. Scientists have found that MALAT1 levels change during normal cell cycle progression and that it modulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Specifically, MALAT1 is required for the G1/S and mitotic phases of the cell cycle. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to the activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, and its target genes. The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells display reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. These findings suggest that MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. The study provides new insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation and its potential contribution to tumor progression.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. In the migratory locust, JH promotes adult reproduction by stimulating DNA replication and increasing ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown the JH receptor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met), in locusts, mimicking a JH-deprived condition. They found that JH stimulates the expression of Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes involved in DNA replication, and that depletion of these genes inhibits de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, leading to reduced vitellogenin mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation.

Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Met directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs. This suggests that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. The study provides new insights into the molecular basis of JH action in promoting adult reproduction and highlights the importance of Mcm4 and Mcm7 in this process. The findings also suggest that JH acts on Mcm genes to facilitate the replication of the fat body genome, leading to the expression of vitellogenin required for oocyte maturation in locusts.
Researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal duration of prednisolone treatment for leprosy patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI). The study, known as the "Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Leprosy" (TENLEP) trial, compared the effectiveness of 20-week and 32-week prednisolone courses in restoring and improving nerve function. A total of 868 patients were included in the study, with 429 receiving a 20-week course and 439 receiving a 32-week course. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at 78 weeks.

The results showed that the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the two groups, with 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm. Additionally, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes, except for a higher proportion of serious adverse events in the longer treatment arm. The study found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. The researchers concluded that a 20-week course of prednisolone is the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which only a minority of patients may require further individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk and European Red Deer to understand the relationship between sound complexity and anatomy. They created a computer model of the larynx and vocal tract based on the anatomy and biomechanics of the two species. The model simulated the production of different types of calls, including the elk's high-pitched bugle and the red deer's low-pitched roar.

The study found that the elk's high-pitched bugle requires more muscular effort and lung pressure than the red deer's low-pitched roar. However, the elk's bugle is more efficient in terms of converting aerodynamic energy into sound energy. This is because the elk's vocal folds are able to vibrate more efficiently at high frequencies, resulting in a higher glottal efficiency. Glottal efficiency is the ratio of radiated sound power to aerodynamic power at the glottis.

The researchers suggest that the elk's high-pitched bugle may serve as an honest signal of muscular strength and endurance, while the red deer's low-pitched roar may signal overall body size. The study also found that the elk's auditory system may be better suited for high-pitched sounds than low-pitched sounds. The findings provide new insights into the evolution of vocal communication in cervid species and highlight the importance of glottal efficiency in sound production.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, which is a technique used to map transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. The traditional method of analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a reference genome, known as uni-reads. However, this approach can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads.

The new approach, called multi-read analysis, allocates reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, the researchers found that incorporating multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths and leads to the detection of novel peaks that are not identifiable with uni-reads alone. This approach also improves the detection of peaks in mappable regions.

The researchers investigated the characteristics of peaks detected only by multi-read analysis and found that they have similar characteristics to peaks identified by uni-reads, except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. They further validated a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identified novel target genes of GATA1. These results establish that multi-reads can be critical for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments. The incorporation of multi-reads can increase sequencing depths by up to 25% and lead to the identification of novel binding sites in highly repetitive and low mappability regions.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits to individuals of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs): human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. These diseases are controlled or eliminated through innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). The study combined data on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs with projections of the number of people affected, country, and year for 2011-2020 and 2021-2030. The researchers compared an ideal scenario where the WHO's 2020 targets are met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation in 1990 remained unchanged. The economic benefit was calculated as the difference between the two scenarios.

The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be $23.1 billion in 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion in 2021-2030. The reduction in OPPs was estimated to be $14 billion in 2011-2020 and $18 billion in 2021-2030. The study found that the economic benefits of achieving the targets far exceed the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners. Given the higher frequency of NTDs among the poorest households, these investments represent good value for money in improving well-being, distributing the world's prosperity more equitably, and reducing inequity.
A long-held assumption in neuroscience is that neurons with higher selectivity, or the ability to respond to a narrower range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a recent study in the auditory cortex challenges this notion. Researchers found that the amount of information encoded by a population of neurons about sound inputs is not dependent on the selectivity of individual neurons, but rather on the total number of spikes in the population.

In the auditory cortex, neurons initially respond to a wide range of sounds immediately after sound onset, and then become more selective and responsive to specific sounds during the sustained response epoch. This has led to the prevailing theory that the initial, less selective responses encode the presence of sounds, while the more selective sustained responses encode the identity of sounds. However, the study found that the population of neurons conveys similar information about sound inputs across both epochs, despite the differences in selectivity.

The researchers discovered that the amount of information encoded is almost entirely dependent on the total number of population spikes in the read-out window, and that inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property. This challenges the prevailing theory and suggests a novel principle of sensory encoding that may be shared among multiple sensory systems. The findings raise new questions about the nature of dynamic stimulus encoding in sensory systems.
Researchers have found that the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 plays a crucial role in controlling persistent viral infections. In contrast to acute viral infections, where the immune system can clear the pathogen, chronic viral infections require sustained T cell responses to prevent viral replication and spread. While inhibitory signals, such as PD-1, have been well-studied, the role of stimulatory signals in maintaining anti-viral T cells has been less understood. This study investigated the importance of OX40 in the context of persistent LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) clone 13 infection. The results show that OX40 is essential for the maintenance of anti-viral T cells, as mice lacking the OX40 receptor failed to accumulate sufficient T cells and were unable to control the infection over time. Furthermore, the emergence of germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies was severely impaired in OX40-deficient mice. The study found that OX40 promotes the long-term survival of T cells and shapes both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses during persistent LCMV infection, including T cell-dependent antibody responses. The findings highlight the importance of OX40 in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence and have implications for understanding T cell dysfunction in persistent viral infections in humans.
Researchers have identified a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. This optimal method, characterized by a specific ratio of undulation length to fin amplitude, is found in a diverse group of aquatic animals, including cuttlefish, cartilaginous and bony fish, and other invertebrates. This ratio, known as the optimal specific wavelength (OSW), is consistently around 20 and maximizes the force generated by the body, resulting in faster swimming speeds.

The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation in these phyla may be influenced by common genetic networks, similar to those found in the convergent evolution of the electric organ. By analyzing the OSW and mean undulation amplitude, the researchers can predict the number of undulations required for a swimming animal to cruise at any velocity. This phenomenon unifies a wide range of swimming organisms, from invertebrates to vertebrates, and highlights the importance of understanding the links between physical principles and biological phenomena.

The study also explores why slower forms of swimming, such as those exhibited by median/paired fin animals, have emerged and thrived despite the prevalence of body/caudal fin swimming in ancestral species. Further evidence supporting this idea comes from the convergent evolution of anatomical specializations in thunniform swimmers, such as tuna and lamnid sharks, which minimize trunk movement during tail fin movement, resulting in faster swimming speeds.
Researchers have investigated the roles of two types of protein complexes, condensins I and II, in the division of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing cerebral cortex. These cells divide symmetrically to proliferate and asymmetrically to generate neurons, and accurate chromosome segregation is crucial for this process. The study found that both condensins I and II are essential for NSC divisions and survival in mice, and simultaneous depletion of both complexes leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, causing DNA damage and triggering cell death. Individual depletions of condensins I and II result in slower loss of NSCs compared to simultaneous depletion, but display distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation is more prominent in NSCs depleted of condensin II, while mitotic delays are detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects are also observed in postmitotic neurons. The study demonstrates that condensins I and II have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and provides insight into the intricate balancing acts of these two complexes.
Researchers studied the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni as it develops from a larval stage to an adult in its human host. The parasite has a unique reproductive system, where sex is determined by a female heterogametic system, but phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the host. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind this process, the researchers analyzed the transcriptome of S. mansoni at five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages, and adults. They found that 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between males and females in at least one developmental stage, and 4,065 of these genes were functionally annotated. The researchers also analyzed the histone modification H3K27me3, which is involved in epigenetic regulation, and found differences in its distribution between males and females at different developmental stages. These findings suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. The study provides new insights into the host-parasite interaction and the reproductive function of the parasite, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for treating schistosomiasis, a disease caused by S. mansoni that affects millions of people worldwide.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to model disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. This approach assigns a confidence value, or posterior probability, to each annotation, indicating its likelihood of being correct. Two probabilistic models were developed and tested using computer simulations and a large dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts. The models were also applied to a 1,000-sentence subset annotated by five new experts. The results show that even when all annotators disagree, the approach can significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation. The study aims to improve existing curation methods by providing a holistic approach to quantify certainty in individual annotations and retain the complete dataset for training and testing machine learning methods. A manually annotated corpus of 10,000 sentences is made publicly available, which can be used to train computers to perform well-defined annotation tasks at a large scale. The study suggests conducting small-scale annotation experiments to estimate error rates specific to the task and annotator experts, which can be used to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert with a known correctness rate. The proposed approach is general and can benefit most data annotation studies.
Researchers have developed a potential treatment for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (ANDV) and ANDV-like viruses in South America. The treatment involves using a DNA vaccine to produce antiviral biologics, including neutralizing antibodies, in geese. The geese are vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the ANDV envelope glycoproteins, resulting in the production of high-titer neutralizing antibodies in their eggs. These antibodies, known as IgY and IgYΔFc, are then purified from the eggs and shown to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences on the ANDV envelope glycoproteins.

The researchers tested the protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibodies in a hamster model of lethal HPS. Hamsters were challenged with a lethal dose of ANDV and then treated with either immune sera or purified IgY/IgYΔFc from the eggs of vaccinated geese. The results showed that 8 out of 8 hamsters treated with immune sera and 7 out of 8 hamsters treated with purified IgY/IgYΔFc survived the infection, while all hamsters receiving no treatment or IgY/IgYΔFc from non-vaccinated geese developed lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate the potential of the DNA vaccine/goose platform to produce a candidate antiviral biologic capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure. The use of geese as a source of neutralizing antibodies offers several advantages, including the ability to produce high concentrations of antibodies and a well-defined lineage of birds.
Research has shown that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a significant role in the development of human cancers. The Dnmt3a enzyme is essential for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dnmt3a have been linked to leukemias. In a mouse model of lung cancer, deletion of Dnmt3a was found to promote tumor progression, suggesting that the enzyme may suppress tumor development by maintaining DNA methylation patterns. To investigate this further, researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to analyze DNA methylation patterns in Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. The results showed that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors had large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains, while Dnmt3a-deficient tumors had a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is necessary for maintaining methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer and uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes.
Researchers have identified a specific pattern of neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds that supports the generation of sparse sequences of neural activity. This pattern is characterized by a length scale of 100 micrometers, within which basal-ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm. The study used multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging to examine the neural activity in the premotor cortex of singing birds. The results show that the activity patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered, with two cell types, HVCX projection neurons and HVC interneurons, firing in alternating phases of the local 30 Hz rhythm. Inhibitory neurons exhibit patterned activity throughout song, while projection neurons fire sparsely, with calcium events correlated in time between neighbors. This suggests a microcircuit in which multiple pools of excitatory neurons drive local interneuron populations. The study's findings raise the possibility that spatial clustering and 30 Hz rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells may be a recurring feature of cortical motor microcircuits and critical for the sequential organization of behavior. The results have implications for future studies of songbird vocal learning, suggesting that biophysical models of motor sequence generation in the HVC should consider the interplay of spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition.
Researchers investigated the role of evolutionarily conserved genes in regulating lifespan in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They screened 2,700 genes essential for the worm's development and identified 64 genes that, when inactivated post-developmentally, extended the worm's lifespan. These genes are highly conserved across species, from yeast to humans, and are involved in various cellular processes, including insulin and metabolic pathways, translation, RNA, and chromatin regulation. Many of these genes are essential for growth and development, but their role in longevity had not been previously assessed.

The researchers found that inactivating these genes early in development caused growth arrest at the larval stage, and some of these arrested animals lived longer than wild-type adults. The transcription factor daf-16 was required for the enhanced survival of arrested larvae, suggesting that the increased longevity is a physiological response to the essential gene inactivation. These findings suggest that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulating aging at any stage of life.

These results are consistent with previous studies that have identified specific components of cellular processes that regulate lifespan. For example, loss-of-function mutations in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1/daf-2 signaling pathway have been shown to double the lifespan of C. elegans. The regulation of lifespan by daf-2 occurs during adulthood, and lifespan can be extended when fed dsRNA targeting the insulin receptor/daf-2 at any developmental larval stage through adulthood.
Researchers have identified a critical step in the process of zebrafish fin regeneration, which involves the formation of a specialized epidermis that instructs growth from the underlying stump tissue. A forward genetic screen was conducted to identify mutations that impair this process, and a temperature-sensitive allele of the ECM component laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) was found to block fin regeneration. Lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This process facilitates the expression of morphogenetic factors, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone.

The induction of lamb1a is dependent on Fgf signaling, and its function is essential for the localization of signaling receptors, expression of key morphogenetic signals, and osteoblast patterning. In contrast, lamb1a is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. Fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression, suggesting a link between a central growth factor and epithelial maturation during regeneration. The study reveals that transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key, growth factor-guided step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis.
Researchers compared different methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using family-based data. They tested six linear mixed model (LMM) approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, on a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. The study found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The LMM results were also highly correlated with alternative approaches, such as MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. The study concluded that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches and are a convenient and robust method for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits. The choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power or type I error considerations. The study used a combination of real and simulated data from a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazilian families to evaluate the performance of the different LMM approaches. The results suggest that LMM approaches can offer higher power than traditional family-based association analysis approaches.
Researchers have identified three new compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, that show promise in treating Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The compounds were discovered through a high-throughput screening of a 2000-compound chemical library using a recombinant T. cruzi strain that expresses β-galactosidase. The three compounds demonstrated high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells in vitro, with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively. Each compound has a distinct mechanism of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, NT1 having a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affecting parasite division. The compounds also exhibited high activity against T. cruzi from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Further analysis of chemically related molecules led to the identification of two compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values of 2 nM, approximately 100 times lower than current medicines used to treat T. cruzi. These findings provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
Researchers have developed a novel diagnostic platform, called "Backpack PCR," for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes. This platform combines a rapid DNA extraction method using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with a portable, battery-powered PCR (polymerase chain reaction) device and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. The platform is designed to be used in the field, eliminating the need for expensive and bulky laboratory equipment.

The researchers compared the performance of the NaOH-based DNA extraction method to traditional silica column-based methods and found it to be effective in extracting DNA from mosquito pools. They also compared the test strip-based detection assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating its sensitivity and specificity in detecting parasite DNA.

The Backpack PCR platform was tested on 50 mosquito samples, and the results showed that it was comparable to real-time PCR in detecting Brugia malayi DNA. The researchers believe that this platform has the potential to greatly expand the reach of molecular xenomonitoring (MX) efforts for lymphatic filariasis, a disease caused by Brugia parasites. The platform is also adaptable to detecting other mosquito-transmitted pathogens, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, which is responsible for 90% of the global lymphatic filariasis burden.

The Backpack PCR system is compact enough to fit into a small backpack and does not require advanced laboratory infrastructure, making it suitable for use in resource-limited settings. The researchers believe that this platform has the potential to increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring in areas where it is needed most.
Researchers have developed a theoretical model to study the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins, which are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements. These proteins have evolved independently multiple times in nature and are characterized by their ability to stretch and recoil. The model uses a simulation environment that mimics the self-assembly of rod-like particles with different domain architectures. By analyzing the resulting aggregates using graph-theoretic metrics, the researchers found that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the polymeric structure. For example, polymers constructed from asymmetric rods with large cross-linking elements and smaller elastomeric domains were found to be the most highly connected and structurally stable. This study provides insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and may also guide the design of new biomaterials with tunable properties. The researchers used a modified implementation of a diffusion-limited aggregation model to simulate the self-assembly of elastomeric molecules, represented by circular rods composed of elastomeric and cross-linking domains. The study's findings suggest that the arrangement of these domains is crucial for the formation of stable polymeric structures, and that the model can be used to predict the structural integrity of elastomeric proteins based on their domain architecture.
Researchers have investigated the role of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) genome. The EBOV genome is longer than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to the presence of long 5' and 3' UTRs in its seven transcriptional units. The study found that the EBOV 5'-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes), but instead regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The 5'-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a β-actin 5'-UTR. The L 5'-UTR contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablating each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (pORF). The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation and was surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence, which suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. The presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. Mutating the L uAUG in a recombinant EBOV attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells, and decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection.
Researchers have developed a method to precisely map DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, revealing non-random fragmentation and hotspots of DSBs scattered along chromosomes. These hotspots delimit protected DNA domains, approximately 50-250 kilobases in size, which contain coordinately expressed genes. About 30% of these domains, called "forum domains," possess genes that are turned on or off together. The study found that the protein PARP1 and the RNA processing factor HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind to DNA sequences at the ends of forum domains. This suggests a novel type of gene regulation, where DSB hotspots and PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites work together to control the expression of gene clusters within large chromosomal domains. The research highlights the relationship between chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for understanding cancer genomics and gene therapy. The study's findings also suggest that the binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at the ends of forum domains may influence coordinated transcription within these domains. The researchers believe that further study of HNRNPA2B1's role in chromosomal domains is warranted, as it has not been previously considered to function with PARP1. The study's method for mapping DSBs can also be used to study fragile chromosomal sites in various types of human cells.
Researchers studied trypanosomatids, a group of parasites, in bats from two areas in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The areas had different levels of preservation and connectivity. The study aimed to determine if the diversity of trypanosomatids changed according to bat diversity and the level of preservation in the region. The researchers found that the level of preservation did not affect the number of bat species, with 15 and 14 species found in each area. Two common fruit-eating bat species, Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus, were more abundant in both areas. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed, 24 (13%) were infected with trypanosomatids. The most common parasite was Trypanosoma dionisii, followed by Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV, and Trypanosoma sp. in Neotropical phyllostomid bats. Mixed infections were also observed. The study also identified Crithidia mellificae, a parasite typically found in insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas for the first time. The results show that bats in the Atlantic Forest harbor a diverse range of trypanosomatids, maintaining the diversity of these parasites in the sylvatic environment. The study highlights the importance of including parasites that can potentially infect humans in studies of local biodiversity, particularly in areas with high human population density, such as Rio de Janeiro.
Ticks, specifically the Ixodes ricinus species, are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe. These ticks can transmit a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Research has shown that ticks can be co-infected with multiple pathogens, increasing the likelihood of co-transmission to humans or animals. However, there is a lack of data on co-infection prevalence and interactions between pathogens and symbionts in ticks.

A recent study analyzed 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens collected in the French Ardennes and found that 45% were co-infected with up to five different pathogens. When including symbionts, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. The study also found a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, but no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens.

The study used high-throughput real-time PCR to detect 37 pathogens and four symbionts in the ticks. The results showed that half of the ticks carried at least one pathogen, and half of the infected ticks were co-infected with at least two pathogens. The most prevalent pathogens found were those causing Lyme disease, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. The study highlights the high co-infection rates in ticks and raises concerns about the potential co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, as well as the role of symbionts in pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hematopoietic stem cells decide which lineage to commit to, specifically the erythroid-myeloid lineage. This decision is governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1, which are turned on and off in a switch-like manner. Prior to commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels, allowing for rapid deployment of transcription factors to implement specific genetic programs.

The researchers found that dynamical models based on known interactions between PU.1 and GATA-1, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to produce a bistable system, which is necessary for robust lineage determination. To address this, they proposed a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated and recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, enabling bistability and switch-like behavior.

The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment. This genetic switch is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through the recruitment of cofactors. The researchers suggest that perturbing the feedback between master regulators and downstream targets could lead to reprogramming strategies for lineage commitment. This approach provides a framework for understanding lineage commitment in general and could aid in the search for lineage-determining genes.
Researchers investigated the role of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) in the virulence of Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen with high resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. They found that the decoration of EPA is essential for the bacterium's resistance to lysozyme and its ability to evade the immune system. This decoration is mediated by a complex network of genes, including oatA, pgdA, dltA, and sigV, which work together to inhibit lysozyme's enzymatic and cationic antimicrobial peptide activities.

The researchers used random transposon mutagenesis to identify additional genes involved in lysozyme resistance. They found that mutations in a locus referred to as the EPA variable region, located downstream of the conserved epaA-epaR genes, increased the bacterium's resistance to lysozyme. This region is responsible for decorating the EPA polysaccharide, and the researchers showed that this decoration is essential for the bacterium's virulence in a zebrafish model of infection.

The study reveals that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections, and that the modification of this surface polymer is crucial for the bacterium's pathogenesis. The findings suggest that the decoration of EPA plays a key role in the bacterium's ability to evade the immune system and cause disease.
Researchers have developed a new statistical model called RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation) to analyze gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This model combines data from two large databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). TCGA provides information on genetic and epigenetic factors such as copy number variation, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression, while ENCODE offers data on transcription factor (TF) binding. RACER infers the regulatory activities of TFs and microRNAs in each sample, which are then used to predict gene expression levels. This two-stage regression framework overcomes a common challenge in integrating data from different sources.

In a case study, the researchers applied RACER to AML data from TCGA and TF binding data from ENCODE. They verified the model's accuracy through 10-fold cross-validation and demonstrated its ability to recover known regulatory interactions. RACER outperformed existing methods in detecting known microRNA/TF targets. The model also identified 18 regulators whose activities were consistent with cytogenetic risk groups in AML. One of these regulators, miR-548p, was found to target genes involved in leukemia-related pathways, suggesting a novel role in AML pathogenesis. Additionally, survival analysis using RACER's inferred activities identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker. Overall, RACER provides a novel framework for integrating TCGA and ENCODE data to reveal AML-specific regulatory programs at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA silencing in the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum, which causes disease in a wide range of crops worldwide. They generated knock-out mutants affecting genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Dicer-like, and Argonaute proteins to study the function of RNA silencing in this fungus. The study found that mutants lacking Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and Argonaute 1 (AGO1) proteins showed severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Analysis of total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations revealed that the greatest effects were observed in these mutant strains, where a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 (ChNRV1), was derepressed. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 showed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA. The study found that the conidiation and spore morphology defects were primarily caused by ChNRV1. The results suggest that RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum functions as an antiviral mechanism to maintain low levels of accumulation of ChNRV1. The study provides new insights into the role of RNA silencing in fungal pathogens and its potential as a defense mechanism against viruses.
A recent study investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF in meiotic expansion of H2AX phosphorylation and spermatogenesis in mice. The study found that MOF is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion, which occur during meiotic prophase I. The first wave is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptonema, while the second and third waves are ATR-dependent and occur at zygonema and pachynema, respectively. The third wave of H2AX phosphorylation marks and silences unsynapsed chromosomes.

MOF deletion in spermatocytes using Stra8-Cre resulted in global loss of H4K16ac and defective spermatogenesis. In Mof cKO mice, γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In early-mid pachytene spermatocytes, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, leading to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure.

The study also found that MOF facilitates meiotic double-strand break (DSB) repair after RAD51 recruitment. RAD51 was proficiently recruited to DSB sites, but defects in DSB repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof cKO spermatocytes. The results suggest that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from the leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively.
Researchers investigated the effects of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) on human T-cell development in a mouse model that mimics the human immune system. The study found that HTLV-1 infection altered the development of T-cells in the thymus, leading to an increase in mature T-cells and a decrease in immature T-cells. This was observed in mice infected with HTLV-1 at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes were present. The study also found that the proviral load of HTLV-1, which is the amount of viral genetic material present in the cells, correlated with the extent of T-cell development alterations. In mice with a high proviral load, mature T-cells predominated at the expense of immature and double-positive thymocytes. Additionally, the study found that HTLV-1 infection led to the activation of T-cells, as shown by the expression of CD25, and an increase in the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bfl-1. The study also observed pathological features in some infected mice, including hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoma/thymoma. These findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection can lead to the development of T-cell malignancies and that the mouse model used in this study can be a useful tool for understanding the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1. Overall, the study provides evidence that HTLV-1 infection can disrupt the normal development of T-cells in the thymus, leading to an increase in mature T-cells and a decrease in immature T-cells.
A comprehensive schistosomiasis control project was implemented in the Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 to 2011. The project aimed to reduce the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly Schistosoma haematobium infection, among the local population. A total of 482,902 people were targeted, with 78,615 primary school students being the main focus of the intervention. The study found that the overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection at baseline was 28.5%, while the prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 0.4%. After 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection decreased to 13.5%. The reduction in prevalence was more pronounced among girls, those with moderately infected status, and residents in rural areas. Health education and the construction of a drinking water facility at Al Hidaib village also contributed to the reduction in infection rates. However, no significant change was observed in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection between baseline and follow-up surveys. Approximately 200,000 people received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or access to clean water as part of the project. The study highlights the importance of integrated control measures, including health education and clean water supply, in reducing the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Nipah virus matrix protein (NiV-M) in viral budding, a critical step in the life cycle of the virus. Nipah virus is a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. The study found that NiV-M translocates to the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished viral budding.

The researchers discovered that a highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: it mediated nuclear import and was a potential site for monoubiquitination, which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding, while depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell blocked viral budding. The study also found that live Nipah virus budding was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with the FDA-approved drug bortezomib reducing viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM. This suggests that proteasome inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic option against acute Nipah virus infection. Overall, the study highlights the importance of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M in viral budding and identifies a potential target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers have developed a new imaging technique to study how the poliovirus (PV) enters and infects cells. PV is a nonenveloped virus that causes poliomyelitis and is closely related to other human viral pathogens. The team used a dual-labeled PV, where the viral capsid and RNA were labeled with distinct fluorophores, to visualize the entry process in live cells. They combined this imaging technique with biochemical assays to measure RNA release and characterize early events in the infection process.

The results show that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through an endocytic mechanism that is independent of clathrin, caveolin, and flotillin, but dependent on actin and tyrosine kinase. After internalization, the virus releases its genome from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100-200 nanometers of the plasma membrane. This process is rapid and efficient, and does not limit the overall infectivity or infection rate of the virus.

The study resolves a long-standing debate on whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. The findings suggest that endocytosis is the primary mechanism of PV entry and genome release. The imaging technique used in this study is expected to be broadly applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for other nonenveloped viruses.
In rural Cambodia, dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, particularly among children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) relies heavily on health education to prevent and control the disease. However, an evaluation of community and school-based health education programs in eastern Cambodia found that these efforts are insufficient, underfunded, and irregular. Community health education is delivered through outreach activities and campaigns, but lacks systematic evaluation and follow-up. School-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial.

Health education plays a crucial role in informing and encouraging individuals to take responsibility for preventing and controlling dengue. However, in resource-poor countries like Cambodia, economic, political, and infrastructural factors complicate the effectiveness of health education. Local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education, offer potential to reduce dengue prevalence. However, these efforts are hindered by poorly resourced and episodic health education, as well as a lack of attention to translating knowledge into practice.

The study highlights the need for sustained, routine education for dengue prevention and control, as well as approaches to ensure the translation of knowledge into practice. Factors such as political commitment and availability of educational resources also impact outreach activities. The study suggests that existing dengue health education messages, materials, and strategies must be redefined to be practical, applicable, and relevant, and that health practitioners require training in health education techniques to effectively deliver these programs.
Researchers investigated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the bloodstream of infected hosts. Filarial nematodes cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. The study found over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. Two specific miRNAs, miR-71 and miR-34, were detected in infected dog samples using stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. These miRNAs were also found in Brugia pahangi-infected dog samples. The presence of these miRNAs discriminated infected samples from uninfected samples, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for filarial infections. However, the absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia, which may be due to the imprecision of mf counts or the unknown number of adult worms present. The study also found that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs are present in plasma or serum even for species that do not live in the bloodstream, such as Onchocerca volvulus. This research provides new insights into the molecular basis of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of novel diagnostic tools for filarial infections.
Researchers have developed a new understanding of how Src kinases, a type of enzyme involved in cellular signaling, transition from an inactive to an active state. Src kinases undergo significant structural changes during this process, which has been difficult to study due to the transient nature of the conformational switching. To address this challenge, the researchers created a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain of the Src kinase, incorporating experimental structures of the inactive and active states. Using this model, they simulated the dynamics of conformational transitions and identified two major pathways for activation.

The first pathway involves a coordinated switching mechanism among the αC helix, the activation-loop, and the β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In the second pathway, the conformational change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region of the catalytic domain. The researchers also characterized the switching mechanism for the αC helix and the activation-loop in detail. Additionally, they tested a Markov model to account for the structural kinetics in the context of Src conformational changes.

The study provides a framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation. The researchers used a structure-based coarse-grained model to investigate the Src conformational changes on the free energy landscapes. They explored the detailed conformational landscape by clustering the configurational space and constructing a detailed structural network from simulations. The results suggest that the large-scale motions in the Src conformational activation take place on a relatively slow timescale, which is beyond the reach of brute-force all-atom simulations.
Researchers have identified a key gene, TTG2, that plays a crucial role in the lethality of hybrid offspring from crosses between plants with different numbers of chromosomes. This phenomenon, known as postzygotic lethality, acts as a barrier to speciation in plants. The study focused on Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant, and found that a single gene, TTG2, is responsible for the lethality of hybrid offspring from crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals.

The researchers used a technique called quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify the genetic basis of the lethality. They found that a single large-effect QTL, DSL1, was associated with the lethality, and further analysis revealed that this QTL is encoded by the TTG2 gene. The study showed that loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the lethality caused by paternal excess in interploidy crosses.

The researchers also found that the frequency of cellularization in the endosperm, a critical process in seed development, was affected by both natural variation and TTG2 loss-of-function mutants. This suggests that the developmental programming of the mother plant plays a crucial role in regulating the viability of hybrid offspring. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying postzygotic lethality and its role in plant speciation. The discovery of a single gene, TTG2, that can mediate reproductive isolation by ploidy and fertility restoration highlights the potential for rapid evolution of F1 lethality in polyploids.
Researchers conducted a comparative study on the co-evolutionary patterns of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents, focusing on Bartonella and Leptospira species. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. The study found significant co-evolutionary congruence between Bartonella and both their rodent and bat hosts at a global level. In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant. Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed that Bartonella exhibits significant co-evolution with minimal host switching in both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has a high number of host switches. The study suggests that these variable co-evolutionary patterns are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. The findings have implications for predicting spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how undulatory swimmers, such as fish and eels, move through the water. This framework, called the forced damped oscillation framework, helps explain how muscle contractions and environmental forces work together to create the complex movements seen in these animals. The study used a chain-link model to simulate undulatory swimming and found that the forcing frequency, or the rate at which muscles contract, relative to the natural frequency of the swimmer's body is crucial in determining the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. This means that relatively simple muscle contractions can lead to complex movements.

The researchers also found that the power generated by muscle contractions is used to create body deformations, which are then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A mathematical expression was derived to describe the swimming velocity of the animal. The study showed that the movement of undulatory swimmers is an emergent behavior that arises from muscle activation, and that the deformation kinematics, or the pattern of movement, is critical in producing forward translational motion. The study also found that typical swimming motions involve lower deformation modes, and that the pathway of power transfer during the swimming cycle is an important factor in determining the efficiency of swimming.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of undulatory swimming and have implications for understanding the optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming. The study's results were confirmed by computational fluid dynamics simulations, providing further evidence for the validity of the forced damped oscillation framework.
Researchers have found that genetic recombination between human and animal parasites can create new strains of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), which causes sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in East Africa. This parasite is morphologically indistinguishable from its non-human infective subspecies, T. b. brucei (Tbb), which infects animals. A single gene, SRA, is responsible for the human infectivity of Tbr, and it can be transferred to Tbb through sexual reproduction, creating new strains of the human pathogen. The researchers demonstrated this by crossing genetically engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines of Tbr and Tbb through tsetse flies and tracking the inheritance of SRA. The results showed that SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds, creating new strains of Tbr with no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility. The SRA gene exists as a single copy in most Tbr strains, but some Ugandan isolates have it on both homologues of chromosome IV. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. The study suggests that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junction coupling in the development of Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a condition caused by dysfunction of β-cells in the islets of Langerhans. Gap junctions allow electrical communication between β-cells, coordinating insulin secretion in response to glucose levels. However, in NDM, gap junction coupling can suppress insulin secretion. The study used a computational model to simulate islet electrical activity and insulin secretion in the presence of ATP-insensitive KATP channels, which are associated with NDM. The model predicted that reducing gap junction coupling can recover insulin secretion and calcium (Ca2+) levels in β-cells. Experiments confirmed these predictions, showing that decreasing gap junction coupling allowed for increased glucose-stimulated Ca2+ and insulin secretion in islets expressing ATP-insensitive KATP channels. The study also found that stochastic noise, or random fluctuations in cellular activity, played a significant role in the recovery of islet function. The researchers applied the model to predict the effects of different mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, which cause NDM, and found that reducing gap junction coupling could recover islet function in many cases. These findings suggest that targeting gap junction coupling may be a novel therapeutic approach for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes. The study highlights the importance of considering the multicellular nature of islet function and the role of gap junction channels in exacerbating the effects of decreased cellular excitability.
Researchers have long sought to predict the behavior of complex biological networks by analyzing their individual components, or modules. However, these modules often exhibit context-dependent behavior, making it challenging to accurately predict their performance when connected to other modules. One reason for this context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon that affects the dynamic performance of a module when it is connected to other modules. To address this issue, scientists have developed an analysis framework that explicitly accounts for retroactivity in gene transcription networks. This framework involves three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which quantify the effects of intramodular and intermodular connections on a module's dynamics. These matrices can be computed from macroscopic parameters, such as dissociation constants and promoter concentrations, and from the modules' topology. By using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, researchers can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. The study also provides a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be used to assess the extent of modularity in natural networks and to design guidelines for minimizing retroactivity in synthetic systems. The research demonstrates that accounting for retroactivity reveals surprising dynamical properties of modules and can aid in their design.
Researchers have investigated recombination in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) of the human X and Y chromosomes, a region essential for proper chromosome disjunction during male meiosis. The PAR1 region has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average, due to an obligatory crossover. However, the mechanism behind this high crossover rate and the fine-scale positioning of crossovers in this region were unknown. To address this, researchers constructed a fine-scale genetic map of PAR1 using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates inferred from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified direct PRDM9 binding sites in human cells using ChIP-seq. The results showed that, unlike in mice, PRDM9 localizes peaks of recombination in human PAR1. Recombination was found to be a rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1, with hotspot activities differing significantly among human populations. Additionally, the researchers found evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between humans and chimpanzees, with no sharing among the hottest hotspots. The study suggests that PRDM9 remains responsible for positioning recombination events in humans, but other factors may aid this protein in producing a high overall crossover rate. The genetic maps built and validated in this work are expected to aid research on this vital region of the genome.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A, called ΔN-JMJD2A, which plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. This process involves the transformation of muscle precursor cells, called myoblasts, into mature muscle cells, called myotubes. The study found that ΔN-JMJD2A is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. In contrast to the full-length JMJD2A protein, ΔN-JMJD2A does not have a demethylase domain, but it still promotes the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the promoter of the myogenic factor myogenin (Myog). This leads to the activation of Myog expression and the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression. Genome-wide expression profiling and siRNA knockdown experiments confirmed that ΔN-JMJD2A is essential for muscle differentiation. The study also showed that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and is recruited to the Myog promoter at the onset of differentiation. This binding is linked to the demethylation of histone H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, which are repressive chromatin marks. The researchers conclude that the induction of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation, as it promotes the removal of repressive chromatin marks and allows for the activation of muscle-specific genes.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 reported cases in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. A study analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end game, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is high. The study estimated the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986 to 2030 and compared it to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing and control (surveillance and outbreak response). The GWEP cost an estimated $11 (95% uncertainty interval, $4.70-$12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing was estimated at $222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. The study found that the GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by 2030 and is certainly more cost-effective if the willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of Guinea worm disease exceeds $0.10. Even if economic costs are twice as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020, the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing. The study suggests that finishing the end game, including certification of the absence of transmission, is cost-effective when framed in terms of the number of years of life lived without the risk of Guinea worm disease.
Researchers studied the protein BBK32 from the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. They found that the carboxy-terminal domain of BBK32, called BBK32-C, binds to and inhibits the C1r protein, a key component of the human complement system. The complement system is a part of the immune system that helps fight infections. The researchers also studied BBK32 orthologues, or similar proteins, from other species of Borrelia bacteria, including B. afzelii and B. garinii. They found that the BBK32 orthologues from B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi had similar activities to BBK32-C, but the orthologue from B. garinii had reduced activity. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of BBK32-C and found that it has an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the core. They also identified three surface-exposed residues that are important for binding to C1r. The structure-function studies showed that BBK32-C only recognizes the serine protease domain of C1r. These findings improve our understanding of how BBK32 recognizes and inhibits C1r and provide new insights into the complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme disease spirochetes. The results suggest that BBK32-mediated complement evasion activity is shared across major species of Lyme disease-associated spirochetes.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, undergoes significant changes in morphology and gene expression as it transitions from a commensal to a pathogenic state. While previous studies have identified several factors involved in this transformation, the regulatory mechanisms controlling this switch remain unclear. Researchers investigated the role of post-translational phosphorylation in morphogenetic control, focusing on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. They discovered that the Fkh2 transcription factor is a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. Fkh2 undergoes a radical shift in its phosphorylation profile upon hyphal induction, mediated by Cdc28 and Cbk1. This shift activates Fkh2 to promote the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis. The researchers also identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. This study reveals a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
Researchers have investigated the role of pyrimidine salvage enzymes in the human pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis. The study found that thymidine kinase (TK), an enzyme involved in the salvage pathway, is essential for the parasite's growth and infectivity in a mouse model. This is surprising because the parasite also has a de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis, which is thought to be redundant with the salvage pathway. The researchers also discovered that the parasite lacks an enzyme called dCMP deaminase, which is present in humans and provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. To compensate for the lack of dCMP deaminase, the parasite relies on TK to produce dUMP and dTMP. Depletion of TK led to a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides, suggesting the presence of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides. The study also found that knockout of cytidine deaminase, which converts deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine, led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy. These findings suggest that TK is essential for the synthesis of thymine nucleotides in T. brucei, regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage. This discovery may provide a unique opportunity to target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug.
Scientists have long understood that a specific sequence of nucleotides, known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is necessary for ribosomes to bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) and initiate protein synthesis in prokaryotic cells. However, a significant number of genes lack this sequence, raising questions about how translation initiation occurs in these mRNAs. Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of various prokaryotic genomes and found that mRNAs without Shine-Dalgarno sequences tend to have less secondary structure in their translation initiation region, particularly at the start codon. This suggests that the absence of secondary structure, rather than specific sequence motifs, is crucial for ribosomes to recognize the start codon and initiate translation.

Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, the researchers demonstrated that local RNA unfoldedness is necessary and sufficient for translation initiation in the absence of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. They also found that AUG start codons are typically located in single-stranded regions of the mRNA, while internal AUG codons are often found in structured regions. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site. The study reveals that a significant proportion of genes in various prokaryotic systems, including bacteria and mitochondria, are translated in a Shine-Dalgarno-independent manner, with the extent of this phenomenon varying between different groups of organisms.
A study in Bihar, India, investigated the occurrence of Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in patients treated with 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). PKDL is a skin disorder that can occur in up to 10% of patients treated for VL in India. Between 2007 and 2012, 8,311 patients received Ambisome as first-line treatment for VL, with a high cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Of these patients, 24 (0.3%) developed PKDL, with 89% presenting with macular lesions. The median time to developing PKDL was 1.2 years after treatment. The study found no significant risk factors for developing PKDL in patients treated with Ambisome. However, the time to developing PKDL was shorter in patients treated with Ambisome compared to those treated with conventional VL treatments. The study suggests that PKDL following treatment with 20 mg/kg Ambisome is infrequent, with no predictive risk factors identified. The shorter median time to developing symptoms of PKDL compared to conventional treatments should be considered when counseling patients treated with Ambisome. This study highlights the importance of educating patients about the possibility of PKDL and monitoring outcomes in the Indian context.
Researchers studied the re-establishment of Chagas disease vectors, specifically Triatoma infestans, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous- and discrete-time models to analyze the dynamics of re-infestation and found a 6-month time lag between detection of a new infestation and dispersal events. The models showed that more new bug populations became established from May to November than from November to May, coinciding with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with increasing time since the last detected infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge.

The researchers used two types of models, discrete- and continuous-time Markov models, to fit spatiotemporal population data of T. infestans. Both models showed a strong seasonality in bug establishment on new sites, coinciding with seasonality in dispersal distance. The study addressed three aspects relevant for population control of T. infestans: the establishment rate of new local populations as a function of distance from existing local populations, possible mechanisms for the observed seasonality in bug establishment, and the effect of insecticide spraying and previous infestation on establishment rates. The results suggest that properties of individual target sites, such as their distance from source sites, infestation history, and spraying history, contribute to their rate of bug establishment. Understanding the seasonality of bug dispersal intensity and distance is crucial for optimizing the timing of vector control.
Researchers investigated the effects of viral microRNA on the pathogenesis of polyomavirus SV40 infections in Syrian golden hamsters. The study found that SV40 displayed a broad tissue tropism, infecting liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain tissues, with the kidney being the preferred site for long-term persistent infection. The virus was detected in these tissues for up to 270 days post-infection, with liver and kidney containing higher viral DNA loads than other tissues.

Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues, and microRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney.

The study also found that infectious virus was detected infrequently, and there was limited evidence of increased clearance of microRNA-deficient viruses. However, wild-type and microRNA-negative mutants of SV40 showed similar rates of transformation of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo. The study provides the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo and suggests that viral microRNA dampens viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions.
Researchers conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide scan for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset allowed for improved statistical power and the application of new lineage- and clade-specific tests. Out of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, as well as more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and non-selection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs were found to be expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast were significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment of PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
Researchers have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms that promotes their integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers are composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). PSMs were previously thought to disassemble biofilms, but this study shows that when they aggregate into amyloid-like fibers, they stabilize biofilms instead. The researchers found that mutants unable to produce PSMs were more susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. In contrast, soluble PSM peptides dispersed biofilms, while polymerized peptides did not. The study suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. This is the first report to identify and characterize extracellular fimbriae in S. aureus biofilms. The findings demonstrate that S. aureus PSMs can be found in biofilms as fibrils and may implicate fibril formation as a means of altering their activity and function. The researchers also showed that synthetic S. aureus PSM peptides can self-assemble into amyloid-like fibers in vitro, which have characteristics similar to known amyloid proteins.
Researchers have developed a new method to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in infected individuals. Chagas disease affects over 6 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America, and is considered one of the 17 neglected illnesses by the World Health Organization. Current methods to monitor the disease, such as PCR testing, have limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood.

A new antibody profiling assay was designed to assess parasite persistence based on the waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. The assay evaluated antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients and identified a specific antibody response, Ab3, that strongly correlated with T. cruzi parasite persistence. High and sustained Ab3 signals were associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while a significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in patients who cleared parasitemia after treatment with benznidazole.

Ab3 is proposed as a new surrogate biomarker for parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. The researchers hypothesize that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. A simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe joint and muscle pain, often leading to chronic musculoskeletal pain in a significant proportion of patients. Despite its debilitating effects, the mechanism of chronic CHIKV pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Researchers have been searching for the cells responsible for the persistence of viral RNA in musculoskeletal tissues, which is thought to contribute to chronic disease. To identify these cells, scientists created a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre), which permanently marks infected cells in reporter mice. The study found that CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre infects and replicates in myoblasts and fibroblasts, leading to acute arthritis in mice. Importantly, it also induces chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis, similar to the wild-type virus. Using a tdTomato reporter mouse system, researchers identified a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days, predominantly consisting of myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. These cells were found to harbor most of the persistent CHIKV RNA at chronic time points. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells and diminished the levels of chronic viral RNA, implicating these cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. The CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system provides a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
Researchers applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how neural population activity contributes to brain function. However, it was unclear how these results generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, or how they relate to the underlying network structure. To address these questions, the study used factor analysis on recordings from the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking network models that mimic irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. The researchers compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction - shared dimensionality and percent shared variance - with neuron and trial count. They found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. The study also found that recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and relate these outputs to the underlying network structure. The results suggest that factor analysis provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial population activity than principal component analysis.
Researchers have discovered that the volatile molecule 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plays a crucial role in modulating the host's immune response to infection. In a study, mice treated with 2-AA before infection had a 90% survival rate, compared to 10% in untreated mice. The researchers found that 2-AA activates key immune response pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it also attenuates immune response activation by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The study reveals that 2-AA pretreatment leads to a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activation, while preserving the activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. This results in the activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (c/EBPβ) and the formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex, which prevents NF-κB activation. The researchers propose that 2-AA's ability to dampen inflammation while increasing host survival and pathogen persistence is due to its ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode.

This study demonstrates that 2-AA is a quorum sensing immunomodulatory signal that promotes original aspects of interkingdom communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection. Unlike other immune-suppressing QS molecules, 2-AA minimizes activation of immune effectors and increases survival of infected animals, while permitting a long-term presence of the pathogen in vivo.
Scientists have discovered that a gene called L1TD1, which is derived from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement, plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in humans. To understand how this role was acquired, researchers investigated the origin and evolution of L1TD1. They found that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. The gene has evolved under positive selection in primates and mice, suggesting that it has been selected for functional novelty, possibly for a role in genome defense. In some lineages, L1TD1 has "replenished" itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. The researchers also found that L1TD1 loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents. This suggests that L1TD1 may have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and shows that such domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages.
A highly conserved bacterial protein, YbeY, has been found to be essential for the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, playing a critical role in virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control. Unlike in Escherichia coli, where YbeY is not essential, its loss in V. cholerae severely impairs the bacterium's ability to colonize mice, form biofilms, produce cholera toxin, and regulate virulence-associated small RNAs. YbeY is an endoribonuclease that processes the 3' end of 16S rRNA, a crucial step in ribosome assembly. Depletion of YbeY in V. cholerae leads to the accumulation of 16S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits, demonstrating its importance in ribosome quality control. The study also found that YbeY is part of a core set of RNases essential in most representative pathogens, highlighting its conserved function across species. In contrast, other RNases involved in 16S rRNA processing, such as RNase G, RNase E, and RNase R, are not essential for V. cholerae. The findings suggest that YbeY plays a unique role in 16S rRNA 3' end maturation and ribosome assembly in V. cholerae, underscoring its importance in the bacterium's pathogenicity.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of human transcription factor networks (TFNs) and their robustness to genetic and environmental perturbations. They found that all 41 human cell and tissue-specific TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which is a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. This signature confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. The researchers also determined the extent to which each component of the assortativity signature contributes to this robustness. They used publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. The study suggests that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks. Theoretical work has shown that TFN models with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to mutations in cis-regulatory sites and gene duplication. This occurs because increased assortativity may either shrink the average size of nested subgraphs within the network or increase the average number of regulatory links that separate TFs, both of which tend to dampen the phenotypic effects of mutations. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the assortativity signature in the theoretical understanding of networked systems.
Researchers used a large-scale multi-electrode array to record the activity of up to 74 neurons in the anesthetized adult rat somatosensory barrel cortex in response to different whisker stimuli. They found that individual inhibitory (INH) neurons were better at distinguishing between different stimuli than excitatory (EXC) neurons in the granular and infra-granular layers. Inhibitory neuron ensembles provided as much information about the stimuli as comparable ensembles of the 20% most informative EXC neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that a group of INH neurons plays a key role in processing sensory activity in the neocortical network.

The study showed that INH neurons in the granular and infra-granular layers had a higher level of stimulus-related information than EXC neurons, indicating a sharper tuning of their responses to different stimuli. Inhibitory neuron ensembles were also found to have a lower amount of redundancy compared to EXC cell ensembles. The results suggest that INH neurons in layer 4 convey more information about stimulus location and frequency than EXC neurons due to their higher number of spikes per stimulus, higher precision, and lower adaptation at higher frequency stimulation. Overall, the study highlights the importance of inhibitory neurons in efficiently processing sensory activity in the neocortical network.
Researchers have engineered a living cell to perform a fundamental arithmetic operation, binary addition, using a system based on regulatory RNAs. This achievement demonstrates the potential of regulatory RNAs as key players in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex RNA-based biocomputers. The system, called a genetic half adder, is designed to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations and report the result as fluorescence amplitudes. The system exploits post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense molecular signals.

The genetic half adder was engineered in Escherichia coli using riboregulators of translation initiation to implement the design. The system reports the sum of the computation as red fluorescence and the carry as green fluorescence. This design is more organized and scalable than previous genetic half adders, with a reduced genetic footprint due to the use of regulatory RNAs. The use of regulatory RNAs also allows for easier computational design of de novo sequences.

This work builds on previous efforts in RNA synthetic biology, which have led to the development of combinatorial logic gates, serial cascades, feed-forward loops, and pulse counters. The genetic half adder demonstrates the potential of regulatory RNAs to perform complex computations in living cells and opens up new possibilities for the development of RNA-based biocomputers.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds that can inhibit the activity of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating the intracellular levels of nucleotides. These compounds, known as ribonucleoside phosphonates, mimic the structure of natural nucleoside 5′-monophosphates but have a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon bond instead of the labile phosphorus-oxygen bond found in natural nucleotides. By screening a library of 34 phosphonate analogues, the researchers identified six compounds that bind more tightly to cN-II than its natural substrate, inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). These compounds, which include derivatives 19, 21, 23, and 32-34, were found to induce a total inhibition of cN-II activity at a concentration of 2 mM. The binding strength of these compounds was attributed to an impressive number of van der Waals contacts with three specific residues on the cN-II protein: Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Experimental measurements confirmed the docking predictions, demonstrating that these phosphonate analogues can effectively inhibit cN-II activity. The study highlights the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in the design of new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial role of hydrophobic stacking promoted by the three protein residues. These findings have implications for the development of new cancer therapies, as high levels of cN-II expression have been linked to poor patient outcomes in cancer treatment.
A recent study has found evidence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). This is the first time prion infectivity has been detected in mammary secretions from scrapie-affected ewes. The study found consistent levels of infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep several months before clinical onset of the disease. Abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) was also detected in lacteal ducts and mammary acini of affected ewes.

The presence of PrPSc accumulation was associated with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles, which develop in response to Maedi lentivirus infection. However, bioassay revealed that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum not only from ewes with lymphoproliferative chronic mastitis but also from those with lesion-free mammary glands. Infectivity was detected in the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions of milk and colostrum.

The study used a Tg 338 mouse model to measure the infectious titre of prions in milk and colostrum. The results showed that the highest per ml infectious titre was equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. These findings suggest that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. The study raises concerns about the risk of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.
During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia from April 2014 to March 2015, a total of 10,536 individuals were identified, with 3,897 confirmed cases of EVD. Laboratory data from 16,370 samples showed significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Young children and the elderly, as well as individuals from rural areas, were found to be at higher risk of death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.

The data collection and management process was challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems, resulting in missing and duplicate data. However, EVD diagnostic laboratories were able to systematically register basic demographic and clinical information of patients. The investigation was part of the Ebola public health response in Liberia and was not considered a research on human subjects, as the data were collected for public health response purposes rather than research.

The findings of this study may contribute to a fuller understanding of the EVD outbreak in Liberia and support future investigations. The data were collected using Microsoft Excel, the Epi-Info Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Application, and the DHIS 2, and were used to identify risk factors for death due to EVD, including age and place of residence.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, an enzyme that converts phenol to ortho-quinone. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase that relies on a "caddie" protein to facilitate the transport of copper ions into its active center. A key residue in the caddie protein, Tyr98, plays a crucial role in the reaction. In a previous study, it was found that Tyr98 is converted to a reactive quinone through the formation of specific intermediates. However, the exact mechanism of this reaction remained unclear.

To shed light on this process, researchers used cryo-trapped crystal structures to determine the high-resolution structures of tyrosinase. These structures revealed a previously unknown step in the reaction mechanism: the movement of CuA, a copper ion, triggers a rearrangement of the copper ligands, allowing the hydroxyl group of the substrate to be placed in an optimal position for reaction. This rearrangement enables the electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring by the Cu2O2 oxidant.

The study also used UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopy to confirm the formation of the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper (II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. The results suggest that the binding position of the caddie Tyr98 residue may differ from that of a genuine substrate. The researchers propose a new catalytic mechanism for tyrosinase, which involves the coordination preference determined by the oxidation state of copper and the protonation state triggering the generation of reaction intermediates.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, specifically the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit precursor. The first pre-60S particle contains 30 assembly factors, including 8 RNA helicases, which drive conformational rearrangements but lack substrate specificity in vitro. The Dbp6p helicase is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S pre-ribosomal particle in yeast. A complex of four assembly factors, Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, associates with Dbp6p prior to incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p forms the backbone of this complex and directly binds to Dbp6p and Npa2p. The Npa1p complex is necessary for the stable integration of Dbp6p within the initial 90S pre-ribosomal particle and for the modulation of its enzymatic activities. Npa1p cross-links to 25S rRNA and snoRNAs involved in decoding center and peptidyl transferase center modifications. The Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions. The Npa1p/Npa2p/Nop8p/Rsa3p core complex can form and associate with 90S pre-ribosomal particles in the absence of Dbp6p, but lacks enzymatic activity.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine, in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. They used a combination of pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology, and computational modeling to study 32 participants. The study found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. This suggests that the phasic catecholamine response following surprising outcomes drives subsequent increases in learning rate. The P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of unexpectedness of an outcome and uncertainty of a preexisting belief on learning rate. Furthermore, a pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, depending on participants' baseline learning rate. These findings provide evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. The study's results support the idea that catecholamines play a crucial role in incorporating new unexpected observations into beliefs about the causal structure of the environment.
Researchers implemented a syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases. The system uses data from point-of-care (POC) laboratories to detect abnormal epidemiological events. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Saloum region of Senegal, and EPIMIC was implemented to analyze data from these labs. Over five years, 2,577 patients were tested, and 739 were found to be positive for at least one of the 15 pathogens being monitored. The system generated 443 alarms, indicating potential outbreaks or unusual disease patterns. In 2016, a third POC laboratory was established in the Niakhar region, and EPIMIC was implemented there as well. Over the next five years, 316 patients were tested, and 56 were found to be positive for at least one of the 15 pathogens. The system generated 14 alarms. The researchers found that EPIMIC was successful in detecting true epidemiological events without requiring significant human or economic resources. The system's ability to monitor 27 POC tests for 15 pathogens in near real-time is a key advantage. However, further improvements are needed to enhance the EPIMIC syndromic surveillance network. The successful implementation of EPIMIC in rural Senegal demonstrates the potential for similar initiatives to improve global knowledge of infectious diseases.
Researchers investigated how the arrangement of endothelial cells affects collective calcium signaling and cell contractility in response to external stimuli. They used a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning to study the behavior of endothelial cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks. The study found that endothelial cells in networks, but not individual cells or monolayers, exhibited calcium oscillations in response to histamine stimulation. This calcium oscillation was found to depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication. The researchers used micropatterning, pharmacological inhibition, and computational modeling to demonstrate that the calcium oscillation is a key factor in regulating cell contractility and cytoskeletal reorganization in response to histamine. The study suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms of intercellular signaling and its functional implications in diverse vascular structures.
Researchers have identified multiple antigenic sites on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G attachment protein that contribute to immunity against the virus. These sites are located outside of the central conserved and cysteine noose domains, which were previously thought to be the primary targets of the immune response. Using a recombinant E. coli-expressed G ectodomain (REG) and a CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REG ΔCCD), the researchers found that the N- and C-terminal subdomains and antigenic site peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound to fully glycosylated recombinant mammalian-expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles. However, these antibodies showed minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to the intact G ectodomain.

Vaccinated mice challenged with RSV-A2 Line 19F showed significantly reduced viral replication in the nasal cavity and lungs compared to unimmunized controls. The control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles. The researchers also found very low Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios in the lungs of REG ΔCCD vaccinated mice after challenge. These findings suggest that the identified antigenic sites outside of the central conserved and cysteine noose domains could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.
Researchers have identified a specific gene, brr2, that plays a crucial role in the development of a type of neuron in the fruit fly Drosophila. These neurons, called Tv4 neurons, produce a neuropeptide called FMRFa, which is essential for the fly's nervous system. The researchers found that brr2 is involved in controlling the expression of FMRFa specifically in the Tv4 neurons, and that it does so through two independent mechanisms. First, brr2 helps the Tv4 axon find its target tissue, which is necessary for receiving a signal that triggers the production of FMRFa. Second, brr2 regulates the splicing of two genes involved in the BMP signaling pathway, which is necessary for the Tv4 neuron to differentiate and produce FMRFa. The researchers also found that brr2 and another gene, Prp8, work together to control the expression of FMRFa in the Tv4 neurons. This study provides new insights into the role of RNA processing in the development of specific neurons in the central nervous system. The findings suggest that brr2 and Prp8 are not just general components of the spliceosome, but also play a specific role in controlling the development of Tv4 neurons. This research has implications for our understanding of how neurons develop and differentiate in the nervous system.
Researchers have identified a new pathway for regulating the abundance of F-box proteins, which are crucial components of the SCF ubiquitin ligases. These ligases play a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and are often misregulated in diseases such as cancer. The new pathway targets F-box proteins that are not bound to Skp1, a central component of the SCF complex, and involves the cullin component Cdc53/Cul1. This pathway is independent of Skp1 and relies on the SCF core components Cdc53, Rbx1, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. The study focused on the F-box protein Met30, which is a substrate adaptor for the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase, and found that its instability in Skp1 mutants led to the discovery of this new pathway. The researchers propose that the ubiquitin ligase responsible for degrading "Skp1-free" Met30 recognizes a domain adjacent to the F-box domain, which is obstructed by Skp1 binding. This pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. The findings assign important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1. This discovery expands our understanding of the regulation of F-box protein abundance and highlights the complexity of the SCF ubiquitin ligase system.
Kinesin-3 motors, such as KIF1A, play a crucial role in transporting synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. These motors are typically kept inactive in the absence of cargo to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility. Current models suggest that KIF1A motors are monomeric in the inactive state and become activated through concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. However, a recent study challenges this model by showing that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in the inactive state. This finding suggests that KIF1A motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization, but rather are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms. The study identifies the sequences and mechanisms required for dimerization and inhibition, and shows that only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. Processive motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubules, with an average velocity comparable to that of vesicles moving in vivo. The study's findings have important implications for understanding how kinesin motors are regulated to enable transport of the correct cargo to the proper cellular destination at the relevant time. The results suggest that KIF1A may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism in tomato plants. They analyzed the metabolite profiles of 76 different tomato introgression lines grown in the field over two consecutive harvest seasons. The study found that amino acid contents showed a high degree of variability across the population, while sugar levels exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), indicating that the genetic background of the plants played a significant role in determining metabolite levels.

The study also found that the seed metabolic network displayed a tighter interdependence of metabolic processes compared to the fruit metabolic network. Amino acids in the seed network played a central hub-like role, interacting with other metabolite categories such as sugars and organic acids. Six amino acids (Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro) were found to be highly co-regulated, and their interdependence was confirmed by mQTL mapping.

The study highlights the importance of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping to understand the regulation of seed metabolism. The results suggest that the genetic basis of natural variability in seed primary metabolism is complex and influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The study also found that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit, and that phenotypic plasticity was greater in the introgression lines than in the M82 tomato cultivar. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of seed metabolism and its relationship with fruit metabolism in tomato plants.
Vibrio cholerae, a bacterial pathogen, uses a protein called GbpA to colonize the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. GbpA has been shown to bind to both marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin, but the molecular mechanism behind this binding was unknown. Researchers have now determined the three-dimensional structure of GbpA and found that it has an unusual, elongated four-domain structure. Two of these domains are similar in structure to known chitin-binding modules and are responsible for binding to chitin. The other two domains have a distant structural similarity to bacterial pili-binding proteins and are involved in binding the V. cholerae surface.

The researchers used a glycan screen to show that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides, and structure-guided truncation mutants revealed that domains 1 and 4 of GbpA interact with chitin in vitro. In vivo complementation studies showed that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial binding studies demonstrated that domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Mouse virulence assays showed that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These findings explain how GbpA provides modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons. The study provides new insights into the molecular properties governing GbpA's ability to mediate interactions between the bacteria and host surfaces in both the marine environment and the mammalian host.
Researchers have identified a subset of immune cells, known as HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells, that are resistant to suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) in people with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). These cells, which are characterized by their expression of the HLA-DR protein, are found in the blood of adults with TB and are resistant to the suppressive effects of Tregs. This resistance allows the HLA-DR+ T cells to continue to activate and proliferate, contributing to the chronic inflammation seen in TB.

The researchers found that the HLA-DR+ T cells express higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IFNG, IL17A, and IL22, which can counteract the suppressive effects of Tregs. They also found that these cells are resistant to suppression mediated by the CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways, which are known to promote Treg function. By blocking these pathways, the researchers were able to restore sensitivity to suppression in the HLA-DR+ T cells.

The study suggests that the expansion of HLA-DR+ T cells may contribute to the loss of Treg-mediated homeostasis in TB, leading to chronic inflammation and disease progression. The researchers propose that HLA-DR+ T cells may serve as a functional marker of disease in TB, with implications for disease monitoring and response to therapy.
Researchers studied how prions, misfolded proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, propagate in mice with a modified version of the prion protein (PrPC) that lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. These mice, called tgGPI− mice, are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate the misfolded protein (PrPSc) outside of cells, rather than inside. The study found that two prion strains, RML and ME7, were able to propagate in tgGPI− mice, but with some unexpected results. The levels of PrPSc in the brains of infected tgGPI− mice were 25-50 times higher than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, when the prions were transferred back to wild-type mice, the ME7 prions regained their original properties, but the RML prions gave rise to a new, stable prion strain, designated SFL. This new strain remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice. The researchers propose that the high levels of PrPSc in tgGPI− mice are due to the stability of the misfolded protein outside of cells, which allows it to propagate more easily. This finding suggests that the GPI anchor plays a crucial role in the propagation of prions, and that the environment in which the misfolded protein is formed can influence its properties and behavior.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway in the development of the dorsal ectoderm in Drosophila embryos. The BMP pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning, and its activity is opposed by the EGF signaling pathway. Using a combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, the researchers identified multiple new BMP target genes, including both positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. They found that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, suggesting a self-regulating property of the BMP gene network. This balance between BMP and EGF signaling is essential for correct patterning of the dorsal ectoderm. The researchers also identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the expression domain of BMP-dependent transcription. Additionally, they found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein showed reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, which are specified by peak BMP signaling. The study provides new insights into the transcriptional network underlying dorsal ectoderm differentiation in response to BMP signaling in Drosophila embryos, and has implications for understanding BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major have been increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To better understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, researchers conducted a multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from three endemic governorates: Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid. The study analyzed isolates collected in Sidi Bouzid over two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012. The results showed that over two decades, L. major populations in the same area evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, suggesting that human activities may be the source of the disease expansion. The study also found previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts, which could be explained by human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes. The findings provide new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia, which may improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmintic chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. The study involved a cohort of 701 participants who received repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel, with and without access to WASH resources. Helminth infections were diagnosed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR.

The results showed that treatment with albendazole significantly reduced the odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth (STH) species, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.20, p < 0.001). Access to safe flooring was also found to offer some additional protection against STH infections, with an aOR of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56, p < 0.001). For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective, with an aOR of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.60, p = 0.001).

Among individuals not treated with albendazole or praziquantel, the most protective intervention package to reduce the probability of STH infections included safe flooring and latrine access. The study found no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthelmintic chemotherapy and WASH resources. The results suggest that deworming is effective in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults, and while WASH offers minimal additional benefit, it may significantly reduce infection prevalence in adults without access to chemotherapy.
Researchers have identified a bacterial toxin called LlpA, found in certain plant-associated bacteria, which selectively kills closely related species, including several phytopathogens. The crystal structure of LlpABW, a prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides, and mutational analysis shows that an intact sugar-binding pocket is crucial for bactericidal activity. In contrast, the N-terminal MMBL domain lacks a functional mannose-binding site and is structurally more divergent. Engineered N/C-domain chimeras derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra indicate that the N-domain determines target specificity. This suggests that the bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately for dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity. LlpABW is the first prokaryotic member of the MMBL lectin family, which is typically associated with eukaryotic proteins involved in general defense mechanisms. The study provides insights into the structural determinants of LlpA's activity and specificity, shedding light on the evolution of this unique bacteriocin.
Researchers have discovered a novel secretion apparatus in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis that plays a crucial role in maintaining spore integrity and developmental gene expression. During sporulation, the developing spore (forespore) resides within a mother cell, and the regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG has been poorly understood. The researchers found that eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ are required for σG activity. These proteins share similarities with components of specialized secretion systems, and one of them resembles a secretion ATPase. The researchers demonstrated that the ATPase motifs are necessary for σG activity and spore formation. They also showed that the SpoIIIA proteins and SpoIIQ form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. This complex is essential for maintaining forespore integrity, as its absence leads to large invaginations and collapse of the forespore. Notably, the maintenance of forespore integrity does not require σG activity. The researchers propose that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore, allowing the mother cell to nurture the forespore and maintain its physiology and σG activity during spore maturation. This discovery provides new insights into the complex interactions between the mother cell and forespore during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population. The study included 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls, but did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci. However, the researchers found a significant association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence for replication (P=1.5×10−7). This suggests that, in a large enough study, associations are more likely to replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship.

The study also found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. This indicates that there may be common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies. The researchers provide a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies. This approach can help identify replicable genetic signals in circumscribed regions of the genome that may not be captured by single locus analyses in a single genome-wide association study at genome-wide significance levels.
Researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms of cell proliferation, particularly in the context of cancer. A new study presents a genome-wide analysis of cancer proliferation based on gene expression and growth rate measurements of 12,690 genes across 60 cancer cell lines. The study assigns a Cancer Proliferation Index (cPI) to each gene, which quantifies its association with growth rate. The results show that genes essential for cancer cell growth have positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors have negative cPI values.

The analysis reveals that cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production processes are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated with it. A parallel analysis of non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines shows marked differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. The study identifies genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins.

A cross-species comparison reveals that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures leads to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer. The study's findings point to inherent differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants, which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease that can affect the heart and vena cava, but few cases have been reported. A 15-year retrospective study of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE found that the main symptoms were thoracic pain or dyspnea, although two patients were asymptomatic. The cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava, and nine patients had previously been diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, supplemented by serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology.

Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median duration of 25 months. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination, and two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement only did not experience complications after surgery and were considered cured, while those with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolisms and presented multiple complications.

Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications. The study suggests that CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of TirS, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) mimic in Staphylococcus aureus, in modulating virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. They found that ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection, skin lesions induced by a tirS mutant strain increased compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite similar bacterial loads. This suggests that TirS plays a central role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses. TirS was also associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity. Furthermore, TirS localized within staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, and sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increased TirS expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between TirS and clinical presentation, but showed a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS. The study suggests that TirS modulates an inflammatory response at the site of infection through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and that its expression may confer a selective advantage to S. aureus.
Researchers analyzed gene expression data from fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) embryos to understand how differences in gene expression contribute to distinct embryonic morphologies. They found that many genes have similar expression patterns in both species, but also identified clusters of genes with discordant expression profiles. One cluster contained genes specifically expressed in the mosquito's serosa, a layer of tissue that is absent in fruit flies. This cluster was also found to be reactivated later in development, during cuticle synthesis. Additionally, the researchers discovered a striking difference in the expression of maternal genes between the two species. In fruit flies, these genes are sharply reduced at the maternal-zygotic transition, while in mosquitoes, they are sustained. The study proposes a new method for identifying gene batteries underlying morphological diversity by clustering genes based on local temporal discordances in their expression profiles. This approach can be used to analyze transcriptional datasets from different species and identify functional gene sets. The study provides a framework for cross-organismal temporal alignments and comparisons of species-specific transcriptional datasets, revealing distinctive patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including the organization of extra-embryonic tissues and the maternal-zygotic transition.
Researchers conducted a study in rural villages of Papua New Guinea to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens. The study found that 21% of asymptomatic participants had detectable H. ducreyi DNA on their skin, and 1% had detectable T. p. pertenue DNA. This is the first report of asymptomatic carriage of H. ducreyi DNA on skin.

The study also found that 90% of flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA, and 50% had T. p. pertenue DNA. Additionally, 33% of bed sheets sampled had H. ducreyi DNA, and 17% had T. p. pertenue DNA. The study suggests that the ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism.

The researchers collected cultures from asymptomatic participants and found that 12% yielded a definitive diagnosis of H. ducreyi, proving skin colonization. The study also found that people from households without an ulcer case had positivity rates similar to those with an H. ducreyi ulcer case in the household.

The study's findings suggest that H. ducreyi is widespread in the environment and can be found on the skin of asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens. This has implications for the spread of the disease and highlights the need for further research into the transmission dynamics of H. ducreyi.
The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in the field. These competencies aim to address the diverse backgrounds and intended application areas of various populations in need of bioinformatics training. The core competencies were initially developed through surveys of employers and training programs, and have since been refined through a multi-year process of community engagement.

The competencies are designed to be applicable across various user personas and training programs, and are intended to facilitate the sharing of experiences and best practices in bioinformatics education. A series of use cases is presented to illustrate the application of the competencies in different bioinformatics education and training programs globally. These use cases highlight diverse training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings.

The core competencies are not intended to be a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs. The use cases demonstrate the value of the core competencies in defining, refining, or assessing bioinformatics training mechanisms. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans for the continued refinement and application of the bioinformatics core competencies.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, which infects over one billion people worldwide, to understand the mechanisms behind its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3i). Unlike other parasitic nematodes, S. stercoralis has a life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms, allowing for the investigation of L3i arrest and activation. The researchers compared S. stercoralis to the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a similar developmentally arrested larval form called the dauer. They hypothesized that homologous pathways in S. stercoralis would have similar developmental regulation and be involved in L3i arrest and activation.

To test this, the researchers conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of S. stercoralis, generating over 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. They constructed developmental expression profiles for S. stercoralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes and found that genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately up-regulated in L3i. In contrast, S. stercoralis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) ligands, which have abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3i development. The researchers also identified seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which are only expressed in L3i. However, putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. These findings suggest that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species.
Researchers have investigated the effects of bacterial genotoxins, specifically Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on nuclear remodeling in cells. These toxins are produced by pathogenic bacteria and have been linked to digestive cancers. The study used various models, including infected mice, coculture experiments, and xenograft mouse-derived models, to assess the impact of these toxins on nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that CDT and colibactin induce the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells, which correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of the NR concentrates ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the complex mCRD involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling. The formation of these structures is dynamic, transient, and protects the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. The study suggests that bacterial genotoxins-induced NR may serve as a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be transported and translated within the nucleus. These findings provide new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers, which can occur in response to genotoxic bacteria and therapies-induced DNA damage.
Researchers used three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy. Leprosy, a chronic bacterial infection, can cause facial deformities, including a "saddle nose" and regression of the maxilla, or upper jawbone. However, previous studies have only used subjective visual grading to assess maxillary changes in living patients. In this study, 3D images of the maxilla were reconstructed from CT scans of 10 former leprosy patients and 5 control subjects. The researchers measured the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA-P) and found significant atrophy in three patients with lepromatous leprosy, which corresponded with the visual appearance of maxillary deformity. These findings were consistent with previous paleopathological studies of excavated skeletal remains. The study also showed that precise bone defects of the maxilla could be calculated, allowing for accurate reconstructive surgery. The use of 3D-CT enabled easier evaluation of maxillary deformities and may become a tool for reconstructive surgery of maxillary defects caused by leprosy. This approach may also contribute to novel surgical treatments for facial deformity and help eliminate social segregation and prejudice associated with leprosy. The study's methodology represents a promising tool for the quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities associated with leprosy and other maxillary lesions.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system represents sounds in the presence of background noise. They found that neurons in the auditory pathway adapt to changes in sound statistics, such as mean and contrast, as the sound travels from the ear to the brain. This adaptation increases as the sound ascends the auditory pathway, from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex. The researchers used a decoding approach to assess the noise tolerance of the neuronal population code and found that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. However, populations that show the strongest adaptation to stimulus statistics are also the most noise-tolerant. This suggests that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain. The study found a progressive increase in the noise tolerance of population representations of sound as one progresses through the auditory pathway. By the level of the cortex, neural populations represent the signal in a more noise-tolerant fashion, responding to sound features that are common between clean and noisy conditions. This adaptation to stimulus statistics enables the brain to build noise-invariant representations of sounds, which is a major computational step towards context-invariant, categorical sound representations seen in higher areas of the auditory cortex.
Researchers studied how the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome) changes in response to heat shock, a well-characterized form of cellular stress. They used data from the BioGRID database and mRNA expression levels to calculate the weight of each protein-protein interaction in both resting and heat-shocked yeast cells. The results showed that heat shock caused a significant decrease in the overlap and connections between modules of the interactome, leading to a 4.9-fold increase in the weighted diameter of the network. Several key proteins involved in the heat shock response became centers of local communities and bridges connecting modules after heat shock. This change in the interactome structure was likened to a "stratus-cumulus" transition, where the unstressed interactome was globally connected like stratus clouds, while the heat-shocked interactome was more multifocal like cumulus clouds. The study suggests that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome, which may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes. This change may also occur in other complex systems, such as social networks and ecosystems, in response to stress or crisis.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of amiodarone in treating ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a chronic condition caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, prevalent in Latin America. The study included 9 studies, with 2 providing individual patient data for analysis. The results showed that amiodarone significantly reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular couplets in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Specifically, amiodarone reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes by 99.9%, ventricular premature beats by 93.1%, and ventricular couplets by 79%. The incidence of adverse side effects associated with amiodarone use was also reported, including corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. While amiodarone appears to be effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, there is no direct evidence for its effect on hard endpoints such as sudden death or hospitalization. The study highlights the importance of balancing the potential benefits and harms of amiodarone use in individual patients with Chagas disease.
Researchers analyzed medical records from two hospitals in rural Ecuador to study the seasonal patterns of dengue fever from 2009 to 2016. They found that dengue fever cases peaked in mid-March and were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but less likely on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. The study also examined the effect of climate on dengue fever diagnoses and found that monthly total precipitation, interactions between precipitation and temperature, and interactions between precipitation and precipitation days were significant predictors of dengue fever cases. This study is one of the first to report long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador and provides valuable information for local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
Researchers have discovered a new way to boost the body's innate immune system to fight off viral infections without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. They found that expressing a protein called RdRP, which is part of a virus's replication machinery, can activate the innate immune system to produce a robust antiviral response. This response involves the production of type I interferons and a large class of antiviral factors called ISGs. The researchers created mice that expressed RdRP and found that they had a maximally upregulated innate immune transcriptome, which allowed them to resist normally lethal viral challenges. The mice showed a 5-log reduction in viral transcript loads and survived lethal viral infections. The researchers also found that the RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism operates independently of the adaptive immune system and does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA, but rather on the protein level and RdRP catalysis. Importantly, the mice remained healthy and had normal longevity despite lifelong massive ISG elevations. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection. The findings suggest that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant RNA virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), to determine if the effective population size (Ne) is dose-dependent. The IAH states that each virion has a probability of infection and acts independently of other virions during the infection process. The study used TEV variants carrying fluorescent markers to infect Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants at different doses. The results showed that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency.

The study found that the probability of a genotype infecting a plant systemically was near 1, but in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted using the independent-action model. The results suggest that the IAH holds for TEV, and Ne is dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The study also found that the mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, approaching 1 at low doses.

The findings have implications for experimental evolution with plant viruses, as Ne can be extremely small and genetic drift can have a significant impact on virus populations. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering dose effects when comparing Ne estimates for different viruses. The independent-action model may apply to many mono-partite plant viruses, but further experiments are needed to confirm this.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach to study the genetic control of gene expression across multiple tissues. This approach, called Sparse Bayesian Regression, allows for the simultaneous analysis of gene expression in multiple tissues and the identification of genetic variants that influence gene expression. The method was tested on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues and was found to be more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the complexity of the genetic control of gene expression.

The new method, combined with an efficient computational algorithm called Evolutionary Stochastic Search, was able to uncover polygenic regulation of gene expression and identify secondary trans-eQTLs that were not detected by traditional methods. The approach also allowed for the identification of genetic regulation across multiple tissue types, with approximately 27% of transcripts showing common genetic regulation across four tissues. This led to a greater than 5-fold increase in the detection of eQTLs compared to single-tissue analyses at a 5% false discovery rate.

The researchers demonstrated the power of their method by identifying a two-eQTL model for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and not detected by conventional approaches. The new approach provides a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression, and its generality makes it adaptable to other model systems and humans, with broad application to the analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the process of extrinsic apoptosis, a type of cell death triggered by external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. The model is based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways and was trained using experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. The model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, allowing for a detailed study of the switching mechanisms involved in extrinsic apoptosis.

The model reveals that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by the activity of initiator caspase-8 and the rates of other reactions downstream of the TRAIL receptor. The sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved through reactions involved in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the relocalization of proteins such as Smac. The interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are critical for snap-action control.

Previous kinetic models of apoptotic cell death have focused on achieving all-or-none caspase activation through positive feedback or ultra-sensitivity. In contrast, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway exhibits a "variable-delay, snap-action" switching behavior, characterized by a long and variable delay prior to effector caspase activation followed by rapid and sudden progression to substrate cleavage. This behavior is critical for enforcing an unambiguous choice between life and death in cells.
Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can infect the placenta during pregnancy, posing a risk to the fetus. To understand how this bacterium breaches the placental barrier, researchers have been studying the protein Internalin P (InlP), which is secreted by Listeria monocytogenes. InlP has been identified as a critical virulence factor in placental infection. The study found that InlP binds to a human protein called afadin, which is associated with cell-cell junctions. This interaction is unique to InlP, as another similar protein, Lmo2027, does not bind to afadin. A crystal structure of InlP revealed a distinctive feature, an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a Ca2+-binding site. The researchers observed that cells expressing InlP had reduced ability to exert traction stresses on deformable substrates, similar to cells lacking afadin. Listeria monocytogenes mutants lacking InlP were unable to form actin-rich protrusions necessary for crossing the epithelial monolayer, a process called transcytosis. A similar phenotype was observed in bacteria expressing an internal deletion in InlP that disrupts its interaction with afadin. However, deleting afadin in host cells did not rescue the transcytosis defect. These findings suggest that InlP targets cytosolic afadin to promote Listeria monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection.
Researchers have characterized the proteome of Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, using mass spectrometry techniques. The study aimed to gain insights into the pathogenicity and protein expression profiles of the bacterium during infection. The researchers analyzed T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits using multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap) tandem mass spectrometry.

A total of 6033 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique T. pallidum proteins at a high level of confidence, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. The detected proteins were characterized according to their predicted biological function and localization, with half allocated into a wide range of functional categories. Proteins annotated as potential membrane proteins and those with unclear functional annotations were subjected to additional bioinformatics pipeline analysis to facilitate further characterization.

The study identified 116 potential membrane proteins, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. The researchers also found 8 proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods, and a low correlation was found between previous microarray signal data and protein abundance. The study provides valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotic cells. cAMP binds to two tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and CBD-B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). Research has shown that CBD-A is required for PKA inhibition and activation, while CBD-B acts as a "gatekeeper" domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of the two-domain construct RIα (91-379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms revealed a double conformational selection model. This model suggests that each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. The binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, selectively stabilizing the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts.

The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection but is indispensable for full activation of PKA, as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. The two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics. These findings provide new insights into the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA and the role of CBD-B in modulating the control exerted by CBD-A.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in regulating mitochondrial function in macrophages infected with vaccinia virus (VACV). They compared the proteomes of ISG15-deficient (ISG15-/-) and ISG15-sufficient (ISG15+/+) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after VACV infection. The results showed that ISG15 plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitophagy. ISG15-/- BMDM exhibited impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to ISG15+/+ BMDM after interferon (IFN) treatment. Additionally, ISG15-/- macrophages showed altered macrophage polarization, with a pro-inflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, but impaired nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation. As a result, ISG15-/- macrophages were more permissive to VACV replication after IFN treatment. The study demonstrates that ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and antiviral immunity. The findings suggest that ISG15 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial OXPHOS, mitophagy, and macrophage polarization, highlighting its importance in antiviral defense mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the HIV-1 protein Vpu regulates its own degradation and affects the release of viral particles. Vpu has two known functions: degrading the cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. It achieves this by binding CD4 and recruiting the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. However, Vpu escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP's natural targets, such as β-catenin and IκBα.

A novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, was found to be crucial for its degradation. When Vpu is phosphorylated at this site, it undergoes degradation through a βTrCP-independent pathway. This process is conserved across different HIV-1 isolates, despite its negative effect on virion release. Mutating the serine 61 residue in the HIV-1 provirus extended the half-life of Vpu and increased the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells.

The study highlights a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant suggests a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. This research provides new insights into the regulation of Vpu and its impact on HIV-1 replication.
Researchers investigated how the development of individual tissues, such as the wing, is coordinated with the overall development of the body in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. They proposed two hypotheses: that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time, or that it aligns at specific developmental milestones. To test these hypotheses, the researchers developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae based on the expression of key patterning genes. This scheme was linked to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation.

The study found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these events represent developmental milestones. However, between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. The researchers also found that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone.

The study's findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. The research provides new insights into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole, and highlights the importance of developmental milestones in ensuring the robustness of the adult phenotype.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, early endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the relationship between these two processes is not well understood. Researchers have discovered that the ESCRT regulator Did2 is essential for maintaining the balance between endocytic trafficking and long-distance transport in fungal hyphae of Ustilago maydis. Loss of Did2 leads to defective vacuolar targeting, reduced processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, explaining the disturbed processive movement. Furthermore, the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The study reveals that Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes, providing the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. This research highlights the importance of the ESCRT regulator Did2 in maintaining the balance between endocytic trafficking and long-distance transport in highly polarized cells.
Researchers compared two types of adenine riboswitches found in bacteria, one that regulates gene expression at the transcriptional level and another that regulates it at the translational level. These riboswitches bind to the molecule adenine, but they differ in how they control gene expression. The adenine riboswitch in Bacillus subtilis controls transcription, while the one in Vibrio vulnificus controls translation. The study found that these riboswitches have distinct properties and operate under different regulatory mechanisms. The Bacillus subtilis riboswitch requires adenine binding during transcription to function, whereas the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is complete and still regulate translation. The study also found that the rate of transcription is crucial for the Bacillus subtilis riboswitch to function efficiently. In contrast, the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch can regulate translation even when transcription and translation are uncoupled. The results suggest that the type of gene regulation, whether transcriptional or translational, plays a significant role in the mechanisms of riboswitches. This study highlights the complexity and diversity of riboswitch regulatory mechanisms, which can vary depending on the specific type of riboswitch and the organism in which it is found.
Researchers have discovered a common pattern of gene expression in two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. This pattern, called primer-dependent initiation (PDI), involves the use of a short RNA molecule, or primer, to start the process of gene expression. The study found that PDI occurs mainly during the stationary phase of growth, when the bacteria are not actively dividing, and is not detected during the exponential phase of growth, when the bacteria are actively dividing.

The researchers used a technique called 5' RNA-seq to analyze the RNA molecules produced by the bacteria and found that PDI is preferentially apparent at specific sequences, T-1A+1 and G-1G+1, at the start of genes. They also found that PDI produces full-length transcripts that begin with the sequences 5'-UA and 5'-GG.

The study suggests that PDI plays a role in regulating biofilm formation in E. coli and may be a widespread phenomenon in bacteria. The researchers propose that a growth phase-dependent process generates the primers used in PDI, leading to the preferential production of 5'-UA and 5'-GG oligoribonucleotides in both E. coli and V. cholerae. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of gene expression in bacteria and suggests that PDI may be an important regulatory mechanism in many types of bacteria.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis plants. Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed by a single parental allele, and their expression is crucial for embryo growth and development. In mammals and plants, parental genome imbalance has been shown to deregulate embryo growth and may contribute to reproductive isolation between emerging new species. The study focused on four imprinted genes in Arabidopsis: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2), FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA), MEDEA (MEA), and PHERES1 (PHE1). The researchers found that parental genome imbalance deregulated the expression of FIS2 and PHE1 in an antagonistic manner, meaning that an increased dosage of maternal genomes repressed growth, while an increased dosage of paternal genomes had the opposite effect. The study also showed that increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and MEA. However, the changes in PHE1 and MEA expression could not be fully accounted for by the corresponding fluctuations of FIS2 expression. The results suggest that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms that are independent of known regulators of imprinting, and the complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance does not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the biophysical mechanisms behind brain rhythms and neuronal synchronization. However, the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. This study focuses on what brain rhythms reveal about functional brain connectivity, rather than how they emerge or if they are necessary for neural function. The researchers used mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves. These reconstructed networks display similar topological features and dynamics, suggesting that brain rhythms convey information about functional connectivity. The study also reconstructed networks for diseased brains, such as those with epilepsy and schizophrenia, and found consistent alterations in functional connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, as quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with diseased brains displaying lower complexity. This suggests that brain rhythms can provide insights into the neurobiology of health and disease. The study demonstrates that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys significant information about the functional connectivity of the brain, and that this information can be used to reconstruct virtual brains that mimic the dynamics of actual brains.
Researchers analyzed genetic data from over 1,300 Hispanic individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to understand the population structure of Hispanics in the United States. They used genetic markers, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify the ancestral origins of the participants. The study found that the first two genetic components (PCs) indicated a mix of Caucasian, African, and Native American ancestry, while the third and fourth PCs revealed a geographic gradient from South to North in the Native American samples. The researchers then used a clustering method to identify four distinct subgroups within the Hispanic cohort: primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican.

To demonstrate the importance of considering population substructure in genetic studies, the researchers conducted an association analysis of triglyceride levels in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions. These genes had previously been linked to triglyceride levels in Caucasian populations, but not in Hispanic populations. The study found statistically significant evidence of genetic association in both genes, highlighting the need to account for population substructure in genetic studies of Hispanic populations. The study's findings have implications for the analysis of genetic data in Hispanic cohorts and demonstrate the importance of considering the complex genetic diversity within this population.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the Elongator complex in maintaining genome stability and regulating transcriptional silencing in cells. The Elongator complex, composed of six subunits, interacts with the protein PCNA, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. In the absence of the Elongator complex's catalytic subunit, Elp3, cells show reduced silencing of certain genes and increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. This suggests that the Elongator complex plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability.

Studies have shown that the Elongator complex functions independently of other histone chaperones, such as Asf1 and CAF-1, which are involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. The Elongator complex also interacts with the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109, which acetylates histone H3 lysine 56. This modification is essential for the assembly of new histones onto replicating DNA.

The Elongator complex's interaction with PCNA is critical for its function, as mutations in PCNA or the Elongator complex lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, the Elongator complex is required for S-phase progression in the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. These findings highlight the importance of the Elongator complex in maintaining genome stability and regulating transcriptional silencing, and its role in a pathway linked to DNA replication and repair.
Researchers have developed a machine-learning assisted method to improve the process of curating biomedical knowledge from publications. This process, known as document triage, typically involves querying and reading articles in PubMed, but often yields unsatisfactory results. The new method uses deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and rank new publications for curation. The models were trained on previously curated publications from two databases, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. The trained models were then applied to the real-world manual curation process of these databases. The results showed that the machine-assisted triage method outperformed current query-based methods, improving efficiency and enriching curated content. The method achieved a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The method also retrieved many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. The machine learning-based method has been implemented in production, allowing human curators to focus on more challenging tasks and improve the quality of knowledge bases. The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to speed up the real-world triage process for biomedical literature.
Researchers investigated the link between genetic mutations in the KCNJ2 gene and atrial arrhythmias, specifically short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3), which is associated with atrial fibrillation. The study used computer models of the human atria to simulate the effects of two specific mutations, D172N and E299V, on the heart's electrical activity. The models showed that both mutations shortened the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats, making it more susceptible to arrhythmias. The D172N mutation reduced the time it takes for the heart to recover, while the E299V mutation had a more complex effect on the heart's electrical activity. The study also found that blocking certain ion channels, specifically IK1 and IKr, was effective in terminating arrhythmias associated with the D172N mutation, while blocking IKr alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Additionally, combining the block of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias in SQT3 and suggest potential pharmacological strategies for managing the condition. The study highlights the importance of considering the complex interactions between genetic mutations and the heart's electrical heterogeneities in understanding and treating atrial arrhythmias.
Researchers investigated whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can prevent cardiac damage in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a complex condition endemic in Central and South America, with increasing cases in non-vectorial forms in developed countries. The study found that injecting ASC into mice three days after infection significantly reduced blood parasitemia, inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis in the heart at 30 days post-infection. The ASC-treated mice also showed an anti-inflammatory response in the heart and higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the spleen. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the right ventricle was protected from dilation in ASC-treated mice at 60 days post-infection. The study suggests that ASC can prevent right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, promoting the control of parasite burden and protecting the heart from damage. The findings indicate that ASC may be a potential therapeutic approach for Chagas disease, particularly when used in combination with antitrypanosomal drugs to target both parasite persistence and heart tissue inflammation. The study provides new insights into the role of ASC in modulating immune responses and preventing cardiac damage in Chagas disease.
Researchers have identified two new compounds, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, that are more effective than the existing compound Retro-2cycl in limiting Leishmania infections in mammalian cells. Leishmania parasites reside in specialized compartments called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) within infected cells. Previous studies have shown that Retro-2, a retrograde pathway inhibitor, can reduce LPV sizes and lower parasite numbers during Leishmania infections. The new compounds, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, were found to be more potent than Retro-2cycl in inhibiting Leishmania infections in macrophages, with EC50 values of 13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57+/-2.66μM, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the EC50 of Retro-2cycl, which was 40.15μM. The new compounds also caused a reversal in Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Furthermore, unlike Retro-2cycl, which is Leishmania-static, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1 can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures. This is a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections. The results validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl, suggesting that the new compounds may be effective in treating Leishmania infections.
Researchers have developed a computational method to predict which transcription factors are sensitive to nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, in the genome. They applied this method to the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor, which regulates immune gene expression. The analysis revealed that AML-1a binding sites are preferentially located within nucleosome boundaries and lack a 10-base pair periodicity, suggesting that AML-1a is sensitive to nucleosomal regulation.

The researchers confirmed this prediction in a cell line that naturally expresses the Ly49 gene family, which is regulated by AML-1a. Using a technique called MNase-Seq, they generated a map of nucleosome positions on chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene family is located. The analysis showed that nucleosomes are depleted at AML-1a binding sites in expressed Ly49 genes compared to silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes.

The study also found that many other transcription factors display similar characteristics to AML-1a, suggesting that they may also be sensitive to nucleosome regulation on a genome-wide scale. The researchers propose that this method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in understanding the regulatory role of nucleosomes in gene expression. Further studies are needed to determine whether AML-1a's sensitivity to nucleosomes is specific to Ly49 regulation or a more general phenomenon.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in orchestrating cell cycle progression, including genome duplication. The activation of CDKs depends on the phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the activation of CDK4, a master integrator of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades, is determined by the highly regulated T-loop phosphorylation at T172. Researchers used a chemical-genetics approach to investigate the role of CDK7 in CDK4 activation. They found that CDK7 inhibition prevented the activating phosphorylation of CDK4, but this effect was partly dependent on the binding of CDK4 to p21cip1. The phosphorylation of p21 at S130, catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2, also played a crucial role in CDK4 activation. The study revealed a novel CDK7-dependent positive feedback loop mediated by p21 phosphorylation to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage. The findings suggest that CDK7 has a crucial but partly indirect role in the phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6, and that there are CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7. The study provides new insights into the regulation of CDK4 and CDK6 and their role in cell cycle progression.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/MMD1 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during male meiosis in plants, specifically in the model organism Arabidopsis. Meiosis is a critical process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction. DUET/MMD1 is a PHD finger protein that binds to a specific histone modification, H3K4me2, which is essential for its function during meiosis. The study found that DUET/MMD1 is required for proper microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis, particularly during the diplotene stage of prophase I. The researchers also identified two genes, TDM1 and JAS, as targets of DUET/MMD1, with TDM1 being a direct target. TDM1 is required for meiotic cell cycle transitions, and its expression is directly dependent on DUET/MMD1. The study suggests that DUET/MMD1 functions as a transcriptional activator of the meiotic gene TDM1. Furthermore, the researchers found that DUET/MMD1 expression is stage-specific, confined to the diplotene stage, and is not detected in female meiosis. This study provides new insights into the regulation of meiotic gene expression in plants and highlights the importance of DUET/MMD1 in specifying distinct male and female meiotic programs. The findings also suggest a developmental function for H3K4me2 in Arabidopsis male reproduction.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. Previous studies have shown that these repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that proteins such as Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate this process. Researchers used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with Pur α and found over 100 proteins, including Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase. Rm62 physically interacts with Pur α and can modulate rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration. However, fragile X premutation rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 post-transcriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This accumulation is likely due to impaired nuclear export of these mRNAs. The researchers found that the expression of fragile X premutation rCGG repeats significantly reduced the viability of Rm62 mutant flies, suggesting a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death. The study suggests that the nuclear accumulation of these mRNAs may contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis by interfering with the neurons' ability to produce sufficient proteins to respond to cellular stress. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FXTAS and highlight the potential role of Rm62 in modulating rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms, has been studied to understand the development of its extracellular matrix. The matrix, composed of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins, plays a crucial role in holding bacterial cells together. Researchers have directly visualized the product of the polysaccharide synthesis locus (Psl exopolysaccharide) at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and assembly of a matrix. This matrix holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. Chemical dissociation of Psl from the bacterial surface disrupted the Psl matrix and the biofilm structure. During biofilm maturation, Psl accumulates on the periphery of 3-D-structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl matrix-free cavity in the microcolony center. At the dispersion stage, swimming cells appear in this matrix cavity, and dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated in the Psl matrix-free area. Deletion of genes that control cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion. These findings provide a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and subsequently a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal. The study reveals that Psl is a key scaffolding matrix component and opens up avenues for therapeutics of biofilm-related complications.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies, and new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are promising tools for identifying new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. To be effective, these preclinical disease models must recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. A comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO, was conducted. A pipeline was developed to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. The study found that tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlighted previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. The study also found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes, but ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Overall, the study highlights that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic factors contributing to breast cancer in East-Asian women. The study included 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls from China, Korea, and Japan. After analyzing over 690,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the researchers identified a novel susceptibility locus represented by SNP rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1. This SNP showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The adjusted odds ratios for the A/G and A/A genotypes were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86), respectively, compared to the G/G genotype. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively, also showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in each of the four stages. These findings provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 and identify two possible susceptibility loci in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3. The study contributes to the understanding of genetic factors contributing to breast cancer in East-Asian women and highlights the importance of further research to identify additional susceptibility loci.
Researchers studied 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa with cryptococcal meningitis, a major cause of mortality in the developing world. They used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and in vitro phenotypic virulence assays to analyze the genetic diversity and virulence of the isolates. The study found high levels of genetic diversity among the isolates, with 50 different sequence types identified, including 18 novel types. The isolates were grouped into three main molecular types: VNI, VNII, and VNB.

The researchers found that the VNB lineage was associated with significantly worse survival rates, with a 3.35-fold increased risk of death compared to other lineages. This association remained significant even after adjusting for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimens. The study also found that the VNII lineage had increased laccase activity and ex vivo CSF survival, indicating increased virulence. These findings suggest that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that lineage plays a significant role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection.

The study's results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic diversity of Cryptococcus neoformans in Southern Africa, where the pathogen is a major public health concern. The findings have implications for the development of targeted treatments and prevention strategies for cryptococcal meningitis. Further research is needed to investigate how genetic diversity is structured across African environments and to assess the risks posed by different ecotypes of the pathogen.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype in Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. This discovery provides a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans and sheds light on how new signal transduction pathways may evolve. The pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans: the upstream portion from the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process, Tec1 from a filamentation pathway, and the white-specific downstream target genes from an ancestral biofilm process. The evolution of this pheromone response pathway in C. albicans may serve as a paradigm for how signal transduction pathways evolve. The researchers used an overexpression library of 107 transcription factors and mutational analyses to identify Tec1 as the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway. The white cell pheromone response pathway in C. albicans is a "young" pathway, meaning it has had insufficient time to duplicate, replace, or modify components in response to new selective pressures or changing roles, providing a unique glimpse into the evolution of a new signal transduction pathway.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC-content among 149 bacterial species, which ranges from less than 20% to more than 70%. They tested the hypothesis that this variation is due to differences in mutation patterns between bacteria. The study found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria, but not in AT-rich bacteria. This pattern was observed across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species. The researchers ruled out the possibility that this excess is due to mutation bias, as it would imply that GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. They also found that the pattern is unlikely due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. As a result, the study concludes that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, the researchers further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
Researchers have developed a new tool to help control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in Kenya. These infections, caused by hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura, are a major public health concern in the country. To guide control efforts, the researchers created maps showing the combined prevalence of STH infections across Kenya in 1989 and 2009. They used data from 106,370 individuals from 945 surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009, as well as ecological and climatic information from satellite data.

The researchers used Bayesian space-time geostatistical models to estimate the probability of STH infection prevalence exceeding 20% in different areas of the country. They found that in most areas, the prevalence was below the 20% threshold in 2009, but there were areas around Lake Victoria and the coast where the prevalence was higher. By comparing the maps for 1989 and 2009, the researchers observed a gradual decrease in STH prevalence over time.

The model estimated that approximately 2.8 million school-age children live in districts that require mass treatment. The researchers suggest that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas with high STH prevalence, warranting mass treatment. This tool can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control as control efforts are successful in reducing infection levels.
Researchers investigated the role of innate immune cells, specifically invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They found that iNKT cells can recognize Mtb-infected macrophages and produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a cytokine that activates macrophages and helps control bacterial replication. This innate control of bacterial replication is dependent on CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, which require CD1d expression by infected macrophages and the presence of IL-12 and IL-18 to be activated. The researchers also showed that even small numbers of iNKT cells are sufficient to restrict Mtb replication. To determine if iNKT cells contribute to host defense against tuberculosis in vivo, the researchers adoptively transferred iNKT cells into mice infected with virulent Mtb. They found that primary splenic iNKT cells from uninfected mice significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice. This is the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. The study suggests that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide.
Researchers have investigated the process of protein cross-linking in Bacillus subtilis endospores, which are highly resilient cells surrounded by a complex protein coat. The protein coat is stabilized by covalent bonds formed by a transglutaminase enzyme called Tgl. Unlike other transglutaminases, Tgl is produced in an active form, raising questions about how its activity is controlled during spore coat assembly.

The study found that the substrates assembled onto the spore coat before Tgl production determine its localization to the surface of the developing spore. The researchers identified specific docking sites on the substrates that are crucial for Tgl's localization. They also showed that Tgl becomes part of the cross-linked products during the reaction, suggesting that it "spotwelds" pre-formed assemblies together.

The study suggests that the dependency of Tgl on its substrates is used to control the time, location, and extent of its activity. This ensures that pre-assembled complexes are cross-linked at the spore surface. The researchers propose that this mechanism is essential for proper temporal and spatial control of spore coat protein cross-linking, as well as specificity and the extent of Tgl's action. This mechanism may also apply to Tgl orthologues in other spore-forming bacteria. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of protein cross-linking in Bacillus subtilis endospores and highlights the importance of substrate-dependent localization in controlling enzyme activity.
A study conducted in southern Lao PDR aimed to map the distribution of Opisthorchis viverrini, a food-borne trematode species that causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, and identify underlying risk factors. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was carried out in 51 villages in Champasack province in 2007. The study found that 61.1% of 3,371 participants were infected with O. viverrini. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation, and unsafe drinking water source as risk factors for infection, while history of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors, with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. The study presents the first risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which is essential for spatial targeting of control efforts. The findings suggest that infection with O. viverrini is strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior, and culture, while high transmission is sustained by the lack of sanitation. The study highlights the importance of environmental factors in predicting O. viverrini prevalence and emphasizes the need for urgent public health interventions to address the high prevalence of O. viverrini infection in the region.
In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, drains play a significant role in the larval development of mosquitoes that transmit lymphatic filariasis and malaria. The city's extensive drain network, often with inadequate water flow and blocked by waste, creates an ideal breeding ground for Anopheles and Culex larvae. A study analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program and a 2006 drain survey to identify the importance of drains as larval habitats. The results showed that over 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are human-made, with drains being the most common type, accounting for 42% of all aquatic habitats. Drains with stagnant water were found to have a significantly higher presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae compared to those with flowing water. Vegetation was also found to be positively associated with the presence of mosquito larvae. The study suggests that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate over 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats currently treated with larvicides. The findings highlight the importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts for these diseases.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid-related metabolites in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells, which are associated with the formation of replicative complexes. Research has shown that DENV infection inhibits the phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, resulting in a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment that favors viral replication. This study found that DENV infection increases the activity of HMGCR, which is associated with the inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation by metformin reduced HMGCR activity, suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. The study also found that HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. Metformin and lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, disrupted this co-localization and replicative complex formation, supporting the idea that active HMGCR is required for replicative complex formation. Furthermore, metformin showed a dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, increased viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. These findings suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complex formation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replication and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understand the process of tRNA translocation on the ribosome, a crucial step in protein synthesis. By using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, they were able to bridge the gap between kinetic measurements and the energy landscape of the ribosome. This allowed them to estimate the free-energy barriers associated with tRNA translocation. The study found that the process can be decomposed into slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations. The researchers identified specific regions of the ribosome that undergo these movements, including the 30S-body rotation, 30S-head swivel, and tRNA displacements. These motions are essential for substrate translocation and protein elongation in the cell. The study provides a quantitative framework for understanding and interpreting data related to tRNA translocation, which can be applied to other biological processes. The findings suggest that the ribosome functions as a "thermal ratchet machine," where random energetic fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive configurational rearrangements. The researchers used single-molecule methods to project the free energy onto specific coordinates, allowing them to establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape. This approach provides a unifying foundation for understanding the dynamics of the ribosome and its role in protein synthesis.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a rare type of thyroid cancer. They analyzed tissue samples from 84 MTC patients and found 101 genetic mutations in 18 different genes. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases. Other frequently mutated genes included those encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine kinase 11, and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog.

The researchers also looked for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in the MTC samples. Two out of 98 samples tested positive for ALK rearrangement. Further analysis revealed two types of ALK fusions: glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK. The EML4-ALK fusion was found in a metastatic MTC case that showed a significant response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. This suggests that the EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target for ALK inhibitors.

The study also identified several other genetic mutations in MTC, including RET, RAS, and MET mutations. These mutations were found in both sporadic and familial MTC cases. The researchers conclude that their findings provide new insights into the genetic landscape of MTC and highlight the potential for targeted therapies, such as ALK inhibitors, in treating this type of cancer.
Researchers conducted a study in Malda district, West Bengal, India, to understand the role of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the spread of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Asymptomatic cases were identified through active mass surveys in eight tribal villages using rapid diagnostic kits. Out of 2,603 individuals screened, 185 tested positive for antileishmanial antibodies, with 96 having a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such a history. Seventy-nine individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases, and 10 were diagnosed with active VL. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1.

The researchers followed up with the asymptomatic cases for three years to observe sero-conversion and disease transformation. During this period, 8 out of 77 (10.39%) asymptomatic cases developed symptoms of VL, while 62 (80.52%) showed sero-conversion. Seven individuals remained seropositive after three years. The study found that asymptomatic cases can progress to clinical disease at any time up to three years after the initial survey. The researchers emphasize that the presence of asymptomatic cases does not guarantee that an area is free from leishmaniasis, as symptomatic VL or PKDL can appear even after three years.

The study highlights the importance of addressing asymptomatic cases in the VL elimination program initiated by three neighboring endemic countries. The prevalence rate of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the study area was 3.16%, which is lower than rates reported in other studies in Bihar. The findings suggest that asymptomatic infected individuals require attention to prevent future epidemics.
Researchers have developed a new technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These rearrangements, known as gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), can lead to genetic diseases and cancer. The study found that the introduction of a repetitive retrotransposon called Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of S. cerevisiae led to increased genome instability, primarily due to the formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations.

Using MLPA, the researchers analyzed a large number of GCRs and found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 was nonrandom. They discovered that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, despite the presence of 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. The study also found that the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, but a significant number of nonreciprocal translocations were mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements.

Furthermore, the researchers found that defects in the acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy. The study suggests that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.
Researchers have developed a new method for predicting how proteins interact with each other, a process known as protein docking. This method, called Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation (SDU), uses a mathematical approach to find the most likely position and orientation of two proteins in space. The method is based on the idea that the interaction between proteins is driven by a "free energy funnel," a concept similar to how proteins fold into their native shape.

The SDU method uses a combination of rigid body motions and flexibility of the proteins' interface side chains to find the optimal position and orientation of the proteins. However, applying this method directly to the space of rotations and translations is challenging due to its geometry. To overcome this, the researchers introduced a new strategy that separates the search space into three independent variables: side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules.

This approach allows the method to efficiently explore the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes, which are local free energy minima. The results show that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with high accuracy, with an average ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation of less than 5 Å, while achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The successful application of SDU to protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state.
